  narration: "Howdy hello hi and welcome back to the Civ Battle Royale! Part 28, eh? Who‘d have even thought the game would still be running? All praise to u/TPangolin and his wizardlike ways.\nThis is u/ProletariatCossack signing in... only kidding, it‘s u/LacsiraxAriscal here, purveyor of maps, more localised AI games and rambling bile-filled speeches over at r/CBRModelWorldCongress. Don‘t know what I‘m talking about? You should probably be checking out all the fun and games over at r/civbattleroyale! Critics say just 10 minutes there can change your life... forever.\nI‘m going to narrate blind, so I have just as little idea as to what‘s going to happen as you do. If I make any enormous oversights then tell me all about it in the comments and I‘ll try to beg your forgiveness.\nLet‘s get this show on the road!"

  narration: "And hey, exclusively for this episode we have the relationship graph, courtesy of arguably the hardest working member of the community, u/mazerlaser! I can‘t even begin to get my head round all of this, but one thing of particular note is that N American alliance building up between Canada, the Blackfoot and Texas. With the Americans celebrating a transition to Freedom, could this largely autocratic alliance find a small rump state to skewer? I‘d be selling my stocks if I were you...\nAlso of note: Kimberley out there on the left, denouncing, warring and befriending nobody. It must be nice to live in that most peaceful corner of the world."

  narration: "Onto the action proper!\n...Only joking, it‘s Yakutia. They seem to be on the front foot in their long war against the Inuit, with ground troops on Qamchatqa and a not too shabby fleet besieging Taloyoak in the north. And that‘s not all - Tygyn Darkhan‘s yawning Yakuts are the second to make it the Modern Era! I‘m not sure exactly what techs they researched to get there, in that they‘re still mainly fighting with pikemen, but still - every achievement is an achievement.\nDown south, the blockade of Hiroshima seems to be stalling. Yakutia need to start focusing their attacks more if they want to make any real progress. It should be pointed out that they are yet to take and hold a city for any considerable amount of time."

  narration: "Ah, the token Maori shot. And really, what can be said here that hasn‘t been said a thousand times or more? Were the Maori placed somewhere outside Europe, or the east coast of America, we‘d be calling them one of the strongest contenders for victory. Next to Australia they look like sitting ducks waiting to die. Still, at least they‘ll leave a legacy of some healthily populous cities."

  narration: "Fact of the day: the Chinese version of ‘speak of the devil‘ is ‘speak of Cao Cao‘. And that should tell you everything you need to know about Cao Cao.\nThe Kimberley, I‘ve thought, have long been one of the most underrated nations of the game. In previous episodes I‘ve thought that despite a less powerful navy their land army has always looked more threatening than Australia‘s. But that now no longer seems to be the case; in fact, Australia looks to be readying its rifles at the border. One somewhat reassuring thought for Kim supporters is that the nearest city to their borders, Hobart, is puppeted and so can‘t create units. Still, it would be a long, fierce battle should these two nations go to war."

  narration: "Speaking of war... Afghani troops close in on Susa. Taking a small border city may not seem like much of an achievement, but head back just a couple of episodes and you‘ll see Susa was by far the largest city in Persia. Really, the damage has already been done - but it seems doubtless that Afghanistan will finish the job.\nIt‘s not all over for Darius (Persia) yet though, as his northern fronts still look secure. The Timurids are throwing themselves at Ghazni to no avail while Armenia... yeah, I don‘t know either. And though Susa must fall, Gordium will be a much trickier acquisition, thanks to those helpful mountains."

  narration: "Day 9382 of the Roman log books:\nSince being exiled from Armenian Anatolia we are still trapped on this canoe in the Black Sea. Poor Marcus Inferius has gone mad, claiming he can see strange ships in the distance, unlike any in Europe or Asia, with strange, flightless birds wandering the decks. We humoured him and gave him some of the last shreds of our remaining rations. There has been no sign of our friends and brothers the ballista company for weeks. If our Byzantine ‘friends‘ in Crymea don‘t admit us soon, surely we will starve. Life is hell. ~ Julius"

  narration: "It‘s not often in this adventure we can say that Central Asia is at peace, and yet here we are. Still, I wouldn‘t say things look particularly rosy for our Hunnic brethren right now. The Inuit DoW on the Sioux last episode is proof that, yes, the AI can be that greedy when it comes to useless tundra cities. It can‘t be long until Finland decides the area would look much nicer in two shades of blue.\nElsewhere, check out all those forts outside Mosul. The AI really don‘t build forts very often, so perhaps that‘s a sign that all is not as flowers and sunshine in this neck of the woods as the current situation may have you believe. Sibir has open borders with Finland and generally seems to be on good terms with the Keks... so could it be the now officially Communist Soviets who will attract Kuchum Khan‘s ire?"

  narration: "Oh... Oh my. I don‘t really know how to sugar this pill. Maybe some time in the Babylonian sub will help Poland with their dreams of into space?\nThe warmongerer penalty that Sparta is about to pick up will be an interesting one. Warsaw is practically undefendable for Sparta, being on an open plain surrounded by three strong empires. But Leonidas has pulled stranger things out of the bag."

  narration: "As an official Portugal supporter (even if my heart will forever be in the Philippines) last episode was a joyous one, with the scary Bucs conceding peace with Maria‘s fair nation. And I‘m not particularly scared of a Chilean threat, either.\nSo where now for Portugal? Well, Braga is very undefended - but Maria and Ahmad (Morocco) have long been fairly close friends. I think a more interesting prospect lies up north: observe that great general stationed outside Hastings. England is already facing war from France and Ireland; could Maria seize the initiative and grab Hastings for herself? Let‘s face it: it‘s unlikely. Still, I think we can watch the plucky Portuguese with increased interest after their lucky escape from the pirates."

  narration: "As the world rockets into the modern era, some nations decide to take... how shall I put this... somewhat smaller leaps forward. And that‘s fine. Mao knows what he‘s doing, I‘m sure - after all, he‘s survived this long.\nHeaven knows what the Mongols are up to, though. Tabriz - their old city! - is being handed to them on a plate. But Genghis seems to have accidentally inherited Gandhi‘s personality and has done nothing for centuries, now. So my money‘s on the ultimate irony: Tibet to take out Mao Zedong. You heard it here first."

  narration: "Ouch. Is this episode going to be a fabled double elimination? It‘s sure looking that way. Still, that city will be happier in White Walker hands than Sioux ones.\nHow about we play a game for the rest of the episode? If anyone spots any Polish or Sioux troops wandering the lands, carrying the last banners of their crippled empires, tell us in the comments!"

  narration: "Oh my god! Did I say DOUBLE elimination? I might have to increase that number as the Boers enact a triumphant offensive to the Congolese coast, conquering every single city in Nzinga‘s possession! And with only three triremes left, this might actually be the end for the Kongolese empire. Who saw that one coming before Poland and the Sioux?\nIt‘s a shame to say goodbye to Kongo; I was always a fan of them back in Mk. 1. But they did very little this time round, losing all their northern forward settles very quickly and failing again and again to take even the simplest of cities in Mampong. When even the Zulu can take a city off you for some turns, you know you‘re doomed."

  narration: "‘Murica count Brazil among their democracy-lovin‘ friends. People always bark on about the Buccaneers doing a triumphant rampage through American soil - but I think Lincoln packs more of a punch than you might think. I sure don‘t see any Gatling Guns in any of their immediate neighbours - indeed, Texas‘ military looks a lot weaker than the Union‘s. And Petit-Goave‘s main defense corps consists of three scouts. Sure, those corsairs would put Lincoln‘s coastal cities in a pickle - triremes, Lincoln? This is the modern world now - but there‘s fat chance of the Bucs making it into Lincoln‘s northern, inland core."

  narration: "Back in Mark 1 I was a Carthage supporter, so I still feel a little invested in the ol‘ clover greens. And I have to say, after a troubling last couple of parts I‘m now pretty sure they‘re about to pack the punch that could see Ayyubids put in the grave for good. Muskets and war elephants can tear through the few meagre crossbowmen that Saladin is fielding. And whatsmore, the Ayyyyubids have no reserves. I‘m confident we‘re looking at a new, greener dawn."

  narration: "I‘m impressed that Hastings has managed to hold on to 21 population in light of the war echoing through its walls. Elizabeth‘s last English stronghold is threatened by a few frogs, but it‘s going take more French soldiers than that to bring the city down. If Ireland really committed, however, the sun would surely be setting on the British Empire."

  narration: "The Mongols could do with less crossbows and more muskets, or even keshiks. Still, when you compare the Golden Horde to the Silver soldiers to the west... Genghis Khan could probably do a lot of damage.\nYakutia, meanwhile, have apparently forgotten how to build anything except for gatling guns and workers. A war between them and the Mongols would be an interesting if probably fruitless one.\nOh, why are we even bothering with this? We all know Siberia is doomed to eternal peace. Next!"

  narration: "Controversial - a mid-episode stats shot. If any of these come as any surprise, you clearly haven‘t been following the series very well. With that said, it‘s interesting that Tygyn of the Yakuts is only 7th despite being one of the few leaders to break the modern era barrier."

  narration: "Let‘s see... dead, dead, dead, dead, nearly dead, dead... David? Oh dear. There‘s no real reason for Israel to be doing so terribly. I think it‘s just the AI‘s tendency to missionary spawn rather than do anything useful at all. Still - with Armenia, Persia, Arabia and the Ayyubids for neighbours, we‘ll be seeing their scouts for a while yet."

  narration: "It could ONLY happen on turn 300. The Spartans celebrate their recent industrial breakthroughs and break down the gates of Warsaw and eliminate the Poles once and for all. Furthermore, the Poles don‘t even get the comfort of beating the Kongolese, as a quick look at the minimap will tell you that they have recaptured Nkuna in the south of their old empire.\nOh Poland Poland Poland. What went wrong? We had such high hopes for you. Be it a terribly powerful UA and UU, or your stirling performance last time round, it seemed nailed on that the STRONK flag would be flying over Europe before too long. But the Lambda Leg-Warriors proved too much, unless that pikeman can put in the fight of his life.\nThat‘s going to be a big warmongerer penalty for Leonidas of Sparta, as I pointed out earlier. Who‘s going to leap on Leo?"

  narration: "They said it couldn‘t happen. They said a single Ashanti pikeman would be ruining it for everyone else. Those more positive looked to the naval nations of Hawaii and Australia as our only chance in seeing a world government more dignified and structured than the Model World Congress. No one, I repeat, NO ONE looked to the Pashtuns. But it is Afghanistan who host the first ever World Congress in Kabul.\nIt won‘t be for 25 turns though, so let‘s not think about that right now. Instead, have a gander to the right. Everyone‘s least favourite continent just got a mite more interesting."

  narration: "This is turning into the episode where dreams come true. After several millennia of stagnation, could this be the war that turns South America into a bloodbath? The odds are looking good: a coalition from the two strongest nations of the continent on arguably one of the weakest. A large land army just a stone‘s throw away from Buenos Aires, looking to repeat the successes of Chile Mark 1. And a Brazil that boasts the only riflemen on the continent. This could be carnage."

  narration: "A look at the northern front. It certainly looks somewhat more even up here, and if the Colono War was good for anything it was telling us that land wars in the Amazon basin are never particularly good ideas. But rifles against muskets could be the key difference here.\nAlso, take a gander at the minimap. The Sioux‘s last stand apprently didn‘t even dignify a screenshot, but their final stronghold has fallen in what has to be the least glamorous death of the series so far. I think it‘s a crying shame to see the Sioux go, as they‘ve been one of the most consistently plucky nations in America for the whole game. In many ways I saw them as the American equivalent of my beloved Philippines - not doing a great deal wrong, but garnering the hatred of the world for some unknown reason.\nGah, things are really heating up this episode and we‘re only at slide 24! I‘m feeling pretty lucky to have this one."

  narration: "Ohmanohmanohman, could this episode get any better? Kuchum Khan of Sibir just can‘t sit still, and declares war on Stalin, taking Genghis of Mongolia with him. It would have been nice to have seen the two Khans clash heads again, but oh well, this is the next best thing.\nI do like ol‘ Kuchum; he‘s certainly been one of the most entertaining additions this time round. But there‘s one thing on my mind - what will Finland do? They‘ve been loyal to both Stalin and Kuchum in the past. Will they turn on one of their old allies or will they remain neutral?\nAlso, remember that Pole/Sioux-spotting game?"

  narration: "The northern front of the Ural War, and likely where most of the action will take place - the Tundratowns of northern Russia. Sibir have an obvious advantage here, although Stalin‘s navy could produce a situation similar to the Kongolese War down south. Nevertheless, Tbilisi has already started taking damage, and Baku will surely be next to follow."

  narration: "This may be the last ever shot you see of the Kongolese empire. For once the trireme in Nkuna is felled, Kongo have no more units capable of taking cities.\nBut it‘s not all fun and games for Mr Kruger of the Boers. His army has been exhausted by the Kongolese War, and even a DoW from the Zulus would be problematic at this point. An Ethiopian one could be fatal."

  narration: "A shot of the Sioux-conquerors. If there‘s anything the Inuits like doing, it‘s city spamming. The Inuit city list is quite long, and look how many loan names there are - in this shot alone, I see Tara, Ciudad Guayana, Samara, Cill Choinnigh, Aracaju, Istaravshan and Windsor. And there‘s at least two more cities to the east that we haven‘t even seen yet. I‘d be interested to see the Inuit‘s happiness score."

It‘s certainly not the obvious place for Parkes (Australia) to plop his ships, so what‘s afoot? Could the Maori soon be feeling the heat, or is it Hawaii who‘s about to be paid a visit from the Wobbegongs? Whoever it is, I don‘t fancy their chances. It‘s a cliche, but Australia sure do look powerful."

There‘s nothing here that we haven‘t seen before, but I think it bears pointing out that Wulungarra has very quickly become quite the population centre. Could this be the base for a spectacular voyage west? A Kimberley-Boer war could be quite the sight to behold."

  narration: "Blimey, the Afghans are taking their time. I know you guys have a congress to get ready and all, but Susa should have fallen years ago. It‘s already fallen to a single population point, from being one of the world‘s major metropolises. Yet though the city is surrounded by trebuchets, it stays pretty much on the same health as it was last time we saw it. And even if they did weaken the city - they‘ve neglected to bring along any melee units.\nArmenia and the Timurids have made no progress either. Things aren‘t looking nearly as bad for Darius‘ Persia as it first appeared."

Unfortunately for me and all the folks at r/NauYoureTalking, Maria has neglected to follow this up with a DoW, and as such it‘s Napoleon (France) who is taking advantage of that sweet, sweet defense. Indeed, Hastings has begun to take damage, finally. Blimey... could this be... a QUADRUPLE elimination? Surely not..."

A fairly strong Portugal to the north, a frighteningly competent Carthage to the east, and... well, they could probably find a good match in Mali. But were I a power ranker, I‘d be putting Morocco pretty far down right now."

  narration: "Genghis 'I already did something this episode' Khan advances to the Industrial era! Which, when you‘re right next to a modernised Yakutia and an overwhelmingly powerful Sibir - albeit one that is currently quite friendly - isn‘t really good enough. Still, the carpet is real; a punishing war against Tibet or China would be effortless, and even Yakutia looks weak to the Mongol hordes at the moment. We all know they won‘t do any of that."

  narration: "It‘s everyone‘s favourite Caribbean island-based nation, the Buccaneers! Although you‘d be mistaken for thinking Hawaii had already conquered it, what with all those oranges wandering around. For so many island cities cramped in such a small space, there‘s some big‘uns there. Port Royal is the obvious one, and Nassau has also now broken the 20 threshold along with Petit-Goave, but the whole area is teeming with baby pirates. The question, of course, is where all these infant swashbucklers will cut their teeth on the high seas. With the Portugal war fizzling out, there are limited choices left for the Jolly Rogers. America might not be a bad shout, although it would likely come at the coast of Petit-Goave. Texas has far too many allies, and the Mayans... well, the Mayans would just be boring. Perhaps another transcontinental war is the order of the day?"

A few Myanmar units have thrown themselves at their old city of Bago, but to no avail. Mountains get in the way of any other interesting possible fronts. So, a stalemate followed by Burma handing half their cities to the Trung Sisters, then."

Alas, a denouncement is one thing, but war is likely a long way off."

But THAT‘S because it‘s actually still the same turn that war broke out. Chile haven‘t even moved yet. Yeah, it‘s been an eventful turn.\nOne thing that is interesting though is that Chilean navy outside the Argentine maritime borders. Backdoor Squad much?"

Notably they annex the former Sioux capital of Hunkpapa, but not Oglala, meaning my next map is going to look really, really ugly. Thanks guys.\nTexas are still looking a lot weaker than they have done in previous installments. I even spy a few composite bowmen among their ranks, which when your neighbour has as many gatling guns as Mexico does, is not a particularly good sign. Texas should start loosening those gun laws, build more muskets and get working on kicking out those Mexicans. #voteTrump"

  narration: "Boooo, hiss, it‘s the evil Manila-grabbing Champa. I refuse to point out their powerful navy and strong strategic position on principle.\nInstead, feast your eyes on Bago, which is looking a LOT more threatened than it did just a turn ago. Burma could soon be repatriating their Siamese holdings.\nThe arrow of God wants me to tell you that Indonesia are, in fact, doing their duty and joining in the war on Burma. Go you Indonesia! That‘s your 1 bit of relevance for this millennium, now back to sleep with you."

  narration: "Still there. Still totally outclassed. The only really interesting thing I can think to say about the Maoris in this shot is that Ruapekapeka is the first non-capital city in the world to reach 31 population! This means that it will be the first city to be granted font size 18 on my city map. Yahoo! Okay, is there a war next slide or something?"

  narration: "Uh, well that‘s... that‘s certainly a screenshot. Give me 5 minutes to think of something to say about this expanse of sea...\n...\nOkay, so the Inuits look like they might be headed south. Seems an odd turn of events when they‘re currently not doing too great in a war against the great northern Snoryaks. Could they be targeting a bizarre, far off nation? Probably not.\nMeanwhile, Mexico have a few prophets swimming about, possibly looking to spread the One True Faith west to Asia. And there‘s that Korean sub, sneakily sketching out the Pacific ocean floor."

  narration: "The home front of the Ural War (which I may have slightly misnamed... the Urals a bit to the east, aren‘t they?) and it looks pretty even at the moment. Zaranj, near the site of the former Sibirian city of Chimgi-Tura has been annexed, so that‘s one more city to help the war effort for Kuchum Khan. If I were him I‘d be spamming artillery - along with riflemen, that‘s his biggest technological edge over Stalin."

  narration: "I think we can all agree that Kuchum Khan has this front in the bag, though. Stalin‘s navy looks a poor shell of its strength at the start of the episode, and Krasnoyarsk has joined Baku in taking a great deal of damage. But still - they‘re wasteland cities in the middle of nowhere. This isn‘t the important front. This is just the border-tidying part of the war."

  narration: "Call me controversial, but I don‘t think much to Em. Has she actually made any correct predictions so far? I don‘t think she has. \nNevertheless, guessing that David might declare war on the Ashanti isn‘t a bad shout. They‘re pretty much the only nation that his army has a change of beating.\nMeanwhile, I know it‘s been emphasised again and again and again, but there‘s a reason people keep banging on about the difference between the Ethiopian army and the Boers‘. Haile Selassie might never get this chance again - the time to strike is upon him."

  narration: "Semiramis, not much better than Em in terms of accuracy, offers a much more interesting war prospect. She posits that Pearson of Canada is looking west to the Blackfoot. It would be a controversial DoW - last time we heard Crowfoot and Pearson were BFFs. I can‘t say I imagine it being a resounding success either. Perhaps leave this one in the plotting stage, Pearson."

  narration: "Afghanistan have nearly captured Susa, although they‘re still yet to remember that vital melee unit. Regardless, they prematurely celebrate with another DoW, this time on David. In the event that they tear through Persia, this might become relevant, but until then it‘s another meaningless war, along with Napoleon‘s joint DoW. I‘m trying desperately hard to ignore the irony in Napoleon‘s DoW against the nation that controls Syria.\nLet‘s look at that ideology instead!"

Every time I see them I feel a mixture of pity and nausea.\nSomeone has literally just asked me something about separating Sweden‘s German and Polish puppet states on the map. Well, newsflash: all that‘s irrelevant as Sweden annexes Krakow. Elsewhere, brave Julius lands in the Caucasus, ready to start a new life for his Roman brothers in arms."

Armenia - the apparent defenders - do have open borders with Israel, but I don‘t see them getting through that wall of prophets and pikes.\nTo the west, Bilbais is still the centre of the Great North African War. I wouldn‘t be surprised if that war was still raging on in 20 parts time, still over Bilbais."

Oh well, at least Mirwais of Afghanistan is STILL yet to bring a pointy stick to the Battle of Susa, and the Persian War looks much the same as it did back in Slide 7. Where Susa has fallen, Pasargadae has risen, having now become the main population centre of the Achaemenid Empire."

Good-for-nothing cowardly purple pirates grumble grumble grumble.\nUp north, we can see the Bago ‘offensive‘ has been cut back and both Burma and Vietnam now sit back on their haunches. East Asia has been the least interesting region in this episode, for sure."

  narration: "Oooooooooohhhhhhhh boy. Fans from Mk. 1 will remember a series of entertaining wars between sparring partners Stalin of the USSR and Tiridates of Armenia. Those who joined us for this series may remember at least Stalin‘s invasion and razing of Gavar (near where Tashkent is now). Well, it‘s time to get the ball rolling again. Stalin tried and failed a thousand times to take Yervantashat, not far from where Yervantashat is now, back in Mark 1. Can he get luckier this time? Or will the vodka go to his head again? On a side note, thaaaat‘s where the ballista has got to. Clearly the legion told them to meet on the big sea near Armenia... not realising there were two."

In the top right, you can see Chile‘s privateer replacement, which earns experience 75% faster and can be upgraded at half price to a Destroyer, meaning Chile will have a terrifying navy soon enough. I‘m going to put my hands over my eyes and pretend I can‘t see how boringly the Brazil-Argentina War is going. Things will get better soon... right?"

While finally hitting the industrial era (I‘d have thought they‘d be more advanced by now, to be honest), Chile digs right into Argentina‘s core. Their navy, joined with Brazil‘s, is utterly indomitable. We haven‘t seen a single South American nation conquer a city yet, but I‘m confident that next part might just be the one."

Leonidas (and Shaka, uselessly), finished with Poland, is throwing the Spartan might back at an old enemy - the Ayyubids. With Carthage putting more and more pressure on, could this be the final pile-on for Saladin‘s beleaguered nation? We‘ll find out next time, because it‘s time for..."
