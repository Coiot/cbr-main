  narration: "Greetings boys and girls! My name is u/theutterchrisp and after a long hiatus I’m back to bring you another part of the great Civilization V Battle Royale! Do you find yourself desperately wanting more blood, sweat, drama and rightfully so? Good, because here it comes!\nLast time on the Battle Royale, major developments included the beginning of a very one sided war for Hawaii, who subsequently ended up defending itself (rather poorly) against allied Blackfoot and Chilean forces. In addition, further happenstances featured the ongoing Kimberley/Sri Lankan war which had received a boost from Australia’s own Henry Parkes. But what are we waiting for? Exposition only serves to get in the way of some good, old-fashioned violence!\nTitlecard by the amazing environmental artist /u/NickJizba!"

  narration: "Before we begin, take a moment to appreciate the hard and brilliant work put in by u/Malssistra and /u/LacsiraxAriscal for this rather fantastic map of the contemporary world. Be sure to take a moment to appreciate it in its full resolution, if only because the web of time continues to weave, and the world shall never look the same again."

  narration: "When children are naughty, do their parents ever consider grounding them, threatening them with a lump of coal from Santa, or serving them less treats? Not so! Instead, children bed-wet all around the world thanks to horrifying old-wives tales of Paul Kruger, the Boergyman, an eternal cyborg demigod who lives in your closet or under your bed. As the old couplet goes, Swear allegiance to orange and blue, else the Boergyman is gonna get you!”\nShoutout to the Power Rankers for all of the utterly awesome work and analysis that they do!\nHere‘s a link to the full analyses: http://imgur.com/a/YUdXr/layout/horizontal#0"

  narration: "And we’re off! Firstly, we’ve been treated with an aerial shot of the Iberian Peninsula. \nThings seem largely peaceful around here, if a little congested, with a noticeable Spartan presence in the Mediterranean sea and at least ten aerial units, bombs notwithstanding, stationed in the Buccaneer city of Coimbra. Of special interest here is the visibility of Vietnamese units in Pirate occupied territory. All seems nice and cordial for now, but this serves to prove that the Trung Sisters (of Vietnam) apparently have the ability to project power onto the opposite side of the Eurasian landmass. Relax everyone, maybe they’re friendly.\nWho wants a fun fact about irl Henry Morgan? Gonna be presumptuous and assume that most of you said yes. Mister Morgan, like myself, was Welsh! Sit tight, England, Ireland and Scotland, our home isles may be occupied, but it looks like Captain Cymru has got you covered."

  narration: "Trouble in paradise? It would certainly appear so, as Hawaii continues to exist under grave threat from the Chilean Backdoor Squad and the Blackfoot Stompers (patent pending). All Kamehameha (of Hawaii) has in terms of defense appears to be a miscellaneous assortment of great people, settlers and workers. That may work when colonizing the Americas, but it certainly isn’t going to protect the Polynesian homelands.\nThey can take some comfort in the fact that, at least for the moment, the Partition of Paradise appears to have come to a halt. Despite Hilo and Kailua-Kona falling dangerously into the red, enemy forces forgot to bring melee units to a siege fight."

  narration: "Just north of the Indian subcontinent, the very bloody Afghani-Vietnamese conflict rages on in an apparent stalemate, with four cities up for grabs but with no way for either side to break the line yet. The Vietnamese have the distinct technological advantage here, and who could blame them? Being an expansive empire which borders Australia, Korea, Yakutia and somehow, Finland, means that they really have to stay on their toes to maintain their impressive geopolitical position.\nSpeaking of the Finns, notice their enclaves amongst powers many miles away from their capital. The Finnish carpet actually appears to dwarf anything that Afghanistan or Sri Lanka could throw at them, putting them in a great position to expand down here rather than the absolute militarized death-lands that are Northern and Central Europe."

  narration: "We are the Boer. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile. \nDomo Arigato, Mister Roboto. I remember missing the fact that the Zulu had finally invented the Impi when I narrated last, and now here we are with a bloody terminator squad staring down the Ethiopian capital. Requiring no pre-requisite resource to build, with a combat strength of 120 and a movement speed of 3, these particular Backstreet Boys are certainly not “alright”. They’re actually tremendously scary. Upon hearing such news, Haille Sellasie (of Ethiopia) decides to fight fire with fire, and asks his most trusted scouts to locate Christian Bale. “WHERE IS HE?!” he screams."

  narration: "Congratulations to Kamehameha! Watching the bloodletting and naval battles rage from outside his emergency home in Hilo, the science advisor comes stumbling in, falling over his robes.\n“Sire, sire, we have entered a new era of information!” the scientist beams.\n“Fantastic news! Pray, what have you got for me? Chariots of fire, an army of predators, or a god damned proficient navy?” asks Kamehameha.\n“Well... we certainly discovered something sir,” the scientist says, shuffling awkwardly, taking a sudden interest in inspecting the area around his feet.\n“Well?! Spit it out, man!” shouts the Hawaiian leader.\n“Well we did the equations, sir, all the variables (Y and Z), pitted against us (X).”\n“What did you find out?”\n“I’m sorry to say, but it turns out that in this case sir, X equals Fucked.”\n“Now that’s efficiency,” grumbles Kamehameha."

  narration: "A look now at the Sioux city-state of Mdewakantonwan. Sitting Bull (of the Sioux) appears to be keen to just sit tight, start global foreign wars by proxy, build up an army (now featuring musketmen!) and scoff at the completely empty Mexican enclave of Fort Howdtheygethere.\nWhen it comes to fort-play, it’s also of note that Sitting Bull has no less than two stationed right on the border of the hilariously named Mexican (former Sioux capital) city of Hunkpapa. I’ve been called that before."

  narration: "The Inuit, a country whose fastest growing exports include snowglobes, fish and active nuclear weaponry.\n A look now at the easternmost holdings of the mighty, frozen and trigger happy Inuit Empire. Even here, in arguably the quieter parts of the Inuit homelands, we see a formidable fighting force comprised of Power Armour Infantry and a threatening looking navy. Easily the uncontested military power of Northern America, it’s only a matter of time before they swing their attention to the rather upstart Blackfooters, who also appear to have spent a little bit of their pocket money on boomsticks and parachutes. That’d be a battle to watch. \nNo one mind the Aussies, they’re just passing through."

  narration: "In the grim darkness of Northernmost Siberia, the Yakutia/Sibir nuclear war rages on, now with more Power Armour, fallout and radioactive Yaks.\nNow that the Boers have left Yakutian territory, a gigantic handicap on the former sleeping behemoth has been lifted. To my knowledge, Yakutia has always had a strong core and a good economy, so they should be churning more and more units out. However, the inherent flaw in this war is the sheer inaccessibility between the two empires clashing swords. Thanks to a Swiss Genghis Khan, who has chosen to help neither side and remain aggressively neutral, a narrow mountain pass situated next to a lake is the only pathway between the two gargantuan nomads. Narratively speaking, that’s pretty freaking badass, in a game setting, it’s a pain in the arse. One or both of these belligerents need to seriously invest heavily in some paratroopers, or at least gunships for unit control."

  narration: "Colombo has fallen! The former enemies, Australia and Kimberley, now find themselves in an alliance of convenience against the reddish-menace of Sri Lanka.\nAustralia is showing more and more that it’s capable of modernizing its navy. Perhaps not up to the standards of the Boers or Buccaneers, but they’ll get there eventually. Their insistence on using wooden boats for the longest time has been a severe thorn in the mighty kangaroo’s side, so this war on Sri Lanka may teach them some valuable lessons. Or maybe Henry Parkes is just a renaissance romantic at heart.\nI doubt it.\nAs an aside, if this slide is to be believed, Henry Parkes is currently “technically winning”. Props to Australia in their reverse colonization of the rest of the world, which is a charming bit of historical irony."

  narration: "“An act of war on Babylon?!” screams The Daily Rag.\nProbably not, but due to the Aussie conquest of Colombo, Recruit Semiramis (like Ramis, but only half the fun) has had to flee back to the mysterious Babylonian submarine. The spies are fascinating to me, omnipresent, eternal watchers of the world, in war and peace, immune to nuclear strikes, unrivalled manpower and only vulnerable to the others of their kind.\nSo whilst the spy wasn’t harmed by the sudden Australian blitzkrieg of his Sri Lankan home, it probably made him jump."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part53-scene14.jpg'
  narration: "Apparently it’s “Red Week” in the submarine this time, as Semiramis is immediately bundled back off to another red nation, Morocco, home of the infamous Ahmad al-Manslaughter, scourge of the Ashanti and Carthage. I’m curious to see if they have any plots against their booty-loving northern neighbours…"

  narration: "Remember when we were all scared that Australia would wreck Vietnam? Here we have that oh-so “vulnerable” Asian empire sporting a terrifying land army and a brutal looking fleet of ships, featuring the advanced destroyer. The nearby Australian city has acted accordingly, naming itself, “Le Gasp!”\n…close enough.\nSeriously though, can we get an Australia vs. Vietnam round two? This time, I honestly have no idea who’d be counted as the underdog."
- scene_number: 16

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part53-scene16.jpg'
  narration: "In the nuclear quagmire that is Buccaneer-occupied West Africa, we see more examples of Vietnam projecting their power far beyond their core provinces. The evidence of open borders between these two civilizations could be seen as troubling for some. Imagine a Vietnam/Buccaneer alliance of the pacific? I for one would love to see that.\nAs an aside, the complete lack of Pirate workers in former Mali implies that the land is going to be tainted by radiation for a long time to come. Henry Morgan takes his policy of scorched earth very seriously."

  narration: "Sri Lanka! The country that has become, like the appendix or a blind, three-legged dog with a heart condition, the thing that you only really hear about when something has gone horribly wrong.\nThings are going from bad to worse for the poor chaps in the Great Indian Subcontinental War, as the Aussie fleet moves from Colombo to the western city of Kalumnai, which, despite some defensive presence, has already taken a severe beating. The Arabians appear to have taken a keen interest in the outcome of this conflict.\nNote the muted Kimberley presence in the area, I’m sure that’s not building to anything..."

  narration: "Khost has fallen! The lines of the Vietnamese/Afghani war finally, and inevitably, break in favour of the Trung Sisters. Starting this game out, who’d have thought Vietnam to be the empire which broke the empire breaker? The USA and the USSR should take notes. Things look mighty grim for the Afghans, who are still struggling with two more cities dangerously close to annexation. \nIt’s a shame that, to my knowledge, Tibet isn’t at war with them, because a city snipe there would be delightfully cheeky."

  narration: "Whilst Napoleon (of France) sits on his tree-stump, eating from his pot of honey whilst scratching his head, thinking “ho-hum, what can I do in this round?” the Great Indian Subcontinental War continues, as Australia lays claim to the city of Kalumnai. The Sri Lankan headache doesn’t end there, as their eastern flank takes a proper battering from further Aussie forces. Henry Parkes (of Australia) appears to have single-handedly set himself up for a three-pronged pincer attack on the Sri Lankan mainland, assuming he can remember to bring any land forces."

  narration: "Here we have most of the remainder of the Hawaiian empire. The growth on these cities is actually rather impressive considering their geographical circumstance, so it would be a right shame if something were to happen to them.\nOf note, Kailua-Kona is already in too deep, and it’s trying, as hard as it can, to keep up above the black, because gosh, dang and darn, it’s scared of going under."

  narration: "Freshly leaked from the Pirate City of Nassau, a document implicating the most political elite, and biggest tax avoiders on the globe! Unsurprisingly, a northern, snowy country finds itself at the absolute heart of the scandal. Gotta love a serendipitous coincidence like that, eh?\nIn all seriousness, this shouldn’t surprise too many people, as this basically represents a list of some of the scarier movers and shakers, who have the ability to reinforce their armies extremely quickly by turning gold into firepower, the Tier One and Two list if you will…and Mexico.\nJust kidding Mexico, you’re a great place. Seriously though, you’ve got an army going on there, use it! At the very least, take out Texas for the capital, or move onto Canada. Twiddling your thumbs is going to get you nowhere except eventual and inevitable Inuit occupation."

  narration: "And on the other end of the spectrum we have a couple of nations that have been legally declared dead and hilariously, below them, Japan.\nAlas, until somebody puts him out of his misery, it would appear that the Meiji is doomed to spend the rest of the time in his god-forsaken lands attempting to loot spare change from phone booths and vending machines."

  narration: "Here we’re presented with a peaceful South America. So peaceful in fact that the two previous participants in a bloody continental war now seem to be sharing open borders. There’s lovely.\nNow for an analysis on army/navy placement.\nIt can pretty simply be summed up as, Chile, what are you doing? The Brazilian frontline looks like it belongs in Kaliningrad, yet all O’Higgins (of Chile) appears to be focused on is naval conquest to the west. I’m quite the quiet fan of Chile, after it’s cross continental success of the first battle royale, so to see them under such self-imposed threat here is a little bit upsetting. Don’t get complacent Chile, the Buccs aren’t Brazil’s only target."

  narration: "The Sri Lankans strike back!\nIn a stunning turn of events, which will totally not be completely undone oh-so very shortly, the Sri Lankans stir up some nationalistic fervor and recapture both their capital and Kalumnai from the Aussies. Henry Parkes rages, screwing up the memo and hurling the ball at the messenger’s face. He misses and hits the Kimberley Ambassador instead. Nothing lost there then, he shrugs.\nTo the north, we see a couple of Korean Privateers. Come on, Sejong! You’re supposed to be the nerdiest, most smartest civ that there ever was."

  narration: "Here we catch our first real glimpse in this episode of the Icelandic occupied United Kingdom – now with more Vikings. Take a look at that fleet that they’ve got going on. It’s pretty impressive isn’t it? Now compare it with say…the French’s.\n“Why, u/theutterchrisp, white stallion of a man that you are, would you draw attention to the French over the Swedish?” you may find yourself asking.\n…No reason, honest guv.\nAs an aside, anyone want to contest London to Nottingham as the safest road in the world? Ignore the smoke, it’s just a feature."

  narration: "And in the Oh God Why corner, the Yakut/Sibir nuclear stalemate continues unabated!\nI would appear to stand corrected over an earlier comment I made about the state of the front-lines, as this slide reveals that there is in fact a second ridiculously-contrived-and-suicidal route between the two nations, just north a bit of Amga. Seriously, most inconvenient war of all time? I can’t wait for this conflict to shift one way or the other, assuming it does, because both sides have committed, and in turn lost, so much to this particular bloody mess."

  narration: "The Kimberley simply won’t stand for any Sri Lankan retaliation nonsense!\nSensing their chance due to a gap in Aussie logistics and a severely crippled Sri-Lankan defense, the Kimberley navy sweeps in and nabs the capital, bringing Henry Parkes down to four total and off from the top podium. The Kimberley would do well to grab as much territory as possible before a potential round two between them and the Wobbegong.\nOff screen, the face of nuclear victimization, Mansa Musa, completes the Manhattan Project. Don’t worry Henry Morgan, I’m absolutely positive that the three-eyed, green skinned Mali leader in absolutely no-way bears any sort of meaningful grudge."

  narration: "Chile has entered the information era! A thorough well done to Bernardo O’Higgins, who really needs to consider halting the celebrations and getting a carpet of powerful, contemporary units if he wants to survive the next couple of parts.\nMaybe I’m doing Chile a disservice, they certainly have a very capable navy, as evidenced by the ongoing Polynesian conflict, yet a hell of a lot of Brazilian cities are inland, and very difficult to get to as a result. It’s about context Bernardo, read the bloody map."

  narration: "Great news for all of our crab readers, you’re still legally recognized by the world congress. You may want to consider a life in Armenia or Brazil, who seem particularly keen on you. I’m sure that they just want to make friends, like.\nAlso of notice, the Blackfoot may be making a bit of leeway on the mainland, but these two island cities would need a hell of a lot more defense in an Inuit-Blackfoot war. Could the world congress consider banning wooden ships instead? Your guns may be sick Crowfoot, but your boats? Get with the times, bro."

  narration: "Dark times for the Republic of Pirates, as word reaches Henry Morgan’s ear, through his parrot whispering timidly, that their favorite powdery-white substance is now considered a global no-no.\n“Arrr, it be the work of the SOPA again!” he cries, downing the contents of his tankard and staggering on deck, “they can’t be destroying us from the outside, so the bastards be taking us from within!”\nHe immediately orders all of his scientists to begin figuring out which sweetener substitute best compliments the rum. Assuming that it hasn’t all, you know, gone. The Vietnamese also voted for the abolition of sugar. It appears that the bromance I envisioned between Henry and the Sisters is, for the most part, up in smoke.\nOf note, the Buccaneers still appear to have a disproportionately large amount of aircraft carriers. Could Henry Morgan be investing heavily in future nuclear production/transportation? It would hardly be a surprise."

  narration: "The Partitioning of Paradise continues as both Kailua-Kona and Hilo fall to the Chilean Backdoor Squad, who’ve taken full control of the invasion. Despite these recent gains, the fleet seems to have entirely disappeared, with the exception of two submarines, probably on “fog-busting” duty. Perhaps this is a sign that they’re ready to wind down the war with Kamehameha."

  narration: "Yep! After taking the city of Mililani Mauka, a conquest which puts Chile tantalizingly close to the border with Vietnam (think about that for a second), Bernardo (of Chile) and Kamehameha (of Hawaii), shake hands begrudgingly and call it quits. The Blackfoot don’t appear to be in attendance. This was quite the bizarre war, all things considered, as the obvious winner isn’t clear. It obviously isn’t Hawaii, relegated to two separate island cities divided by Chilean occupied waters, yet Chile did 90% of the clearing up and raked up the warmonger points, but the Blackfoot nabbed the all-important capital.\nChile made very large gains, but I smell a potential war between very recent allies brewing…"

Lord no, these are just some of our taller soldiers in some new metal sleeping bags that we’re testing. Say hello to Pvt. Jeff and Pvt. Geoff everyone!\nOf note: The Kimberley better sit tight, an Inuit missile cruiser in the neighborhood has never been good news. \nJust ask Yakutia."

  narration: "In this slide we see an absolute shit-ton of Nomads. Two gigantic nations, side by side, with absolute gargantuan unit counts. New Sarai vs Old, if you will. Genghis Khan has played the whole game surprisingly reservedly up to now, choosing instead, for the most part, to sit tight and slowly build up his unit count, letting the world burn all around him. He’s been taking notes from early game Yakutia.\nAlso, like his role model, he appears to have gained favour to the idea of letting the Boers occupy his territory. He should think hard about putting a stop to that very quickly, because as we all know, they’re just going to keep coming."

  narration: "Back to the Sibir/Yakut front, we see that not much has changed, but the people have probably chosen to live underwater. To be frank, it’s probably a hell of a lot safer. Beryozovo is in the black, whilst Amoa is in the red and Turinsk is in the yellow. This just highlights how utterly impossible it is to traverse a melee unit over land to finalize a capture. The way I see it, if the status quo continues unchanged, the only way for one side to break the front line is simply to nuke the others cities out of existence.\nJust a suggestion."

  narration: "Nursing their sore arses with ice-packs after being booted out of Yakutia, approximately .1% of Paul Kruger’s forces form a proxy army in the arctic seas north of Inuit territory. Is this the first time there’s been such concentration of the Big Two’s forces so close to one another?\nVietnam appears to have taken a page out of the Boer’s book, stationing dozens of peacekeeping troops throughout western Inuit territory. The bonus for the Inuit here of course is that, in the event of another nuclear war against Yakutia, the Yakuts simply cannot fire back."

  narration: "Korea, quite the problem that you turned out to be! \nThese chaps used to be on the chopping block thanks to Vietnam, and rather brilliantly, once upon a time, China, yet look at them now! All’s fair to the Koreans, they’ve clawed their way back from insurmountable odds, including initiating, and indeed surviving, a war against the full might of the Wobbegong assault on Japan way back when. Now here they are, boasting their prowess with their atomic bombs. Seeing as this is fully unified Korea, as opposed to Naughty or Nice, I’m not sure what to think of this.\nIt all depends on whether they’ve claimed to have discovered the Unicorn or not."

  narration: "In the heartland of the Boer Core, we see yet more John Connors patrolling the urban landscape. The military capabilities of the Boers continues to be unprecedented, if only Kruger would come out from under the bed and actually DO something.\nAlso of note, take a look at the city defense numbers of Pretoria and Johannesburg, then compare them with any other foreign city in any other slide.\nYeah, good luck, Ethiopia."

  narration: "Here we have Western Australia, in formerly Kimberley territory. Note the unit carpet that Henry Parkes is now sporting. As well as finally doing a bit of work to modernize his navy, it would also appear that a lot of his Diggers are being drafted out for significantly shinier things. This is not only, I assume, because Australia is now full of holes in the ground, but also because the presence of Future Worlds improvements in the outback implies he’s finally got the technological prowess to become a bit of a badass."

Whilst I doubt that Brazil, as the aggressor, is going to ever reach the Blackfoot heartlands in any meaningful capacity during this conflict, there are still a number of islands, including a tasty Hawaiian capital, dotted around the pacific that are up for grabs. From this slide alone it looks likely that Brazilian naval technology will utterly crush anything that the Blackfoot have to retaliate with, so it’s just a question of if Brazil will be able to reinforce with enough of a fleet to establish some real holdings and make themselves a regional pacific power."

In all fairness to Canada, they had it rough for a while there, particularly during the war against the Inuit, when they looked to be firmly cemented as “Neighbour to the Big Civ”, but they’ve staged a tiny bit of a comeback. Thing is, can they actually get that Mobile SAM dominated military through Inuit territory to Blackfoot lands?\nI’ll admit here, I’m way too amused by the whole idea of the “Hello! Don’t mind us, chaps!” Inuit, here in full force in the snowy enclave of Hamilton. Don’t mind the power armour, it’s just a body-fit radiator really.

Regardless, let’s have a proper gander at the Spartan core.\nSparta for me is a prime example of the historical parallel of superpowers rising and falling. Back in the leg day, every European nation, particularly those on the Italian Peninsula and the Balkans, feared where both Leonidas and his son, Leonidas the younger, would turn their grim, bearded heads. However, with all of that warring, I feel that the rest of the Spartan administration suffered, sending scientists to the front lines instead of actually doing their job, hence the largely backwards navy, and the crippling defeat handed to them by technologically superior Sweden.\nI don’t take joy in that, I’m a huge fan of Sparta, and I hope that they rise again. They could start by putting away that great musician, taking note of the Buccaneer fleet materializing off of Spartan waters, and upgrading their navy. They have control in parts of both the Mediterranean and the Black sea, so they cannot afford to continue ignoring it."

Which is good, oui? Well, yes, but it’s going to last them two or three turns maximum, until the rather large, technologically advanced Icelandic fleet comes down to have their way with them. I see this war being heavily one sided in Icelandic favor, but hey, what if the Swedes or opportunistic Buccaneers jumped in on French aid too?

As I briefly mentioned earlier, the more gains Mexico could make now, the much better chance they’d have of at least enduring a spell of cold weather.

They’re going to rake up some pretty heavy warmonger points for this, a city which puts them in a choke point between the Blackfoot and Mexican empires.
