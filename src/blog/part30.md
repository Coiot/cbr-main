  narration: "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to another thrilling instalment of the Battle Royale! I‘m /u/senshidenshi, reprising my role as emergency narrator for this edition! This time I‘m actually going to try to keep it short so we can get this out on time! Yeah, we‘ll see how that goes."

  narration: "We start with a look at the dwindling Ayyubid core. They’re beset on three sides – the ongoing Elephant War with Carthage, against the Spartans to the north, and very nominally against Arabia to the southeast. Last part, the Ayyubids did a remarkable job holding off all three foes; can they keep it up here?\nAlong the right of the screen, note that the Incans have declared war on the Mayans, which could prove to be relevant if they move their navy up the Pacific coast. And the Zulus declare war on Ethiopia, which isn’t likely to be relevant, given that the Boers are in the way."

  narration: "The Maori join Shaka (Zulus) in declaring war on Ethiopia. Note the Australian unique unit outside Sydney, the Prime Minister (of whom is poised to be Moving Forward). From the workshop page:\n“This Australian unique Great Person replaces the Great Writer. It provides political quotes as Great Works of Writing and when it is acquired all non-puppeted coastal cities receive +1 Tourism per owned land tile outside workable limits.”\nNaturally, this fails to mention their sinister role in the Wollongate conspiracies."

  narration: "The Korean Yellow Submarine scopes out the full extent of the Wobbegong Armada. It’s unmatched in scale, but I’m a little surprised we aren’t seeing ironclads yet. Frigates and privateers go a long way in this game, but Henry Parkes may want to consider making more use of them while he has a definitive tech edge over his neighbors.\nAlong the right, Alexios (Byzantium) declares war on the Mayans, putting the world on notice that he’s coming for them, just as soon as he’s done mopping up Finland."

  narration: "As Virconium falls to the Finnish tide, Press F for Attila and the Huns (which will also be the name of the official Battle Royale Band). Typically a strong and aggressive contender, they started off ranked #17. But they were sandwiched between surprise regional powers Sibir and Finland, and failed to take advantage of their opportunities with a strong early game UU and against weaker opponents like the Timurids.\nI guess this is what happens when you have a massive tendency to raze important cities you‘ve just captured!"

  narration: "Iceland continues to steamroll the Irish. They took Galway last part, and now they roll over Kilkenny and Waterford, giving them a foothold on the largest of the Irish Isles. Belfast is also into the yellow, and the Irish core is looking awfully sparse."

  narration: "Sweden hasn’t made much headway against Sparta yet, distracted by the rock hard abs of Lodz and Warsaw’s defenders. Neither side had done much to militarize this border; it’ll be a race to see who can move troops to the front the fastest.\nNote the Swedish Hakkapeliitta, their UU lancer-replacement that receives an extra +15% from great generals, while granting generals extra movement if they start the turn stacked with them.\nTo the east, Nicaea drops into the yellow as Alexios (Byzantium) commits suicide-by-Finland."

  narration: "Chile takes La Plata from Argentina, and O’Higgins is already pushing on to Buenos Aires, as huge numbers of Brazilian troops threaten Argentina from the north. Eva (Argentina) still has a decent number of defenders, but with a mediocre core and two much larger opponents, I could see her collapsing quickly."

  narration: "Kuybyshev falls to Sibir, who already cleared out Stalin’s mainland holdings in this part of the world. Sibir’s navy is dominant in the Arctic; it’s pretty doubtful that Vladivostok and Krasnodar hold on for long. But the real prizes in this war will be further south, where Sibir has a clear shot at the Soviet Union’s highly populated core."

  narration: "The Irish flip Waterford back and start dealing damage to Kopavogur, the long-standing Icelandic thorn in Malachy’s side.\nAnd in the ultimate slap in the face to their conquered English enemies, Ireland is building Big Ben in Dublin.\nIt seems that the Irish are too busy with their vindictive snarkiness towards the bants to produce more units for the glacial cascade of the Icelandic Polar Vortex Fleet."

  narration: "Sparta grabs the canal city of Dvin from the Ayyyybuids, and along with Carthage, drops Alexandria down to half health.\nThe Spartan carpet is looking threadbare here, probably in part to shifting troops north to fend off Sweden."

  narration: "The Icelandic fleet takes back Waterford, probably not for the last time, and brings Belfast down to almost zero health. Note the large number of reinforcements streaming in from the north, as compared to the handful of Irish units defending their homeland."

  narration: "In a bold effort to break out of an increasingly cramped stretch of North America, the Blackfoot go to war with Canada.\nWhile Itazipcho is already taking damage, the Blackfoot army on the border consists of mostly Gatling guns and pikemen, which isn’t likely to make much headway against Canadian garrison artillery.\nFun fact: The city to the south of Itazipcho, Sihasapa contains the Chichen Itza Wonder!"

  narration: "Ethiopia has built a very impressive army, but every turn they sit still, they’re really falling further behind the Boer Juggernaut. They have a prime opportunity to join the Ayyubid dog pile and pick up a couple of cities at very little cost."
- scene_number: 21

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene21.jpg'
  narration: "We didn’t see a notification, but TPangolin has confirmed that Texas and Canada are definitely at war with America now! A fair bit of America’s small army is embarked, presumably sending to go fight the Portuguese. But the Appalachians provide a very defensible border with Texas, who still hasn’t discovered artillery, or apparently even frigates.\nAs of the end of part 29, America was actually in a 5-way tie for having the 11th most # of techs, at 44 researched. In comparison, Canada had 41 and Texas had 40 – so hardly an insurmountable difference, but it does give Lincoln a nice edge in addition to his favorable geography."

  narration: "Sri Lanka enters the Modern Era, but nobody has told their admirals, who insist that the trireme is the pinnacle of military technology. Even the Mughals are fielding a more advanced navy, with a dozen or more caravels outside Lahore. At the end of the last part, Sri Lanka only had 42 techs, tied for 19th in the tech race and a whopping 9 behind the Boers in 1st. They must have rushed a particular tech to get into the Modern Era so quickly – I doubt they’ll be popping out battleships and bombers any time soon."
- scene_number: 27

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "Iglooik flips again, and the Yakutian core has been badly thinned out, with nothing to show for such huge losses against the Inuit and JaAn astute observer noticed in this week’s info dump that the White Walkers have more than double the military of the Sleep Walkers, but Yakutia’s saving grace may be at hand. Take a look at Isit – we have our first aircraft! If these start showing up in more substantial numbers, the Inuit would be wise to cut their losses before they’re kicked out of Asia entirely."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene28.jpg'
  narration: "The Boer Juggernaut enters the Modern Era, with piles of artillery and riflemen staring down Shaka’s impis and handful of musketmen. At the end of the last part, they were 16 techs apart, and that gap has probably grown since."
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene29.jpg'
  narration: "The Middle East is in turmoil as the Ayyubids take back Dvin, only to lose Alexandria to Carthage’s increasingly modern force (at least by the standards of the region). The Ayyubids have stripped their southern city of defenders to form a wall of crossbows and pikes defending their northern coast. This is a real gamble – they’re already at war with Arabia, who has mostly sat back from the conflict so far, and Ethiopia, and the Boers could devour them in a handful of turns."
- scene_number: 30

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene30.jpg'
  narration: "In retaliation for Alexios’ (Byzantine) transgressions, Kekkonen (Finland) plots to finish off even their distant Roman relatives. A handful of Finnish troops move toward Antioch, but without the artillery support to push such a narrow approach. Note that they have open borders with Stalin again.\nTo the west, Spartan reinforcements begin to arrive in large numbers – Sweden may have missed their window to pick off Warsaw or Lodz."
- scene_number: 31

  narration: "The American and Canadian navies spar out in the middle of the Atlantic. Pearson looks outmatched so far, but if he can gain the upper hand, it would help him get around the narrow land border he has with Lincoln."
- scene_number: 33

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene33.jpg'
  narration: "Lincoln is putting up a stout defense so far, and Canada’s Gatling gun-heavy army doesn’t appear well-equipped to take New York or Washington.\nBurma and Afghanistan make peace, in a war you forgot was happening."
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene34.jpg'
  narration: "Sri Lanka jumps on the Autocracy bandwagon. Southeast Asia’s difficult geography and quiet AI’s have combined to give us this collection of civs with outdated armies and moderately weak cores. I’d wager that for all of these, it’s only a question of whether Vietnam fields artillery before the Wobbegong Armada rolls into town.\nWorth noting: It seems that Afghanistan has snagged the Burmese city of Mawlamyine in the Peace deal! You can see the outline of the strategically important city on the mini-map (as well as the city only slightly being in view here too)."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part30-scene44.jpg'
  narration: "Sparta and the Ayyubids make peace, with Leonidas picking up a foothold in Alexandria and keeping Nicomedia, which they captured in the previous part. They had the Ayyubids on the ropes, but this may have been a smart call to stop now – in the last part, both the Boers and Ethiopia declared war on Sparta, and I haven’t seen a peace treaty notification for either. With the Swedish pressing in from the north, Leonidas could never have held off those two powers from the south as well; better to keep the Ayyubids as a weakened buffer for now."

  narration: "The Inuits also enter the Modern Era. The Ice Sheet Fleet remains strong, if a little uselessly focused on the north, but they have very few land units to protect their core or feed into the Yakutian meat grinder.\nThe Maori declare war on the Maya. In theory, they have the navy to do something about that, but I wouldn’t hold my breath."

  narration: "The English continue to hold off the French. Napoleon is now fielding his unique unit, the Imperial Guard, which is a rifleman replacement that increases the rate of Great General births and starts with 20 extra XP if it’s built in a city with a courthouse. This would be more powerful if Napoleon had conquered more cities to build them in, or if he made better use of his open borders with Maria."

  narration: "Lincoln continues to hold the line on land, and his small navy is gaining the upper hand as well. If he has artillery, those caravels shouldn’t be too far away from upgrading to ironclads, and he has at least two coal deposits to fuel them.\nChile also declares war on America. While O’Higgins has a strong navy that might be able to reach Lincoln’s coastal cities, he’d be better off focusing on Argentina. Plus, it’ll be bloody impossible to tell these two apart in screenshots if they really start fighting. \nWith the similar Colour Scheme and Icon that Lincoln‘s America and Chile has - I can see why TPangolin was reluctant to include Lincoln in the Battle Royale in the first place!"

  narration: "Somehow staying alive, Byzantium rolls out its other unique unit, the Lanternas! This galleass replacement has a chance to withdraw each turn and heals 15 damage during each golden age, all of which would’ve been really useful a couple hundred turns ago. Still, it does add ranged firepower to Antioch’s defense."

  narration: "Uxmal falls into the red, with caravels positioned to take it. But the real action here is off the right – we can see that Afghanistan will be hosting the first World Congress in just five short turns, considering resolutions on the World’s Fair and making Catholicism the World Religion. We also have at least 7 separate DOWs: Finland, Israel, Vietnam, Carthage, and France all pile on against the Mayas, Finland DOWs the Mughals, but the only really relevant one is that Vietnam is going to war with Tibet!"

  narration: "More irrelevant wars declared! The Timurids are on the Mayan bandwagon, and Hawaii and the Inuit are ganging up on Tibet. I’m sure the Trung Sisters appreciate the international solidarity.\nThe Inuit also pick up Autocracy, and in spite of the Yakutian air superiority, this front seems to have stabilized as both sides have depleted their armies."

  narration: "Ladies and gentlemen, the war that we’ve all been waiting for! At long last, Sri Lanka makes a play for relevance by invading the decrepit Mughal Empire. While neither is a powerhouse, the Sri Lankans have a surprising tech edge, fielding riflemen against swordsmen. In contrast, the Mughals do have a powerful cannon replacement that will be key to defending Fatehpur Sikri."

  narration: "Both sides have already lost large numbers of units, but the Mughals look decidedly sparser here. That Farsakh Cannon is insanely powerful though. The tradeoff is that it can only move when at full health, and is weaker to melee attacks – but in a defensive battle like this, it’s an ideal UU."

They start with the Cover I promotion and can be upgraded from workers. Fans of the BR Mk. 1 may recall that Diggers were incredibly effective, especially against island nations like Indonesia.\nAlso note the open borders with the Maori here – it doesn’t seem like that showdown will be happening any time soon."
