  narration: "Good evening! I’m /u/senshidenshi – yes, I know, again, but there’s a reason for that. Due to some unforeseen complications with the narration (it wasn’t me I swear), the Big Boss /u/TPangolin and I are collaborating to get you your Battle Royale fix on time! As I write this, there’s about 45 minutes until launch, so don’t expect paragraphs for most of the slides like the last time I was behind the narrating wheel – wait, narrating wheel? \nThat doesn’t make any sense! Onwards to Part 15!"

  narration: "It is said that one of the first things that a Spartan child learns to adopt is the lust for conquest and warfare. Whether or not this is true or a just cautionary tale told by a perpetually crusty old Polish man trying to instil a sense of fear and slight xenophobia in the children who frequent the public library of Poznan is completely unknown. Regardless, the same Polish children are now being told by the crinkly octogenarian that the city of Rome is in flames, and that a Portugal with a newfound sense of purpose is not going to sit back idly and just let Leonidas the Younger take a steaming dump over a once great city. Hey - his words, not mine.\nMeanwhile, Saladin brokers a peace treaty with Ethiopia, Finland, and Afghanistan - the latter two he forgot he was at war with and decided to formally end what was essentially a grand big diplomatic middle finger."

  narration: "After her escapades in the heart of the Spartan Empire, Em and her troupe pack their respective bags and head to Moscow to see how the great bear Stalin really operates, and to learn an assortment of other things that aren’t available in the Babylonian language version of Wikipedia."

  narration: "The former Argentinian colony of Parana is securely under the control of the Buccaneers for the time being. The Pirate Patrol has matched the Argentinian forces, even the workers, and also has some galleasses near the border, just in case. The Bucs look safe, at least from Argentina, however the Brazilian crossbow carpet may change that."

  narration: "Argentina and Chile look pretty well-defended, but pale in comparison to the powerful and technologically advanced Brazilian army. More notably, the Inca have managed to defeat the Chilean navy, and send their triremes off in an attempt to conquer the closest Chilean city. Well, one trireme. The rest seem to be holding back."

  narration: "Rome wasn’t built in a day, but it may well fall in one. The last few remanets of the once mediocre Roman army cling for dear life on the beaches of West Armenia. A pikeman looms close, could this be the end? Mind you, that ballista is probably in bombarding distance from Constantinople (Sparta)."

  narration: "Tiridates (Armenia) and Leonidas (Sparta) kiss and make up, probably reminiscing of part pursuits and conquests. Of course, this means Varna is now in Spartan control, cutting off Tiridates’s only route to the Mediterranean. Anyway, there are more things to worry about in the gray area between Europe and Asia: the Timurids have appeared to mobilize an army through Armenian territory. Time will tell what will result of this, time will tell."

  narration: "The Irish have surrounded the English city of Nottingham, Cornwall, and appear to be doing a decent job of whittling it down. Embarked Pikemen hope and pray they will live to bask in the post-conquering limelight, while also wishing one of the English bowmen would move so they could see it. Galleasses and Great Admirals are approaching from the south, however, so an Irish victory may not be in the cards. At least, not immediately."

  narration: "The Timurids have settled a city in the ashes of Chimgi-Tura, finally explaining the devious plots of the sneaky settlers from earlier. The Sibir border looks undefended, however, and both Hunnic and Sibir forces appear to be nearing the city, possibly spelling the doom of the tiny, weak, and frankly offensive village."

  narration: "The Zulus may have Impis, but they are yet to use them. Surrounded by the “they have a pretty big army near my borders” Kongo and the “their borders aren’t that well defended but they’ll probably kill me if I try anything” Boers, they may not get a chance to. Especially not when trade is so booming in the region, as evidenced by a singular Cargo Ship moving from the Kongolese capital to a city I don’t think I want to know how to pronounce."

  narration: "The Ayyubids conquer the once-Israeli city of Bethlehem, booting the previous, Persian owners of the city out to Jericho. Their closest melee unit is a half-dead pikeman, so the boot may stay that way. Note Bethlehem is now Islamic. Also note the gigantic Arabic army which may want a bite of the city directly next to their capital."

  narration: "East Asia unites against the Huns! Not that it matters at all.\nThe Vietnamese army is looking rather advanced, with a swarm of Galleasses, Pikemen and even Longswordsmen, a rarity in the area. Vigan (Japan) is almost Vietnamese, however a massively powerful Korean Turtle Ship has entered the water, which may turn the tides. The Burmese are marching on Hanoi, however, so the Trungs may need to try their hand at defense."

  narration: "Nelson is here, and working for the Buccaneers! With all the rum involved in the job, there will be plenty of it to preserve his corpse after his timely demise. See, that was a history fact. I’m teaching you things.\nThe waters look sparse in the Caribbean, with the Pirate Patrol off fighting wars. A Mayan trireme has breached the borders Nassau, but looks unlikely to achieve anything. Also note the Hawaiian longswordsmen around the Mayan capital. An attempt at a backdoor conquer? Almost certainly not, the Hawaiians put units everywhere."

  narration: "Dammit, Vietnam! Vigan was nearly dead! You had pikemen right there! RIGHT THERE!\nNevertheless, there is peace between the three warlords of East Asia (remember Vietnam has two leaders), as they sit down over a glass of traditional God’s Sake. As they make small talk about how Vietnam didn’t really want Vigan that much anyway, I quietly weep."

  narration: "Armenia declares war on the Huns and – holy shit, look at Virconium! The Croissant-shaped Cavaliers better known as Sibir Tartars have the city almost surrounded, but are yet to do a single point of damage. Russian knights also stroll up to Atilla’s Court. They plead for mercy – the Huns, that is."

  narration: "Leif Ericson arrives in Sri Lanka, seemingly to continue my streak of not having anything to say about Sri Lanka’s great people. Uh… hey, Leif! America’s already been discovered! Yeah, that’ll do, perfect, I’m rushed for time, shut up.\nAlso, Sparta and Sri Lanka are now at war! Whether anything will result from this is, well, pretty obvious."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part15-scene21.jpg'
  narration: "The Grand Wobbegong Armada is truly a sight to behold. Not only are the Australians the first to build frigates, they are also the first to build Privateers! Why they would want to steal anyone else’s ships is beyond me, but they are capable of it. Also note that the Maori settlement of Pukekura is currently defended by an archer and warrior. If Australia ever needs to relieve some steam, I wonder where they’ll go…"

  narration: "ScoutCon is still in full force in the Yakutian tundra, while the Inuit frontier cities seem extremely undefended. Yakutia also now has caravels, which should not bode well for his neighbours. As soon as Darkhan (Vol?) irons out any tiny errors in his master plan, Igloolik is doomed."

  narration: "The Boers enter the Renaissance, becoming the first African civilization to do so! Their armies look advanced compared to their neighbours and they’re living mostly peacefully, leaving me little to talk about, which, considering we’re in a rush, is probably a good thing. The Boers have the best city names, though. Medicine Hat has nothing on Potchefstroom or Wolfmaransstad."

  narration: "In a surprisingly relevant DOW, Hannibal has sent some triremes to assault the undefended now-Spartan city of Antium, and sent a few brave souls along with an elephant to attempt to take Sparta itself. Meanwhile, Portugal, in a drunken trance, is actually doing damage to Rome. Seeing Maria take Rome off the Spartans would truly be a majestic sight."

  narration: "In a super high definition shot of the Andean coastline, O’Higgins (Chile) has managed to turn the tides against the Incans once again, pushing the naval battlegrounds far up the coast. Notably, he has left a clear path along the coast for the Incan army, but I don’t believe the Inca are in a position to take advantage of it. Will the War of Swings ever have a clear victor? Probably not."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part15-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "The Inuits and Japan, ever the good sports, let us have the Kamchatkan Clash we’ve always dreamed of. If Ekeuhinck doesn’t move his units down the coast, though, Meiji has the clear advantage. Missionary beats worker, that’s a proven fact."

  narration: "The Blackfoot also DOW Japan, for no apparent reason! Two triremes aren’t likely to do well against a navy Meiji could easily move up the coast, but at least these guys are being nice and letting us have a Battle for Kamchatka. Screw you, Yakutia."

  narration: "Autumn falls upon Mampong, as the great Kongolese Leaf Legion covers the Moroccan exclave. While they aren’t combatting each other to my knowledge, the coverage may make it difficult for the Moroccans to spread their two pikemen out against the oncoming horde of Ashanti – yes, Ashanti – invaders. I’d say the Ashanti Army actually has a good shot here, just look at that Pikeman carpet."

  narration: "As predicted, the Irish navy has been driven away from Nottingham by the British Galleasses, however the Irish ARMY have found a foothill in Cornwall! If they can hold the position it may turn the tides in favour of the Irish! I kind of feel sorry for the Norwegian scout who has to witness this."

  narration: "Peace comes between the carvers of China, and Vietnam must be proud of themselves. Snagging a 13-pop city with a well-placed citadel in a strategic position doubly makes up for the abysmal failure which was Vigan. The Trungs will definitely want to build up a navy during peace-time, however, or else their new trophy will be overrun with Turtles. SEA Turtles, mind you, not the boring land kinds. I still hate you, Yakutia."

  narration: "Hold the phone, Austin has almost fallen to Mexico! The Texan forces seem to be focusing mainly on the Mexican city of Puebla, but the 25-pop Texan capital is a much nicer jewel to be in position of than an 8-pop Mexican frontier city. A full-health swordsman looms at the gate, there’s no way Juarez is THIS incompetent."

  narration: "Oh boy, the Philippines are about to get bombarded! With a large number of Cham triremes heading towards their ancient battleground of Olangapo, and the eldritch horror which is the Grand Wobbegong Armada barraging through their doorstep, things do not look good for the once decent Philippines. Death has knocked on Rizal’s door once more. The next step is to knock it down.\nOh, and Finland is making lots of friendly friends, which is nice."

  narration: "After years of fighting and skirmishing, the Texan Puebla Strike Team finally push past enemy lines and take hold of the city from the clutches of the Mexican Empire. Revelling in victory, and high of spirits, the Texan pikeman congratulate everyone in their squad for a job extremely well done. In a makeshift tavern made from the debris from the storming of the mayor’s palace, a messenger on horseback bursts through where the doors once stood. The message was brief, delivered with a masked foreign accent and absolutely warranted such a spectacular entrance and the knocking over of three Texan soldiers on the way over.\n“Austin has fallen. Remember this day well - for we’ll need the image of our capital burning in our heads when we ride to retake it”."

  narration: "Across the Atlantic, the inroads that the Irish have made in their invasion of England seems to have payed off. But at what cost? The seizure of Nottingham has cost the lives of many an Irishman, for the once grand city of Dublin now has its streets lined with the dead - not from the war directly, but from the famine that was incurred due to the lack of food from the sea that had kept them so well fed."

He holds up his latest creation - a large sign made from flimsy cardboard with a title that reads: “PEOPLE WHO I PLAN TO GIVE THE DIPLOMATIC MIDDLE FINGER TO”. This was then followed be a terribly drawn picture of Sejong’s face with X’s where the eyes should be."

The one person who did not ride south was the messenger on horseback. On a nearby hill that overlooked both Puebla and the Grand Mesa, he turned to a squad of tired Mexican swordsmen and said with a masked foreign accent and said “Puebla will be ours once more”.\nThe captain of the squad tilted his head slightly to the right and furrowed his sweaty brow.\n“Yo no hablo Inglés”."

Rizal, already directing his Manila Flotilla to defend against the Champa and reinforce the city of Quezon knows that Pangasinan is essentially lost to the Aussies. He’s also aware of the power that the Wobbegong Armada has in their arsenal and he’s even more aware that the worst is most certainly yet to come."

Although the powerful civ is only just entering the Renaissance Era, Ekeuhnick (Inuit) really knows how to build and sustain an empire struck with a terrible start. With several large population centers and an impressive navy - Inuit are most certainly hot contenders in a cold climate."
