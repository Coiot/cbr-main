  narration: "Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, first time viewers and veteran posters alike, and welcome back to the Civ Battle Royale! Today, serving as your narrator for Part 78 is yours truly, u/sledge115! Loyal Korean supporter, formerly active sub commenter - and recently returned from a spell of dormancy. This is only my second time narrating, after all the way back in Part 49, and I have to say, it‘s good to be back!"

  narration: "To many (players and spectators alike), the Oranje Containment Project was a bust. That by no means means the end of war on the cylinder, nor the potential downfall of the Boers. \nThe ever talented /u/Spherical_Melon returns to show us his interpretation of the events of the OCP."

  narration: "Where we last left off, Yakutia is on the brink of utter destruction as Korean, Inuit, Mongol, and Finnish forces roam where they once reigned supreme - they won‘t be long for this world. In the New World, Brazillian ground forces waving the flag of the Stop Overseas Piracy Alliance rampage across former Buccaneer lands, securing their dominion over South America. To the North, the Australians continue to pound the tenacious defense of Mexico amidst nuclear hellfire as the Blackfoot make their push - while the Inuit White Walkers begin to stir in the Land of Always Winter."

  narration: "We begin with a shot of Osaka, formerly the last stronghold of Emperor Meiji‘s fledgling Japanese Empire. While they had experienced a brief restoration with the help of the Korean Army, the Kimberley put an end to that dream and forced His Imperial Highness Sejong (Korea) to establish a puppet government. In spite of Sejong comforting him with a friendly pat of reassurance, Emperor Meiji silently weeps over Japan, and the end of his people‘s hopes to reclaim the Home Islands. Here‘s to Meiji‘s Japan, and the dreams of what could have been millennia past\nThe Kimberley invasion force sent to capture Osaka, in the meantime, has been reduced to a single battleship, facing off against a vastly superior Korean Arsenal Ship and surrounded by a massive underwater flotilla of submarines. The captain on board contemplates his options; will he fight to the last? Will he surrender to the mercy of Sejong? Or will he take another option, and end it all with a single bullet? \nWhatever his choice, the Captain stares off to the distance, as Korean-Japanese banners are raised over the city his comrades have bled for in vain."

  narration: "The Brazilian Air Force recover from another bombing run over Buccaneer-held Belo Horizonte, eager to restore it under Dom Pedro II‘s rule. The Atlantic is strangely devoid of naval activity, with hardly a trace of the once dominant Black Fleet of the Buccaneers in its waters.\nThe coast of Africa is another story; whatever‘s left of Henry Morgan‘s prized African holdings is pulverised under heavy Boer bombardment. Bamako and Sale burns, and before long all of Africa will finally be united under the orange banners of Paul Kruger‘s Dominion."

  narration: "All across the Carribean, the Buccaneers scramble to form a semblance of resistance against the fast-approaching Brazilian army. Their core will hold longer than most, for Brazil is, thankfully, lacking in a significantly powerful Navy. However, their window at expansion is closing fast, and if nothing is done then soon Henry Morgan will find himself out of options.\nTo the north, Inuit forces are steadily encroaching on the last Buccaneer holding in what should be the Continental United States in our timeline. Winter is on the horizon, and Petit-Goave will soon be theirs.\nThe Buccaneer Army presence in their South American holdings is laughably undermanned, with obsolete marines and artillery facing off against Mech Artillery and Drone Fighters. And worse still, there is still no sign of Henry Morgan committing to a naval rearmament, with scores of obsolete carriers forming a fragile wall. The Brazilian paratrooper occupying the Freeport Citadel is only the first of many."

  narration: "It‘s Ice and Fire in North America, as Blackfoot forces storm the irradiated deserts of Mexico, under the looming shadow of the Inuits to the East.\nBenito Juarez‘ once great empire is on its death throes, with the crippled Mexican army struggling to mount a proper defense against Blackfoot paratroopers scattered in every corner of their lands.\nThe clock is ticking for Benito, and winter is coming."

  narration: "It appears I was slightly misinformed about the Buccaneer strength in North America, with Cincinnati standing firm in the face of the Inuit offensive, and an Inuit XCOM Squadron is facing certain death inside Buccaneer held territory.\nHenry Morgan faces the tempting option of pushing further into the Land of Always Winter, but for that he needs men, men needed down south against Pedro‘s forces.\nThe Inuit, on the other hand, has a disturbing shortage of men in what was once Texan lands. While the bulk of their army is, at the moment stationed to halt any Buccaneer offensive further inland, Henry Morgan will surely seize the opportunity to sue for peace - or push onwards."

  narration: "Iberia burns.\nFinnish and Boer forces begin their thrust into the Buccaneers‘ first overseas holdings, setting it ablaze with nuclear fire and scorching the ground where they go.\nThe Finnish flag is raised over Goa, while a trio of Finnish XCOMs cross the Pyrenees. Boer hover tanks begin their siege of Porto. And in the former Portuguese coast, Lisbon begins to take damage under aerial bombardment.\nWith Boer reinforcements in the Gibraltar, and Finnish XCOMs looming just out of sight, things look dire for Henry Morgan‘s Trans-Atlantic empire."

  narration: "We switch on over to strategic view, where the extent of the devastation across the coast of Africa and the Iberian Peninsula can be seen in full.\nAll but one of the Buccaneer cities are in danger of capture - and as seen previously, Porto is under threat from Boer hover tanks and Finnish XCOM squadrons waiting just outside the gates."

  narration: "Crisis is on the horizon for the Buccaneer holdings in South America, for the Brazilian forces have been systematically driving them away from their inland cities, and soon enough, we might see the Buccaneers back onto square one; their home islands.\nWhile their initial efforts to conquer South America were impressive, Henry Morgan has failed to capitalise on it by building a proper, fearsome ground army - and that has cost him very, very dearly."

  narration: "We take a break away from Henry Morgan‘s ordeal to take a glimpse at another clash of titans; the Sibir Khanate against the Vietnamese Empire.\nKuchum Khan‘s forces are on the defensive, with the overwhelming firepower of the Trung Sisters‘ mechanized army staring them down in the plains and mountains of Central Asia. The last echoes of resistance are heard from the besieged city of Lashkar Gar, surrounded and beaten. And in Kabul, a ragtag defense force is bolstered by the presence of organic infantry on the field.\nBut in spite of everything, one thing is for sure; the banners of the Trungs will wave over Asia for a thousand more years."

  narration: "The last few Ethiopian soldiers stand guard in a ruined Swedish citadel, just outside the Finnish capital of Helsinski. Fleeing the capture and destruction of Ethiopia, they ponder the fate of Emperor Haile Selassie - one of a few to push for peace, if only for a brief time, in a better world.\nAnd here they stand, between the crossroads of rivals and enemies, the Lion of the North Gustavus and Lord President Kekkonen."

  narration: "Elsewhere in Finland, the rubble of a city since destroyed by nuclear bombardment remains within Sibir territory, another memorial to days gone by.\nKekkonen has yet to recover entirely from the beating Finland suffered against Sibir and Sweden years ago, with their once abundant paratroopers now gone, replaced by a few scattered units of Powered Armor Infantry. But Sibir, thankfully, isn‘t all that better off, by the very simple fact that Kuchum‘s own armored force, once the largest in the world, is nowhere to be seen as well.\nLife has an odd sense of humor."

  narration: "Oh dear.\nThings have turned for the worse - for Australia has declared against the Buccaneers.\nGod help us all.\nThe Wobbegong Armada strikes against the severely outmatched Black Fleet, filled entirely with carriers this side of South America. It‘s truly, truly ridiculous just how thoroughly the Buccaneers are being beaten in every front - and this time around, they‘re not pushing back.\nThe coveted Nassau Canal, surely Henry Parkes‘ primary target, falls to yellow under bombardment, and Huamanga is within striking range of Australian ships and Brazilian planes, falling down to red. With no end in sight to the relentless, brutal push committed by Australian and Brazilian forces, it‘s only a matter of time before South America is painted green under the banners of Brazil and Australia."

  narration: "In the nuclear-blasted wasteland of Central America, things don‘t look much better for the Buccaneers - except, for the fact that in spite of the overwhelming presence of ships from the Grand Wobbegong Armada, Australia lacks the ground forces they need to invade and push inland. And from the looks of things, only Uxmal is open for the taking at the moment.\nBut they have patience, and experience. They can afford the wait.\nAnd Morgan simply cannot."

  narration: "A Mexican Great Writer flees Mexico City, as news filters in of Blackfoot paratroopers surrounding the city. The road to Ciudad Juarez and Los Angeles is open and clear, but is it, truly?\nTired, fatigued, the writer and his companions rest on the road, with a few options ahead. Will they be safer in the fortified city of Los Angeles, where the last garrison of the Mexican army is stationed? But what about Monterrey? The city has been retaken, and the Pacific will be a safe haven for them. But for how long?\nNothing matters, the writer realises, when Blackfoot soldiers are sighted on the horizon.\nHe‘ll be taken prisoner. Tortured. Killed.\nWith a resigned, sad smile, he begins to write."

  narration: "In the plains of Central Asia, Kuchum bolsters his frontlines with robot infantry, surely a nasty surprise for the approaching Vietnamese army.\nLaskhar Gar remains standing, beaten and bruised - but standing, even as the city is reduced to rubble under UAV bombardment. Further north, Nishapur drops to the red, but with a lack of Vietnamese melee units save for a weakened Power Armor Infantry, it will hold longer than it should\nThe Vietnamese offensive begins to stall, as they struggle to reinforce their spearhead push with melee units. The mountain pass chokepoints Sibir possesses is costing the Vietnamese dearly - but unlike the Khanate, they still have a vast carpet of reinforcements waiting - and with the production bonus the Statue of Liberty grants, they can replace every loss easily enough."

  narration: "Across the Atlantic, the Buccaneers continue their rapid collapse with the capture of their Mediterranean coast by Kekkonen‘s army. Finnish soldiers encroach upon Porto, and with their home islands under threat no reinforcements will come for the Buccaneers here.\nIncredibly, the Boer presence in Buccaneer-held Iberia has all but evaporated. Where on Earth did they go?\nWhatever the reasons, Porto‘s defense is one thing Morgan can be proud of in these dark times."

  narration: "The Buccaneer collapse is only compounded by a peculiar figure, smirking in schadenfreude over their fellow civ‘s collapse - that‘s right, even the Hawaiians are joining in!\nWell, not so much joining in as they are simply cheering on, but nevertheless, the Boer soldiers found themselves entertained by the general - far from home, but commanding respect nonetheless.\nAfter all, even the Boers need a bit of levity in their lives."

  narration: "Belo Horizonte falls to the yellow, and with a Brazilian Giant Death Robot within sight, it will not remain Buccaneer for long. Lost during one of their earlier conflicts, it will soon be under Brazilian banners once again.\nPedro II remembers, and Belo Horizonte is coming home.\nPiss poor references aside, with Campeche and Freeport within range, Gran Colombiarrr will soon be devoid of Buccaneer forces, and thus fades the Jolly Roger over South America."

  narration: "In the frigid Arctic circle, Brazilian troops watches as another empire triumphs; Korea‘s victory over Yakutia is all but complete.\nWith no other options left, the Yakut government retreats to Beryozovo - a city that was, until recently, a puppet from Sibir. Now, with starvation rampant and riots in the streets, Tyghyn Darkhan can only wait for the inevitable. As with the Buccaneers, Yakutia‘s collapse has been thoroughly brutal and violent.\nLike the Buccaneers before them, Yakutia was a major power, once. And now here they are, exiled in a frigid Arctic city, barely a shadow of their former might."

  narration: "To the south of Sejong‘s massively increased Empire, however, a flotilla of Kimberley ships prepare to strike against their holdings in Japan - armed with an atomic bomb, and who knows what else in the other carriers. However small they are in numbers, they will have their revenge.\nIn spite of this threat, however, Korea has little to worry from a vestigial, sleepy empire hailing from the south. As a Korean supporter recently returning from dormancy, Korea‘s rise from an underdog-but-competent middle power to undeniably the new top dog in Northern Asia is quite the pleasant surprise. And with the Yakut threat out of the way, expansion is all the more likely - preferably the fertile lands of Australian Japan..."

  narration: "News reports from South America have brought our satellites over in Strategic View - and here, we see that either Australia or Brazil have committed the most heinous of crimes; the nuking of a classical, 1500 Vintage Distillery\nThe loss of this distillery will surely demoralise Morgan‘s already exhausted personnel, and the shortage in rum will drive them to seek a more dangerous alternative to their rum-loving ways - water.\nOf course, the most dashing of pirates will not let a simple nuclear strike ruin their supply of rum! Bring on the Nuka-Colas! Let us drink with the festivities of nuclear radiation!"

  narration: "In the Arctic Circle, Tyghyn Darkhan watches as a force of Korean hover tanks pound the walls of Beryozovo, bringing it down all the way.\nIt will take time, of course, for the rest of the Korean Army to arrive in this remote city, but there‘s little for Trigger Darkhan to do but wait for the hammer to blow.\nThere‘s still time, however, for him to relive his true passion - rapping."

And with not a city exchanged, too!\nWith this turn of fortune in Africa, the Lord Captain can now turn his attention to his remaining archrivals - the Inuit, Australia, Brazil, and Finland.\nWell, it‘s a start, nonetheless."

  narration: "Beneath the Arctic ice, a Siberian sub captain awaits orders - but with hardly any rival navies around, there‘s little he can actually do.\nKuchum Khan‘s Sibir has proven itself to be a major, ambitious competitor in the Central Asian battlefield, emerging as the best and greatest of the three Khans of the North.\nNow, however, we see their other weakness; unlike the Ice Sheet Fleet, the Sibir Navy is trapped, under both Arctic ice and behind rival borders."

  narration: "But in the case of the North Atlantic, however, it‘s a vastly different story.\nWith the fall of the Buccaneers, Ingolfur Arnarson‘s Iceland now controls the largest navy this side of the Atlantic, rivaled only by the ever competitive Gustavus Adolphus and his Swedish Empire.\nThe question remains; where will Ingolfur head next? His fleet, unlike the now depleted Buccaneer Black Fleet, has a healthy balance of melee, ranged, and carrier units. A fleet this large and powerful is a crucial aspect for Icelandic ambitions, and with rivals dropping left and right, perhaps our King in the North could turn his attention towards the Lion Gustavus, or perhaps join in the savage beating of the Buccaneers.\nBut a capture notice reminds us of the true focus, which is..."

  narration: "...the continued destruction of the Buccaneers.\nFinnish forces continue their conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, capturing Cienfuegos and the Rock of Gibraltar.  With control of the Mediterranean secure, Urho Kekkonen can now focus on conquering Porto - and he‘s almost there, as XCOM squads of his Angry Birds Paratrooper Corps stand before the gates of Porto. At zero health remaining, nothing stands between Kekkonen and the complete destruction of the Buccaneer presence in Europe.\nAnd who knows? Perhaps our Lord President here might turn his sights across the ocean as well..."

  narration: "...where a single Inuit Biotrooper unit, battered and defeated, remains within a citadel, awaiting the finishing charge from the surrounding Buccaneer land forces. But the Buccaneer soldiers hesitate; they fear the Inuit. Fear their faceless masks. Fear their silent terror. And the loss of Cincinnati, with all pirates within, only adds fuel to the fire.\nThe Buccaneer Black Fleet, on the other hand, have grown up past such silly superstitions, as evidenced by their task force to capture Dallas. It‘s not much, with battleships and all - but it‘s far, far better than their trashing in the Iberian Peninsula and Gran Colombiarrr.\nBaby steps!"

  narration: "The war rages on in South America, and with Huamanga at zero health, the noose tightens around what was once the Buccaneers‘ largest possession. On the plus size, a few bombers have finally been relocated on board one of the carriers - as I‘ve said, baby steps.\nUnfortunately, things are as dire as ever for the Buccaneers, with the still-overwhelming presence of the Wobbegong Armada utterly dwarfing any token resistance the Black Fleet could muster on this side of the Americas. Or any side of the Americas, really.\nHenry Morgan‘s fall from grace has been downright horrifying, even more so from my point of view. This is the nation that once controlled the Atlantic, from Central America to the Iberian Peninsula. And here they are, broken and beaten, under the mercy of three major powers.\nThe sun is setting on the Buccaneers, and I fear for the wars to come."

  narration: "We turn our attention back to the Arctic Circle and the former Yakutia, where Korean mechs now roam alongside the Inuit White Walkers and Finnish Angry Bird squadrons.\nThe Korean Empire‘s massive new gains will prove itself useful, should a new war breaks out in the tundra and taiga of Northern Asia. And with the technology to back it, perhaps in time Sejong will be able to counter the Trungs in the south.\nA Yakut Admiral sails out into the frozen bay, staring down the barrel of a Korean Hover Tank. With scarcely a navy left to lead, the Admiral shook his head, and spat. The tank rumbles.\nThe wind blows in silence."

But with losses against Vietnam, Australia, and even the Kimberley over the past few dozen parts, it‘s only rational for the Sri Lankans to hesistate in attacking someone under Kekkonen‘s ambiguous protection."

With Tikal already nuked, all bets are off as to when and where Parkes will use these devastating missiles.\nWith hardly any of Morgan‘s ships in sight, the Northern part of the Wobbegong Task force slowly moves south, towards Ukmal, and Port Au Prince, potentially cutting off Morgan from the West Coast of his dwindling nation."

The Buccaneer forces left in Iberia are reduced to a few outdated units, hopelessly, hilariously outgunned by the dreaded Finnish XCOMs.\nWith Lisbon at red, and another XCOM unit training their sights unto the prized jewel of Buccaneer Iberia, the ambitions of a black stained Europe will be gone forever."

And what‘s more, they could stand to make some gains here!\nWith four stealth bombers stationed in Petit-Goave, not even the feared White Walkers can make it past Florida without being reduced to shards of ice. Unfortunately, there remains a catch - the lack of melee units in the area.\nCan‘t get everything, I suppose."

It‘s all too quiet, with only the sound of the wind, and the occasional gunfire heard in the night‘s sky.\nThey knew what the embers meant, for they carry the legacy of their forebearers from the time of the Great Pacific War, when Henry Parkes triumphed over their neighbours, the Kimberley, when the upstart Maori desecrated the Emerald Down Under with their inhumane weapons.\nBut it was a war long past - now, here they stand, bearing witness to an ongoing nuclear fire and conquest in the plains of North America."

With a citadel attraction nearby, an economy based off stoneworking, and to top it off, serving as a new base for the Korean Navy, Ulsan is set to become a new economic center for the Korean Empire.\nNeighbouring Kaesong won‘t be too happy to hear about a new rival town stealing their trade of Korean Navy endorsement, though"

And with two nuclear missiles still stationed in Lashkar Gar, the Trungs insistence at using Drone UAVs over tried-and-true melee units will cost them dearly should they continue.\nBut ten units in Tarsus can only mean trouble for Sibir, and each one of those ten air units stationed there could be a nuclear missile waiting to be unleashed against the unsuspecting Sibir hordes..."

In a fresh breath of air, it looks like we‘re looking at a potentially game changing proposal, at last.\nShould this proposal be successful, we might see huge ramifications across the globe for major powers, from Sibir to Korea to Brazil.\nHowever, given the number of nuclear-weapon states on the planet, I‘m not sure if it‘ll pass. Probably not.\nIn other news, a proposal to ban Silk is in motion. I suspect Kuchum Khan has something to do with it - with silk being a major commodity exported by Vietnam, a ban on its sale might cripple their economy.\nOr they just prefer wool. Wool is warm."
