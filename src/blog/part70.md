  narration: "Welcome to the Civilizations Battle Royale of part 70! Your narrator for today is me, /u/TA_Knight! We are currently at a focal point of wars as the the strongest civilization of the on, the Boers, was declared war on by multiple civilizations! Will the Alliance manage to defeat the Juggernaut, or will the Boers triumph above all else? Find out in this part!"

  narration: "The annals of the world and city map by /u/Malssistra and /u/LacsiraxAriscal has been going severe changes as cities around the world fall and flip between all kinds of civilizations, some you wouldnt even expect to be there."

  narration: "The Buccaneers begin the new part with striking with their ships at West Africa, retaking Marrakech and Bamako. These who are watchful will note that Marrakech has the Great Lighthouse, an important wonder for naval warfare, so its important for the Buccaneers to hold it as long as possible."

  narration: "The Ethiopian offensive is thinning in every turn, as Ethiopia is pushed back from Fes in another failed siege against one of the Boer cities. It wont be long until Ethiopia has to go on the defensive on the northern front too."

  narration: "Addis Ababa flips! The Boers are rampaging though Ethiopia, taking Adwa and even flipping the Ethiopian capital. Along the wide front, all Ethiopian cities are in deep red and only need a melee unit to take them out. This might be a bit difficult due to Boers‘ bias toward Hover Tanks, but they have enough other unit types on the battle field to make up for it."

  narration: "The Alliance are really bringing down their nukes on Paul Kruger - However it doesnt seem to slow down the juggernaut much. The Buccaneers will need everything they will have in their arsenal if they dont want to lose all their holdings in Africa."

  narration: "On a more quiet front, Korea peaces out with Sibir, in a war that only served to waste Korean XCOMs and Sibir cities. Sibir still has to stay on battle stations, however, as they have stupidly declared war on the Boers, who are now attacking their eastern-most cities, like Finland and Korea before them."

  narration: "Despite the tiny size and weakness of Israel, they are still able to make effect on the diplomacy of the world, as they propose enacting Judaism as a world religion. Theres little chance for this to work, as not many civilizations are left in Europe, but who knows, maybe Judaism will prevail?"

  narration: "Respect the dead‘ is a phrase unheard of in the Battle Royale, as our dear leaders frequently plot against these without cities."

  narration: "We are in for a short commercial break for Rio Olympics 1640! The city of Rio counts 24 population units, which is impressive for an empire like Brazil, but less so for the technological leaders, and counts many wonders, one of which is the Alhambra, which provides rough terrain bonuses to units built in the city. This is less than useful in the current wars, however, as neither water or mountains are counted as rough terrain for some reason."
- scene_number: 12

  narration: "Rio‘s twin city, M‘banza-Kongo, on the other hand, counts 54 population units, so much there arent enough jobs for them to fill, despite the vast infrastructure of the city. This city is building Cybersubs, to aid in the defense against Brazilian and Buccaneer ships."

  narration: "Our spies spin the roulette again, this time assigning them to Sweden, Tibet, and for some reason the Inuit again. To be fair, the Inuit own like 12% of the cities in the world."
- scene_number: 14

  narration: "Back to another front, we see Honolulu under the control of the Blackfoot, in which several high tech ships are located, should another war between them and Mexico start. Interestingly, a few Chilean ships also reside here, instead of assisting in the war against Brazil. Maybe they were assigned to continue the legacy of Chile instead?"
- scene_number: 15

  narration: "Back to our scheduled programming, we see that Vietnam is still sending their army against the now Australian islands, in effort to retake their lost cities once again. Sadly, this effort is in vain, as Vietnam holds not a single melee unit in the entire area. All this serves is to prevent Australian attacks on the shore."
- scene_number: 16

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene16.jpg'
  narration: "At least they can comfort themselves in that they now hold India, after retaking it from Australia, and Australia cant do anything about it."
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "Holy damn. The Alliance grows, as the Inuit and Vietnam join in against the Boers! Neither own a good front against the Boers, but this does reveal the amount of hatred the world has against the Boers, the long time leader in power, who everyone else were but ants to him."
- scene_number: 18

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene18.jpg'
  narration: "Sibir still attempts to take out Afghanistan, but the mountains and the Finnish prove to be an annoying blockade. Afghanistan has rebuilt their carpet during the Vietnamese war, and Sibir has to chew though it once again, starting by bringing in new planes."
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "Sweden peaces out with the Boers, after successfully clearing the Boers from premises, though not without assistance. As Sweden was relatively unscathed in the wars, they have rebuilt well, unlike Finland who pretty much lost their carpet. If Sweden wants to take revenge, the time is now."
- scene_number: 20

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene20.jpg'
  narration: "Another war ending in Australia versus Vietnam! The long time war extending all the way from part 61 has ended, resulting in Vietnam gaining India, but Australia gaining the Philippine islands which they lost in the first war against Vietnam, also reconnecting Japan. The more important change in this war, however, is not their territories, but their army composition. Australia shed off their digger carpet, and are now building more advanced units like Mech Infantry units, while Vietnam went hard core ranged and is spawning a drone carpet. Only time will tell who will end up gaining an advantage should a third war between these start."
- scene_number: 21

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene21.jpg'
  narration: "Funnily enough, this image is very much alike the first Korean-Vietnamese war. Vietnam holding relatively low amount of units, mostly ranged, and Korea boasting a full, although small carpet. Could we see a replica war as well?"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene22.jpg'
  narration: "Ethiopia regains Adwa, but loses Harar and Zabid as the Boers simply strife though Ethiopian territory, all the way up to the red sea. Ethiopia is bringing in paratrooper reinforcements from Arabia as Ethiopia loses more and more, but this seems to have little effect."
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene23.jpg'
  narration: "The last Moroccan great prophet currently resides in Kongo Dia Nlaza, probably the only remaining Kongolese city not in Boer hands. They watch as Boer Hover Tanks swipe though Ethiopia, and think of what their future would be if Ethiopia collapses. Once they wanted to bring unity under the Ethiopian religion, but now unity is coming in the form of the Boers, and its not going to include them in the following utopia. It will be a unity though genocide."
- scene_number: 24

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene24.jpg'
  narration: "Brazil does it! They actually manage to capture a Boer city! Sure, they had to spend their entire attack squad to do this, but they can now gloat they managed to make the Dutchmen bleed."
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene25.jpg'
  narration: "‘If you can‘t have it, nuke it‘ is the Buccaneer password of the day, as Fes is nuked out of existence following a failed Ethiopian offensive. The Buccaneers are not ready to leave this world, and they are willing to bring the wrath of the entire world down on the Boers, just so they can keep their African holdings."
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene26.jpg'
  narration: "The Buccaneer navy is dying, as they are pushed back to Sale but its not going to make them stop nuking the Boers. Tagging along them is an Inuit Arsenal Ship, ready to cause some havoc over their main competitors."
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "Iceland saw the alarm bells back from the Scandinavian wars, and carpets their navy so they are no longer vulnerable from an attack by Sweden. The atomic bomb stack still remains in Galway, to deter any funny business coming from the east."
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene28.jpg'
  narration: "Just when Mexico thought that the Buccaneers will leave the war, they strike again and take Ciudad Juarez. The Buccaneers are not going to wait for Texas to be eliminated to attack Mexico, even if it means its harder to move their army forward."
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene29.jpg'
  narration: "Any resistance in Ethiopian West Africa is over, as not only Addis Ababa falls, but also Lalibela and even Kufah. Ethiopia barely has units left in the way, meaning that the Boer gains are limited by the amount of melee units now."
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene30.jpg'
  narration: "Mexico regains their capital, but the damage is already done as Australia takes Meridia and Texas takes back their capital using their very last melee unit.. again. This is an extreme amount of resistance from a civilization that was a rump state for over 20 parts."
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene31.jpg'
  narration: "Ethiopia regains some cities, but even their carpet back in Arabia seems to be exhausted. Ethiopia is down to their very last troops, but be sure they will mount a resistance."
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene32.jpg'
  narration: "The western front has less Boer units, but its no less dire. Ethiopia can rest in peace now, as they finally managed to take a city from their enemy, Dire Dawa, without any external assistance. Although i think this city was originally Ethiopian, lost eons ago."
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene33.jpg'
  narration: "The Buccaneers are ready to take Kumasi the moment Brazil loses hold of the city, backed by Inuit nuclear threats. This is all but a delay in the eyes of the Boers, but it wouldn‘t be the Buccaneers if not the most annoying fly in the face of their enemies."
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene34.jpg'
  narration: "The Ashanti Pikeman go south, away from the war front. They have already participated in one war, the one that resulted in the slaughter of all they knew of. And now, Ethiopia will get the same treatment."
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene35.jpg'
  narration: "It seems like Brazil has finally overcome their problems. They move embarked melee units around the mountains, and take Talca, and Arica is in zero health, with a Brazilian paratrooper in range for capture. This may be the last turn for Chile."
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene36.jpg'
  narration: "The Buccaneers bring in reinforcements from the Americas to assist in their African issue. The navy over at Africa has seen better days, and will not hold forever at this state."
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene37.jpg'
  narration: "In case you forgot, here is a largely forgotten war, Mongolia and Sibir versus Yakutia. Both wars can be summed as throwing stones over each other‘s heads, though a bit more technologically advanced."
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene38.jpg'
  narration: "Despite the extended war Brazil had against Chile, Brazil lost little of their carpet, and are fully ready should a war against the Buccaneers ignite. The Buccaneers, on the other hand, are completely unprepared. If Brazil or the Inuit join against the Buccaneers, their days are limited."
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene39.jpg'
  narration: "Yet another nuke hits the Boers, this time at Lonago. More interesting, though, is the clear lack of nukes at the Ethiopian front. It seems like Ethiopia is not using their nukes at all, and neither do the Boers."
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene40.jpg'
  narration: "The Vietnamese lure their enemies closer, as 3 Boer ships approach an “undefended” Kalumnai. While the Vietnamese air force is likely to make short work of the Boer ships, Vietnam has little melee units to spare should a city flip. Is this all part of a ruse though?"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene41.jpg'
  narration: "Finland does what Finland does, and citadels Espoo, the city they lost in the war against Sweden. Finland is likely torn between wanting their city back, especially since its right on the other side of Helsinki, and letting Sweden keep it under the agenda of border gore. Tough choice."
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene42.jpg'
  narration: "For the first time in this war we receive a full shot of Ethiopian Arabia. Ethiopia doesn‘t look any powerful now any more, with more Boer units in Ethiopian territory than Ethiopia themselves."
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene43.jpg'
  narration: "As expected, Kumasi falls, but the Buccaneers don‘t manage to retake the city, partly thanks to Brazil screwing up their formation. Everyone wants Kumasi these days, even the Inuit."
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene44.jpg'
  narration: "As is the tradition for the AI, Sweden, instead of plotting against anything meaningful, plots against Arabia. It wouldn‘t be Civilizations 5 without this AI."
- scene_number: 45
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene45.jpg'
  narration: "Nedong will likely look like a nuclear hellhole for a long time until Tibet is able to churn out a worker to assist in rebuilding the destroyed lands of Kiev. For now, though, Tibet is looking to pick on one of the only civilizations weaker than them, Timur. They dont even have any cities? Screw that, lets prove our power!"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene46.jpg'
  narration: "City information shows that only 2 tiles are covered with fallout, so Tibet has the chance to grow here. Unfortunately, none of the improvements they have access to actually provides food. Sadly, this city will not grow and prosper."
- scene_number: 47
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene47.jpg'
  narration: "Thanks to the peace made between Vietnam and Australia, a number of Vietnamese units have been dislodged away from their task and ended up in Hawaii, away from their friends and families. Not all benefited out of this peace deal, it seems."
- scene_number: 48
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene48.jpg'
  narration: "Kimberley has been lying, waiting to show off their power once again. They may have been beaten, slaughtered, banished out of their homeland, but they are still standing. Who will suffer Kimberley‘s wrath?"
- scene_number: 49

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene49.jpg'
  narration: "AND BRAZIL DOES IT! Chile is eliminated at 27th place, finally breaking the chain of parts without elimination.\n \nChile has always been a relatively silent civilization, as South America was pretty much inactive for the longest while. Only once Brazil took out Argentina hell broke loose, leading to various wars such as Chile warring against the Inca and Brazil, but ultimately they didnt manage to get much. Chile then did the impossible by attacking Hawaii, taking cities far away with only a few ships, and even sniped and killed America (the 2nd)! The respectful empire of 20 cities did not last long, as Australia, the Inuit and the Buccaneers attacked Chile, taking all their colonies and limiting them to their very home land. Despite so, Chile stood a long time under constant Australian, Buccaneer and Brazilian assaults until they finally got eliminated by Brazil, but not before humiliating them."

  narration: "At the end of the last part, the Inuit have landed a few XCOMs on Yakutian territory, but it appears that this attack has failed. Back to stagnated war front, then."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene51.jpg'
  narration: "Former Timur, once a desert, is now covered with Hydroponic farm, providing food to all its citizens. What was once a wasteland is now a prospering urban sprawl."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene52.jpg'
  narration: "An exiled Canadian destroyer somehow gets lodged between Iceland and Sweden. Not a great place to be found in as the two sides militarize rapidly."
- scene_number: 53
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part70-scene53.jpg'
  narration: "The Buccaneers take Kumasi, and even set their eyes on Messina. The Boer navy is nowhere to be seen, it seems that the Boers think that the Buccaneers are so weak, they dont need naval units at all to win against them. Im not sure if its an insult or arrogance.\nWe end the Battle Royale here, no Info Addict this part sadly, however remember the next part coming in Wednesday! this is /u/TA_Knight wishing you all a peacekeeped night!"
