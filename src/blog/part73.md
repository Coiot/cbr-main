  narration: "Hello, and welcome back to the Civ V Battle Royale!  I’m your narrator today, /u/The_EnigmaConundrum.  Big thanks to TPang for letting me do this short-notice part.  Now, let’s get right into the recap!"

  narration: "The power rankings this time show that the Inuit have the number 1 slot in their cold, dead hands, and have tightened their grip to be colder and… deader.  We’ll see if they hold this position, or if it’s temporary."

  narration: "Here is the map from last time, notably showing the flip of some Boer holdings, as well as the Inuit advance into Yakutia.  Carthage has been lost to Iceland, Kumasi to the Buccaneers, and the Ice Man Cometh into Yakutia."

  narration: "Here, we have a population density map from part 72!  Noticeably, population is very low in West and North Africa, most likely due to the sheer amount of city flips.  On the same continent happen to be the highest population cities, naturally including M’banza-Kongo.  Most of eastern Finland and western Sibir are still recovering their populations from their war a few parts ago, and Mexico has lost most of its population from Australia and the Buccs. Now, onto the relationships chart!"

  narration: "Here we see the remaining members of the OCP, containing Iceland, Brazil, Vietnam, and Ethiopia still at war with the Boers.  We also see the Anti-Japan Coalition, with the members that can do nothing in the war, and the Kimberley.  Some other miscellaneous wars, like Armenia vs Israel, and Sweden is still trying to take Dvin.  Hasn’t SirMallock suffered enough?"

  narration: "Here we see a shot of Messina and Loango, one Boer island city and another a formerly Kongolese city.  These two cities are surrounded by embarked Boers, or Boer units.  They are closer to the Boer core, so they’re probably going to stay orange."
- scene_number: 07

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene07.jpg'
  narration: "Now, here is Harrismith, another Boer settlement!  Being a one tile island, it isn’t highly sought after by any of the Boer’s current enemies.  It still has a Hovertank, Historical Caravel and some of the Boer fleet surrounding it, however."
- scene_number: 08

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene08.jpg'
  narration: "Here we get a shot of what’s left of Etharabia.  Notably, the Boers now own Mecca, putting another capital under their control.  Bethlehem, Damascus, and Najran are all in the red, so they could flip soon.If you look to the north, Gaza is in the yellow, spelling trouble for David."
- scene_number: 09

  narration: "Brazil has made peace with the Boers!  Only briefly flipping a city, they weren’t much use in this war, but they did more than Sibir.  Vietnam seems to be somewhat inactive against the Boers, leaving this war mainly to the Buccs and Iceland.\nWith this peace treaty we also have a nice shot of the Brazilian core, which is well defended by their carpet, also happening to be one of the mostly intact carpets (looking at you Kruger, Kekkonen, Kuchum)."

  narration: "My F key is now primed, as Gaza is in the yellow, and has three Armenian paratroopers next to it, as well as Tiridates’ reinforcements a little bit north of Gaza.  We may witness Israel’s second death soon."

  narration: "Genghis is trying to take Khonuu for Mongolia, but with little luck.  He’s using helicopters on cities, which doesn’t work.  The Horribly Slow Conqueror with an Extremely Inefficient Army needs another type of unit."
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene12.jpg'
  narration: "The Finnish core is somewhat sparse, lacking a large amount of units.  I guess when you’re not at war with anyone you can go relax in the sauna instead of carpeting."
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene13.jpg'
  narration: "The Inuit definitely have the upper hand here, having flipped two border cities and having XCOMs and GDRs ready to fight the Yakuts.  Time will only tell if they continue to take cities."
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene14.jpg'
  narration: "Genghis has gotten a modern armor next to Khonuu!  Mongolia can now capture the city from Darkhan, if the modern armor doesn’t get killed first.  We will see."
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene15.jpg'
  narration: "A shot of the Siberian core shows them to have almost no carpet!  Fun fact: there are more workers than units here.  Carpeting 101 here.  Always have less units defending than you do civilians."
- scene_number: 16

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene16.jpg'
  narration: "The Buccaneers make more gains as they take Nuevitas and Carthago Nova.  They may revive part of Arrrrrrrrrrrrfrica, but not the whole thing.  That much land it lost to the Boerg now."
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "It’s happened everybody.  Israel is dead.  Starting in a crowded region, with the Ayyubids, Arabia, and Armenia, David didn’t have much of a chance to expand.  They died about 30 parts ago, and being revived in part 63 with an awful city left them in an awful position, and Ethiopia citadeling them didn’t help.  They did found the religion most of Europe and part of Central Asia follows though, so that’s a plus for them."
- scene_number: 18

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene18.jpg'
  narration: "We can see the last two Jewish missionaries, and a defended inquisitor in Etharabia.  The missionaries will likely will spread Judaism and fade, but the inquisitor can’t be used.  If he does get used, which he is unable to be used, then we’re in for a shock, because Israel was then revived.  Nobody expects the Jewish inquisition!"
- scene_number: 19

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "Okay, the Boerg are angry.  They have two nukes right outside Kumasi, and may use them.  You can hear their army chanting “YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED” at the pirates, all the way from Dvin.  Resistance is indeed futile."
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene20.jpg'
  narration: "A second slide showing Kumasi, but without any display there.  It doesn’t look good, especially with a nuclear threat outside of it.  With a small amount of land surrounding it that isn‘t Boer, it won‘t be very useful to the Buccs, if it weren‘t a capital.  The old Ashanti land is one of the things that made this a worthwhile capture."
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene21.jpg'
  narration: "The Korean core has less units, but high-tech units.  They have Robot Infantry next to Jokusai, and Finnish PEACEKEEPERS (definitely not ready to snipe a city) near Hiroshima, ready to make more bordergore."
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene22.jpg'
  narration: "The Boer core has a large navy near it, and many paratroopers needing an upgrade, as well as a Great Musician.  What would Boer music sound like?  Being basically cyborgs at this point, would dubstep be almost like classical to them?  An older form of music using earlier versions of the same tools?"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene23.jpg'
  narration: "Here we see Iceland’s core, with an armada full of empty carriers and cybersubs.  Is that a Swedish privateer?  Seriously Gustavus, you need to upgrade!  Any major power could beat that!  The AI always has a massive stash of gold.  Well, here’s somewhere to use it."

  narration: "In this image taken from a low-budget Buccaneer Biodrone (made from Boer scraps, a polaroid camera and ducttape) The Boers are sending a GDR to take Basse-Terre back from Henry Morgan.  The Buccs will probably take it back.  It’s just been like Straya-Vietnam with lots of flips with no large changes in the end.  Also, in the bottom-left corner, you can see the comms within the Babylonian submarine.  Two hours to what?  The arrival of the Shooting Star?"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene26.jpg'
  narration: "Yakutia has taken Russkoye Ustye from Ekeuhnick!  Trigger Darkhan is going to rap to commemorate his victory.  Hopefully he finishes it before the Inuit take it back.  But then he can reuse it when the Yakuts probably flip it again."
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "Genghis has done it!  He took Khonuu!  That one modern armor made it and now it is his!  The Horribly Slow Conqueror just made a gain!  Happy times for all of Mongolia.  I guess that‘s why you don‘t fight the Mongols when you have a Great Wall.  Even if it is obsolete, they still always get through it."
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene28.jpg'
  narration: "Here are the ruins of a city, which belongs to Finland now, and only that tile.  It’s miniature bordergore!  Kekkonen can’t even stop the bordergore when he tries.  Also, the Siberian Worker Battalion and the Finnish Worker Corps seem to be ready to fight.  Which Civ can build enough roads in each other’s territory to try and screw their economy?"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene29.jpg'
  narration: "Holy crap that’s a lot of nukes.  Iceland seems to be serious about winning against the Boers.  Nukes won’t do much to the already incredibly irradiated Boer lands, but he can try."
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene30.jpg'
  narration: "In Cork, Ingolfur has jet fighters instead of nukes, but still enough of an air force to damage some Boer cities.  Maybe Iceland will hold more than Carthage and Olympia now.  Maybe."
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene31.jpg'
  narration: "Another wing of the Icelandic Nuclear force is in Lyon, much closer to the Boers.  This and the Reykjavik nukes could put a serious dent in the northern Boer holdings.  Iceland is hoarding nukes like the Indian nuclear warlord we all know of from this game series (not the BR) who I will not name."
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene32.jpg'
  narration: "The Boers took Nuevitas back and his army is approaching the Bucc cities in the red, including Rabat, Marrakech, Basse-Terre, Ciudad Del Carmen, and Bamako.  These cities could easily be flipped by the CyberBoers if Kruger put in more of an effort."
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene33.jpg'
  narration: "The unexpected inquisitor is seeking sanctuary in Jericho.  Good choice David.  Every other Ethiopian city is in the red but Jericho is undamaged.  He may be safe there.  Or the Boers will march around it for a few days, playing the aforementioned futuristic dubstep until the walls fall."
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene34.jpg'
  narration: "Now we see that Sibir has units close enough to take Kabul, Afghanistan should be worried.  Once Kabul is Siberian, it’s a perfect doorway into the rest of Afghanistan.  This could be all Kuchum needs to defeat Hotak."
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene35.jpg'
  narration: "The Boers have reclaimed Utique and Carthago Nova from Morgan!  This is a small push on the Buccs.  Gades is also soon to fall, and with MARINES (Great job Buccs, way to stay on top of the tech game), they aren’t likely to take either city back."
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene36.jpg'
  narration: "A Mobile SAM is now embarked to take Sale from the Buccaneers.  A Hovertank has weakened the city, but the Mobile SAM could take it.  Let’s see if this happens soon."
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene37.jpg'
  narration: "The Yakuts have a rocket artillery weakening their old city of Khonuu.  It’s in the red so we could see a flip yet again.  In other words, not much happening except population getting lowered."
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene38.jpg'
  narration: "Here is the strategic view of the Northern part of Sibir, Mongolia, and Yakutia.  Yakutia has the most fallout, with Mongolia in second, and Sibir doing the best on having clear land.  Just nuclear fallout everywhere in the Russian tundra."
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene39.jpg'
  narration: "Here we see the incredibly nuked Yakutian-Inuit border.  It seems that the Inuit did use that nuclear missile we saw earlier.  The first of many, it seems."
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene40.jpg'
  narration: "The Moroccan musketman is heading for Vietnam, after too much time trapped with the Boers.  Maybe they’ll get trapped in the Vietnamese carpet as opposed to Kruger’s carpet."
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene41.jpg'
  narration: "Khonuu has been flipped back to brown and blue.  Genghis has still made no headway here, so he’s back to being the Horribly Slow Conqueror.  He did seem to lose the helicopters for cities, so that’s a plus."
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene42.jpg'
  narration: "The single Kimberley missile cruiser near Osaka is nearly dead.  I guess Jandamarra won’t kill Meiji yet.  Korea’s favorite animes won’t get cancelled just yet.  There was much rejoicing in Seoul."
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene43.jpg'
  narration: "Kimberley Indonesia has enough of a navy to take Osaka if they want to, so why aren’t they?  The AI at its best, folks.  Carpeting over fighting."
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene44.jpg'
  narration: "Iceland has a Stealth Bomber in Sparta.  Sparta also has zero health, all that is needed is any Boer unit nearby.  Unfortunately, there’s absolutely no Boer units nearby."
- scene_number: 45
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene45.jpg'
  narration: "Here’s strategic view, showing the almost-dead Osaka, in the red.  There’s also a backup Kimberley missile cruiser, highlighted by TPang.  Even if the first one dies, Jandamarra can still finish off Japan."
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene46.jpg'
  narration: "It seems Russkoye Ustye has flipped back to being Inuit.  Darkhan is no longer rapping, but he something much more solemn for this loss.\nIs this the real life…\nIs this just fantasy…\nCaught in a warzone…\nEscape from Russkoye Ustye...\nHowever, Ekeuhnick needs to step up his game to make more advances into Yakutia.  Brazil’s peacekeepers are also getting in the way, so Pedro is partially causing such a stagnant war."
- scene_number: 47
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene47.jpg'
  narration: "Here’s a reflipped Khonuu, back to Genghis, with more helicopters, of course!  He just can’t stop trying to capture cities with units unable to capture cities.  A Mobile SAM did the job though, so it doesn’t matter."
- scene_number: 48
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene48.jpg'
  narration: "Our first major shot of Mexico, or basically Fallout 5 at this point.  They’ve both been nuked enough to count.  Ciudad Juarez  and Monterrey are in the red, making them easy targets for Buccs and Strayans alike."
- scene_number: 49
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene49.jpg'
  narration: "The Boers seem to have 4 drone fighters within proximity of Olympia and Gades.  Maybe that’s why the cities are always so low on health.  Hippo Regius has no health and an Icelandic unit nearby, ready to claim their first inland African city."
- scene_number: 50
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene50.jpg'
  narration: "Carthago Nova and Nuevitas have both flipped back to black.  The Buccs have reclaimed the two frequently flipping cities.  By Kruger’s turn, they’ll probably flip back again based on the way this part has been."
- scene_number: 51
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene51.jpg'
  narration: "Here is the victory progress menu!  All other victories are disabled, obviously, but the domination progress is quite complex.  However, Iceland is the current winner, controlling 7 capitals.  We will see how the Boer wars here change this, as Kruger controls multiple capitals.  M’Banza-Kongo, Mecca, Nyeni, Ulundi, Cairo, and Pretoria are all somewhat possible captures by Iceland, Vietnam, and the Buccaneers."
- scene_number: 52
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene52.jpg'
  narration: "Another shot of the Boerg Armada, stationed near Umgungundlovu and Nongoma, mostly.  Also here is a very lost member of the Wobbegong, as well as the Persian Privateer.  Maybe Kruger will trap him, wanting a replacement Ashanti pikeman.  Nothing can replace Osei, but the Boers can try."
- scene_number: 53
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene53.jpg'
  narration: "I didn’t mention this earlier because of the death of Israel, but Ekeuhnick is plotting against the Persian Privateer.  He’d have to go a long way and through the Boermuda Triangle known as the Boerg Armada.  That’d be about as useful as the Boers killing the Last Legion, as listed here.  The only thing of note here is a possible Boer-Mongol war."
- scene_number: 54

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene54.jpg'
  narration: "The grand spymaster TPangolin shuffles his spies, with Em in Kandahar, Ishtar in Osaka, and Semiramis in Ciudad Juarez.  I feel that at least one of them will be fleeing their city soon."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene55.jpg'
  narration: "Henry Morgan tires of the sea and builds a vertol!  This could be a problem for Benito, as Vertols have 80 attack strength and also happens to be faster.  It is a helicopter unit, so no city captures, but it is a little stronger."
- scene_number: 56
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene56.jpg'
  narration: "Iceland also has Railgun Armor in Boer lands!  Only slightly stronger than Modern Armor, however, it’s easily positioned to take either Hippo Regius or Kongo Dia Nlaza."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene57.jpg'
  narration: "The unexpected inquisitor is wandering towards Gaza, hoping to maybe take it back with the crossbows.  That isn’t how it works David, don’t try.  Stay in Jericho.  It’s much safer there."
- scene_number: 58
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene58.jpg'
  narration: "With no flips in this area, the thing of note is the UN meeting in 5 turns.  They’re trying to pass Judaism as a World Religion and an embargo on the Mongols.  I don’t think the former will pass, but I doubt anyone in, say, the Americas, really cares about the Mongols."

  narration: "Damascus was just nuked off the map, apparently.  Ah well.  Najran looks likely to fall soon, especially with a Boer GDR nearby.  This only leaves Etharabia with Jericho, partially surrounded with Hawaiian peacekeepers.  Also, is that a Hawaiian marine I see near Najran?  WIll they snipe a city?"
- scene_number: 60

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene60.jpg'
  narration: "Here is the strategic view shot of the same region, with the fallout surrounding the land that used to be Damascus.  Baalbek and Cairo seem to have also been hit pretty hard by nukes, showing the Boers have quite the recovery stage coming."

  narration: "Here is a shot of Strayan Philippines, with the Kimberley military passing through.  I may have to eat my words on the last slide, as Jandamarra is sending his real army through to attack.  This may be worse for Japan than Yakutia’s brief Khanquest of Osaka."

  narration: "Nedong is doing somewhat well, at a population of 4, with Siberian workers, Armenian infantry, two cannons, and a Finnish caravan passing through.  Unless Tiri wants more land from fellow rump states, this should be relatively fine."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene64.jpg'
  narration: "IF THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT LEG DAY, THEN THEY WILL NOT LIVE!  Seriously though, Sparta can build nukes now.  We may get another blaze of glory like Texas or the Maori.  Weapons other than the abwall soldiers will bode quite well for Leonidas."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene65.jpg'
  narration: "Here’s the Yakut-Sibir border, and oh god.  Are those ARTILLERY I see around Turinsk?  Seriously Kuchum, you’re nearly as bad as the Boers on upgrading!  That’s just awful.  Industrial era weapons don’t work with Future Worlds weapons."

  narration: "The Bucc naval carpet is quite solid, with TPang highlighting that they have Mutants!  Also, next to the Mutant is a Great merchant.  Henry Morgan seems to be trying to bring back Bring Your Merchant to War Day from the beginning of Mk II."

  narration: "A Boer nuke is close enough to nuke the Bucc fleet, slowing them down, possibly allowing the Boers to retake these cities.  However, there are a couple of Icelandic ships to the south of the Bucc fleet, acting as backup."

  narration: "Iceland seems to have a solid hold on Olympia, they’ll probably hold it.  Carthago Nova is low on health, meaning it could flip soon, especially with a Boer GDR nearby it."

  narration: "Carthago Nova and Utique are in the black, and not a Boer melee unit in sight!  I’d focus on that, but the Roman Bucc holding are being damaged, but probably will not be taken, as well as Sparta.  It seems there are more workers than there are Boer units that can capture cities here."

  narration: "Jericho is now in the black, and the Boers have a Chimera next to it.  Etharabia may fall soon, or it may not.  As far as we know, Najran is still alive, so Selassie is still safe."

  narration: "The Boers have Rabat and Nuevitas back, and Bamako is in the black, also without any unit capable of taking cities.  Great job Kruger, you are a good strategist.  Nope, this is horrible."

  narration: "Kruger had himself flown out to Harrismith, just to say goodbye to Osei Tutu one last time.  The pikeman is leaving Africa to explore the world.  Apparently the Ashanti have Astronomy, as they are leaving.  Maybe they will meet the Burmese musician soon.  Maybe they will find a new land, greater than ever.  Either way, all of the Boers are sad to see their medieval friends go."

  narration: "Here are two Inuit nukes near Kamchatka.  Presumably going to aid the Yakut border conflict, these bombs will further irradiate the already inhospitable lands.  It’s like if Hiroshima and Chernobyl had a massive child."

  narration: "Here we get a shot of the Bucc-Brazil border, with the incredibly sparse Bucc lands, and the heavily carpeted Brazilian land.  Pedro could unify South America if he chose to, but due to diplomatic modifiers from the OCP, this wouldn’t happen right now.  Shame.  I was almost ready to see the GCP shitposts."

  narration: "A capital has been lost.  Before anyone posts about “which capital was lost,” I checked the minimap, and it was Kabul.  Sibir has taken Kabul.  I fear Afghanistan will fall shortly after this, as this is a gateway into the rest of the “graveyard of Empires” (not Dvin, the other one). \nAlso, the Boer lands are irradiated  beyond hope at this point.  Even if they had a worker carpet to rival Sibir, it’d still take forever to restore their population."

  narration: "Etharabia has really buffed up its defenses of Najran, so even if they lose Jericho, they still have one city that could hold out for a turn or two.  Only time will tell."

  narration: "Another slide on Mongolia and Yakutia!  With Khonuu somewhat in his grasp, Genghis will keep one city from this part at least.  He also seems to be going on the offensive to attack Darkhan."

  narration: "Here’s a shot of Borkholm, apparently with drone fighters and mech artillery.  There’s a small delegation from the Swedish Armada here, ready to fight.  They won’t fight for a little while, as they’d have to go all the way to Dvin, through the hellzone that is the Buccaneer Mediterranean and Boer north Africa.  For now, they stay near Helsinki, bothering Top Kek."

  narration: "InfoAddict slides!  Australia is number one in military, surpassing Vietnam by a decently large amount.  Iceland has the Boers beat at number 4, and the Buccs are out of the top ten, placing at 11."

  narration: "Australia is still number one in land area, because they haven’t had any major gains or losses in a while.  The Boers follow at number two with only two-thirds the amount Straya has.  It’s close from there, with the Inuit about the same size, with the Buccs disproportionately lower, and it keeps going from there."

  narration: "The Inuit still lead in the city count, closely followed by Australia.  The Boers are catching them however, with 93 cities.  Australia has 103 and the Inuit 105, so someone is catching up to the leaders of the city number board for a long time."

  narration: "The low side of the city count is Mongolia, with 13 cities.  After that is the Kimberley and Mexico with 10, and from there is our rump states!  Sri Lanka has 4, Armenia 3 (RIP Israel), Tibet 2, Ethiopia 2, Afghanistan 2, and Texas, Japan, Dvin, and Hawaii at 1 city."

  narration: "Iceland leads in Great Works by almost double of Australia, the number two here.  With 30 as opposed to 18 by Straya, Iceland is truly the artistic epicenter of the Cylinder."

  narration: "Within religions, Catholicism has 196 cities, leaving them as the leaders.  Judaism is 49 cities lower at 147, Oriental Orthodoxy still mostly belongs to Africa with 103 followers, and the numbers just keep going down until Islam, with 6 followers in the whole world.  The Party Prophet is more legend to the inhabitants of this world, having been long dead from liver failure.  Few still follow his teachings."

  narration: "We end things off with the religion map, showing the same thing as usual, but with one twist- religion is getting nuked and flipped out of some cities, notably ex-Arrrrrrrrfrican cities and some Asian cities.\nThis has been an interesting part, and we hope that all of you enjoyed it.  This has been /u/The_EnigmaConundrum and I wish you all a great day!"
