  narration: "Hello everyone, and welcome back to the Civ Battle Royale Mark 2! We are now at part 69 (hehehe), and I am your narrator, /u/LeUmoq! I am narrating this part blindly, so I have no idea what‘s going to come in this part. Last part we saw the Boers decimating the Buccaneer-held parts of Africa, Vietnam grinding against Sibir and Australia, Finland trading land with Sweden and Sibir, and Sweden reconquering their lands from the Boers. If this part is even half as exciting as the previous one, then we are in for an hell of a ride!"

  narration: "Just like most of the game, the Boers top the Power Rankings, due to their immense strength in military, as well as a tech lead only matched by the Inuit and Korea. In the previous parts, they also woke up from their slumber, and have beaten down on Sparta, Sweden and the Buccaneers, although they have been losing momentum in Europe, and have lost a few cities to Sweden. They are indisputably the most powerful nation on the entire cilinder."

  narration: "Here you can see the beautiful city map, made by some of our resident cartographers, /u/Malssistra and /u/LacsiraxAriscal! If you look at the map, you can easily see the conquests by the Boers in Arrfrica, and Brazil conquering the some of the last parts of Chile. However, if you look closer, you can see that Tibet has founded a second city in the ruins of the recently destroyed city of Kiev, which officially confirms that Tibet is no longer a city-state! They are however still very small, and will most likely lose their new city to the Sibir, who they are at war with. With that said, let‘s jump right into the action!"

  narration: "Well, you can immediately ignore what I just said about Tibet losing their second city to Sibir, since Tibet just peaced out with Sibir! That means that Tibet will most likely stop being a city-state for at least some time. The gods of bordergore are pleased with this outcome. You can also see that Vietnam made peace with Kuchum Khan [Sibir], ending one half of the meat-grinder on their border."

  narration: "On the now peaceful border between Vietnam and Sibir, Sibir has reconquered Bamda from their Korean overlords. However, the city will most likely not stay Sibirian for long, as Sejong [Korea], still has 3 XCOM Squads nearby the city, all of them basically at full health, while Sibir has a much weaker army of Paratroopers and Powered Armor Infantry. You can also see the massive difference between the Vietnamese and Korean lands, and the Sibir lands. While Vietnam and Korea have almost completely carpeted their lands with soldiers, the Sibirian army is scattered around their lands, and not really present around Bamda and Wuppertal."

  narration: "It seems like the Trungs (Vietnam) chose to make peace bit too early, seeing as all Sibir cities on their border are at yellow health at most. If they stayed in this war a little longer, they could‘ve most likely conquered some of those cities. This does mean that the Korean XCOMs and the Afghan Paratroopers can conquer the almost destroyed cities with relative ease. It also seems like Sibir has big army around here, but if you look closer, a lot of it is workers, and outdated Tanks and Artillery. All by all, Kuchum [Sibir] is in quite a predicament in the south of his empire."

  narration: "In the Middle-East, Artashat, Kuchum‘s [Sibir] last city in the region has almost no HP. It will however most likely not be conquered anytime soon, as the Ethiopian peacekeepers occupy every last tile surrounding Artashat, Gyumri and Gaza. If one one of the peacekeepers next to Artashat moves out of the way, then the city can be conquered by Afghan paratroopers, but the city will not switch hands for now. Also, some cities in Vietnamese Persia are damaged, and the land isn‘t carpeted, so if Ethiopia attacks right now, they might grab some cities from Vietnam."

  narration: "Meanwhile, in America, Sam Houston [Texas] reconquers their capital, Austin, with their second to last melee unit. It is almost certain that they will lose it to Mexico again very soon. This does mean that this turn 2 former city-states lost their city-state status, namely Tibet and Texas, and only Japan, Hawaii and Sparta being left. Guadalajara is also conquered by the Buccaneers, and it doesn‘t seem like it will be reconquered by Mexico anytime soon, seeing as the city is protected by mountains, and only has a small gap between them to the north. The Buccaneers do not have a visible army nearby, however, so the fate of the city is not certain yet."

  narration: "The Boers attacked Buccaneer West Africa last part, and have quickly blitzed the area. However, they will most likely have trouble with keeping the coastal city, due to the giant fleet made by Henry Morgan [Buccaneers]. The Buccaneers have also stationed a Nuclear Missile in the island city Cumana, ready to nuke the Boers. This won‘t be the first time that Henry Morgan [Buccaneers] ordered a nuclear bombing of West Africa, as he also completely irradiated the now Boer lands of Mali."

  narration: "In strategic mode, you can see the fallout made as a result of nuclear bombings better. That means that you can see the complete destruction of Central en Eastern Europe. From Messene to Krakow, and from Antioch to Zibo, almost all lands are covered in nuclear fallout. Also, if you look very closely, the last Roman Ballista can be spotted in the Sibir lands nearby Morelia, unscathed by the nuclear explosions surrounding it."

  narration: "In the middle of the nuclear almost-apocalypse, a small spot of light can be spotted. The small defensive state of Tibet has founded a city nearby the old Soviet city of Kiev, which was completely destroyed by nuclear bombings. This city has futuristic infrastructure, left behind by the Finns, but the Tibetans insist on using their Cannon from the Renaissance to defend the city, as is tradition."

  narration: "Buccaneer Iberia is mostly unscathed by the war going on just south of it, except Braga and Goa losing health. The region is almost completely empty however, except for airplanes in the south, most likely bombing the Boer‘s lands and units. If the Boers decide to attack it, it will most likely be conquered in a matter of turns, but for now, the Boers are content with just scouting the area with a Hovertank to see if there any hidden units anywhere. (Hint: there aren‘t)"

  narration: "Pedro [Brazil] has almost completely conquered Chile. Al that is left are Arica and Talca in southern Patigonia, protected by the Andes, and Iquique on the South Georgia Islands, west of Copiapo. All Brazil needs to do send a melee unit to the other city of the mountain range, and both cities are ripe for the taking. This may very well be the last part for Bernardo O‘Higgins [Chile]."

  narration: "In Inuit Kamchatka, the war with Yakutia is still heavily visible. Almost the entire peninsula is covered in fallout, and both Igloolik and Saniraiak are in the red. The Yakutians have no units nearby, so they will stay Inuit for now. The Inuits also have six Stealth Bombers stationed nearby the peninsula, so if some Yakutians do show up, they will be dealt with anyway."

  narration: "There is also a lot of fallout in the Australian lands. The former Kimberley lands of Rubibi and Kalumburu have been nuked, as well as Sulawesi and Western New Guinea. Vietnam is mostly unscathed in the region, but the Trungs [Vietnam] have lost My So‘n. Also of note, the Kimberly have militarized, having 5 planes and 5 missiles/nukes stationed in Simhapura. There are also planes in Makassar. Are they planning to join the war between Australia and Vietnam? Whatever side they join on, they will most likely be completely conquered and destroyed.\nIn the midst of Australian Waters a quarantine zone has been set up around the former remains of Laguna devastated by nuclear radiation."

  narration: "My prediction about Sibir losing cities to Korea and Afghanistan has come true! Nishapur has been conquered by an Afghan Paratrooper, and Jarlmadangah Burru (Good luck pronouncing that Dawkinzz) has been overtaken by a Korean XCOM-Squad. Samarqand, Herat and Rusadir are also all very weak, and if the Koreans or Afghans want to conquer more, those cities are the places to be. I would also like to have a moment to appreciate the comeback that Afghanistan is making. They truly are the Graveyard of Empires. (Unless that empire is Vietnam)"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part69-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "A look at the Korean core shows that Korea has not carpeted all that much. Most cities are surrounded by a ring of defensive troops, but a lot of the places between the cities are empty. This will most likely not be a problem, however, because Korea has stationed 8 Drone Fighters in Ambarchik, and probably some more in other cities. Most of these cities are close to the border with Yakutia, so it seems as if Korea is planning another attack on Tyghyn Darkhan [Yakutia]."

  narration: "Using their giant fleet, the Buccaneers have reconquered some of the coastal cities that the Boer menace had conquered. They also weakened some inland cities. The Boers will most likely take them back, but it seems as if their carpet is fading, as they only have troops on the borders with the Buccaneers, and one inland (as far as we can see). Is this a sign that the military dominance of the Orange Menace?"

  narration: "Besides their West-African holdings, the Buccaneers also conquer the previously Spartan city of Messene from the Boers. The Swedes cannot be happy with this, seeing as they were very close to reconquering it. Cumae is still undefended, and Gustavus [Sweden] can most likely take it."

  narration: "It is a sad day for Texas. The capital has been lost again, and the only melee unit left is almost dead and in Mexican borders. The last city is also almost destroyed. It seems as if the end for Texas is nearby. One thing is for sure, the Alamo will never be forgotten. The Buccaneers also keep Guadalajara, and are close to getting Ciudad Juárez. All by all, a good turn for the Buccaneers. There is also some VERY exciting news on the message screen, but I will save that for another slide.\nCiudad Juarez gets another rain of nuclear devastation. Dios mio."

  narration: "Semiranis finds out that the Inuit leader Ekeuhnick is planning an attack against Iceland. Most of these reports of planned attacks are false, so it is to be taken with a grain of salt, but if Ekeuhnick does decide to attack Iceland, then that means that Greenland will most likely be lost, if not the entirety of Iceland. Also, if Greenland is conquered, then the Ice Sheet fleet in the Arctic can finally escape, which means that the Inuit finally have one the world‘s largest navies at their disposal to wreak havoc around the world."

  narration: "The Buccaneers still have some Nuclear Missiles left to throw on the Boers, but that‘s most likely not the largest problem that the Boers have right now. I will stop keeping you waiting, and keep this slide short, so I can move on to the next slide. You‘ll see why."

  narration: "AND HERE IT IS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN! Some might call this the suicide of the century following the cylinder‘s rough history of seemingly innocuous against-all-odds wars. France vs Iceland and Byzantium vs Finland - has Ethiopia decided to end themselves via the Boers? On a more serious note, this declaration of war seems very stupid, as the Boers have been the dominating power over Africa, hell, even the world for the better part of the game, but if you look closer, you can see that something‘s missing, namely the army of the Boers!\nWest Africa seems almost completely void of Boer units, and with the Buccaneers fighting back hardily, the Boers are actually probably not able to completely steamroll Ethiopia. Also, Sweden is beating the Boers in Europe. Adding to that, Brazil and Sibir also declare war, both very strong nations with large armies and a huge amount of airpower. And if you remember, in the previous parts a HUGE Brazilian fleet was crossing the Atlantic. The Brazilian were made of because of that, but it was just part of a big plan to restrain the Boers. I would like to call this war/series of war “The Orange Containment Program.” On the North-Western front, Ethiopia definitely has the upper hand, together with the Buccaneers. Let‘s see if that‘s also the case on the other fronts of this massive war.\nDo not judge a book by it‘s cover."

  narration: "On the Eastern Front both Nations have their lands fully carpeted. However, the Boers are in a large tech-lead, so they have the upper hand on that part. Also important, Ethiopia has a large air-force at this front, including at least one Atomic Bomb. It is also important to remember Ethiopia‘s unique ability, which is that units have a +20% combat bonus when fighting units from a Civilization with more cities that Ethiopia, which is DEFINITELY the case in this war. But, even with all of these bonuses and seemingly advantages to Ethiopia, I still think that Boers will win this war, unless other Superpowers join."

  narration: "On the Indian Oceanic front, the situation is much more even. Both nation have a large fleet, but a large part of the Boer fleet consists of empty Carriers, very outdated Caravels and Hovertanks. I‘m sorry if I sound a bit biased against the Boers, but I just love it that these relatively small nations try to stand up against the definite Superpower of the cilinder, and I hope that they win this war, even though it most likely will not happen."

  narration: "The Ethiopians are not alone with attacking the Boers! From the Atlantic a Brazilian fleet approaches Boerfrica, is already heavily damaging Kumasi and Messina. It also seems as if the entire Boer navy is on the other side of Africa, as only a Hovertank can be seen here."

  narration: "The rest of the Brazilian navy is shown here, as well as the rest of the Boer navy. It‘s pretty obvious that the Boers will dominate this naval battle, but not before Brazil uses it‘s Atomic Bombs on the core of the Boers. Brazil will very likely be defeated by the Boers here, but not without putting up a hell of a fight."

  narration: "It seems as if the nuke was a waste, because only a few improvements are pillaged, the city is still in green health, and there doesn‘t seem to be a loss of units. All is good tactically in the grim calculus of wartime tactics until you realise that the blast caused the deaths of many millions and millions of people."

  narration: "A view of the strategic map shows the nuclear devastation in Boer West Africa. Some of this fallout has probably been here since the horrible nuking of Mali by the Buccaneers, but most of it is probably by the Buccaneers, Ethiopia and the Boers themselves. It is clear that whoever comes out on top in this, they will inherent a scorched earth."

His empire gives refuge to the last units of civs that have been defeated, like Hunnic Workers, A French Great War Infantry and a Galleass, and also a Timurid Galleass. Sparta just made peace with their faraway enemy Korea, making sure that they survive another day."

  narration: "Speaking about irradiated land, Mexico is completely broken in the south. All five cities pictured are in red health and surrounded by fallout and pillaged land. Austin especially is dangerously close to be captured, either by a Buccaneer Advanced Destroyer, or a Texan Great War Infantry. And if one of your cities is in danger of being captured by a Great War Infantry, then you know that you have a problem. The inland cities are pretty safe for now, but if the Buccaneers send some land-units, then Mexico should really be afraid."

This city has been gifted at the end of wars many times, and has been in the hands of the Ashanti, Morocco, Mali, Ethiopia and maybe Carthage (I‘m not quite sure). That has come to an end. The unconquerable city has been brutally conquered by the Boers, and it will stay in their hands in the foreseeable future."

They probably won‘t fall in the coming turn, but the Ethiopian defense can‘t last forever. It does seem as if the Boers have focussed completely on attacking the cities, as most Ethiopian units still have full health. Expect a lot of flipping in this region."

These ex-peacekeepers are now on their way to be huge menace to the Sibirian core, but also to Korea and Afghanistan, who are trying to conquer Sibir for themselves.

These Brazilian units were probably on their way to the Boer Antarctic colonies, but have been intercepted by the Boers. The Brazilians have a larger navy here, but it consists mostly of embarked units, so the Boers will probably sink their ships before the Antarctic colonies fall."

  narration: "When me and my siblings used to fight over toys when we were younger, my mom used to put the toy we were fighting over high on a shelve that we couldn‘t get to. That way we stopped fighting over stuff, because if we fought no one would get it. The same thing happened to the Boers and the Buccaneers. They fought over Tombouctu so much, that they literally nuked the city out of existence. No one has made any progress by doing this, and it just means that someone like Tibet can settle another city there. The Buccaneers however do reconquer Marrakech and Ciudad del Carmen."

  narration: "In the middle of this horrible and bloody war, one group of people doesn‘t suffer. The Ashanti Pikemen still travels the Boer lands as a sort of traveling circus. From far and wide, people come look at these people from another time, and the Pikemen don‘t mind. They get paid richly, and are national celebrities in the most powerful countries in the world. They do notice the war. They expected less people to come visit, but they are more popular now than ever. It seems as if people come see them to get away from this futuristic, inhumane war. They do have one disadvantage compared to before. Due to Ethiopia attacking the mighty Draka, Ethiopians residing in Boer lands are heavily discriminated against, and also can‘t visit the Ashanti Pikemen, but that doesn‘t even begin to outweigh the millions of people that already died in this war. Boers, Ethiopians, Soldiers, Civilians, they are all people."

A Buccaneer fleet is attacking Bamako, while the Brazilian fleet of former slide is moving in on the former Kongolese cities.

The Buccaneers are readying some land units near Guadalajara, most likely to go to Ciudad Juárez through the small gap in the mountains.

There was one stumbling block. Their previous city Kiev was destroyed, and they were planning on resettling it, but the area has been claimed by some ancient people from the Himalaya‘s. They could attack them, but when Sibir attacked Tibet, Vietnam came to the rescue of the mountain state, and Finland can‘t try to take that risk right after these two destructive wars."

In the east, the former American and Canadian cities are much less developed, with Boston and Montreal only having 2 population. Some Mexican and Australian units can be spotted walking around, gathering surveillance for their country. The leader of the Inuit, Ekeuhnick is planning on attacking Mirwais Hotak [Afghanistan]. Mirwais has had it bad enough for the last parts, but the Inuit are too far away to do anything in the war against Afghanistan, unless that‘s what the Missile Cruiser with the nukes a few slides before was for..."

Yakutia was once on the top spot to conquer the rest of the nations, but they were too pacifistic, and were eclipsed by other, more aggressive nations. It‘s a bit sad that they were recently beaten by Korea, the civ that was on the bottom spot of the Power Rankings once. A sad story indeed."

Canada is another sad story, much like Yakutia. Canada was also no. 1 in the Power Rankings for a short while. But unlike Yakutia, they weren‘t quiet. They attacked the Sioux and Texas, and were expanding for a long while, but their neighbour the Inuit fastly outgrew them, and defeated Canada in a series of crippling wars."

And I do spot a Boer Paratrooper on the outskirts of it. Is this the end for Addis Abeba?"

This was the Civ Battle Royale, narrated by /u/LeUmoq. Goodbye!"
