  narration: "Hello everybody and welcome back to the Civilization V Battle Royale Mk II! I‘m /u/Pylgrim, your MC for today by the grace of our wise overlord and submarine captain, TPang. Some of you may remember me for a series of analyses on the ever-dwindling frontiers of the unclaimed lands, back in  times that are now almost pre-history for this world. By now, every scrap of land has been claimed, populated and industrialised, nature has been subjugated, and more recently, even the atom has been split. And so, the only changing frontiers nowadays are those between warring nations, and what a spectacle it is!"

  narration: "Without further ado, we dive in. The Grand Inuit Glacier keeps its slow but unstoppable descent onto Texan lands. Corpus Christi has fallen and snow-covered helicopters keep the cities of Sisseton and Puebla on the red for the approaching land forces. In the meantime, the Canadians are managing to stall the glacier‘s advance even as Quebec city flips again. A nearby Maple-leaved force will be able to recapture it soon, no doubt."

  narration: "On the South American theatre, we see Henry Morgan‘s (Buccaneers) navy efficiently eroding the Incan coast line, making a mockery of the previously lauded Chilean Backdoor navy‘s power. On the Brazilian-Chilean war front, we see a war fought chiefly with planes, as several cities go into the red with minimal attrition from land forces. However, Bernardo O‘Higgins (Chile) manages to uses his navy to recapture the city of Catamarca while a Great War Infantry sneakily attempts an incursion into La Rioja, Argentina‘s former and last capital. A simple worker, head filled with dreams of heroic deeds, tags along."

  narration: "Let‘s not forget that Morgan and Pedro II (Brazil) are also at war. However, neither civ seems to be giving the conflict the relevance that we at the Bab-sub expected. A tiny convoy of Buccaneer ships (including a newly minted ironclad) makes a token effort at the Brazilian city of Manaus while the main corsair force remains in a drunken stupor at their Caribbean headquarters.  Pedro, now sporting submarines of his own, easily swats down the interlopers."

  narration: "Agent Semiramis, stationed at the Icelandic capital learns that Ingolfur Arnarson is plotting to erase the last trace of the once proud Ashanti empire, a humble Pikeman (Osei Tutu in disguise?) who‘s now making a peaceful living incognito as a fisherman within the Boer empire. This is such an unlikely development that puts Semiramis‘s reliability in doubt."

  narration: "While Pedro‘s massive army stands back and looks, Chile manages to recapture Neeuquen.  La Rioja also falls to that single GWI and his worker sidekick (who is trusted with the defence of the city as the infantry leaves to recruit more would-be heroes among the once Argentinian workers.) After a blindingly fast and successful campaign against Argentina, the Brazilian forces seem to have relapsed into their traditional incompetence, allowing the clearly outnumbered opponent to take the advantage."

  narration: "A glance at North America‘s heart confirms the expected. Quebec flips again, while the Inuit continue their relentless advance on Texas. But... what is this? It seems that in Sam Houston‘s (Texas) hour of need, an unlikely, yet invincible hero has heed the call! Chuck Norris himself joins the fray! My man Ekeuhnick (Inuit), you‘ve gone and done it now!"

  narration: "Now for a check up on the Oceanic War, not much seems to have changed (except city ownership, countlessly). Thank Nebby for the good people keeping track of city flips. I myself gave up long ago. On the sidebar we see yet more superpowers (Brazil and the Inuit) plotting to eradicate all traces of dying or dead empires (Japan and Rome) from the world. Similarly, Lester B Pearson (Canada), the host of the United Nations, squanders a proposal in screwing a small empire on the other side of the planet instead of using it to cripple his invading foe."

  narration: "The Maori join the Oceanic War!!!1!1! Oh wait... they‘re not declaring on next-door neighbour Australia as we‘ve been begging them to do, but on far-away Vietnam. *picardfacepalm* This, distressingly (for our bloodthirsty interests), suggests that Henry Parkes (Australia) and Te Rauparaha (Maori) are BFFs, or at least, drinking chums."

  narration: "Even though Vietnamese forces seem a bit thin now, they are being successful at recovering and holding their ex-Philippine islands and even at harrying some of Australia‘s ex-Japanese colonies. Seemingly having learned a painful lesson, this contingent sports some cavalry instead of their infamous Viet-cong units."
- scene_number: 13

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene13.jpg'
  narration: "Apparently inspired by the Te‘s DoW, Amawratha (Burma) declares on Vietnam. It seems suicidal at first blush, given Vietnam‘s proven ruthless efficiency and diplomatic savvy, and the wide technological gap between the two civs. However and surprisingly, Burma seems to have the denser unit carpet in the zone, after the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) have exhausted their own in their wars against Australia and the Champa. Even so, it‘s hard to get one‘s hopes up for Burma."

  narration: "Another war between neighbors! Oh wait, it‘s between the Mughals and Sri Lanka! Nothing to see here, people. These two have proven time and again to have a mere sibling rivalry that sparks an unexciting and lame slap fight every other century. I expect nothing different from this iteration.\nTPang‘s note: Lame Slap? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

  narration: "On the other hand, Sri Lanka‘s war with Arabia seems to be going somewhere. Even though they still lack actual units in the zone, their very respectable air force is keeping Arabia‘s desperadoes at bay while also whittling the nearby Arabian city of Najran down to zero. Hopefully, Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka) will send some city-taking reinforcements to the region soon!"

  narration: "Surprisingly, Henry Morgan is having a hard time holding his gains on the Incan coast! It seems that Pachacuti (Inca) is not going down without a fight. However, even though both his army and Morgan‘s navy seem similarly reduced at the moment, we know that Morgan has a massive batch of corsairs and ironclads lurking just out of sight, one screen North. Basically, Pachacuti‘s continued existence hangs solely on Morgan‘s whim (or rather, his state of drunkenness)."
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "In another of the now common dual DoWs, the Champa declares on the Mughal. Not that that is going anywhere what with the lack of open borders with Sri Lanka and the rather suspicious wave of Sri Lankan privateers just off the border. Nevertheless, Che Bong Nga (Champa) would do better focusing on his current war against the Trung Sisters, as Indrapura is taking heavy damage and My Son seems to follow. Speaking of the Trung Sisters, no action seems to have taken place between them and Burma yet. However, they have greatly increased their military presence in the region."
- scene_number: 18

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene18.jpg'
  narration: "The Incan Pacific holdings flip for the nth time, reducing them to shanty towns and filthy hovels. It won‘t be the last time, either, unless Morgan forces Pachacuti into a greatly disadvantageous truce."
- scene_number: 19

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "As our previous commenter rightly pointed, distance is no longer a relevant concern for advanced civilisations when making war, as Finland proves, grabbing Jericho from Arabia with paratroopers alone. However, it‘s still too early for these remote wars to be more than a proof of concept, as the unsupported city will be easily flipped in a turn.\nA bit to the left, we see Hannibal (Carthage) continuing his suddenly successful campaign on the Ayyubids, quickly halving Baalbek‘s HP bar, while a Great Musician looks on and weeps."

  narration: "After seeing his war against Leonidas (Sparta) slow down to a stall, Gustavus Adolphus (Sweeden) inconsequentially DoWs Vietnam, to pass the time. That one is too far away, even for paratroopers, to bother."
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene21.jpg'
  narration: "The Trung Sisters are amused by Gustavus‘s gesture and pass down then DoW baton to Lester B Pearson (Canada). Not sure that Lester will humour this little game DoWing the Boers or something, when the situation at home is so dire (even if he‘s managing to hold for the time being).\nOn the Texan-Inuit side of the war, we see Baltimore about to fall, making of San Antonio the next clear objective. Puzzlingly, a big battalion of Texan units (including the mighty Chuck Norris on the rearguard) seems to be heading away from the battlefield and into the secluded city of New York. Has Sam Houston given up hopes on most of his empire and planning a last stand at the Big Apple?"

  narration: "The war, similarly keeps being waged among the two man-children among their island holdings with no real gains for either nation. More interestingly, The Trung Sisters have taken over Indrapura and Thi Li Bi Nai is taking damage. After an unexpected reversal at the beginning of the war (damn Vietcongs), we see the Vietnam we know and love razing through Champaland at great speed. It may be time to be reading those well-polished Fs for Che."

  narration: "On the other hand, their war against Australia has come to a stall. You could believe that this was the exact same image as several slides ago, but the sidebar notifications assure us that yes, time has indeed passed, yet this region seems frozen in time."

  narration: "What is this? Has Sam Houston secretly learned cloning? We have now two Chuck Norrises, side by side marching onto the Inuit front. It is a bit distressing, though, that they seem to have taken some damage. Are the Inuit packing atomic bombs already? I cannot imagine anything else putting a dent on Norris. Or maybe... was it the cloning process? Does it work as some kind of meiotic halving?"

  narration: "Back on the South American theatre we see more wars coming to a stall. Morgan flips yet again Incan cities (which will flip again), while Chile manages to defend their latest gains. Several Brazilian cities have been air-bombed to oblivion, but there‘s no way for O‘Higgins to capitalise on it without paratroopers."

  narration: "Kuchum Klan has entered the Atomic Era (as though he wasn‘t already frightening enough) and we get a peek at their core lands. Hopefully, harbouring that Roman unit will not put him on Ekeuhnick‘s (Inuit) black list. We also see Canada reclaiming the mythical land of Sarnia from the Inuit. I believe this is the northern-most Canadian recapture in at least 2 parts!"

  narration: "Pedro II finally deigns to make a move with his overwhelming army and the result is an easy capture of two cities. Why cannot you be like this all the time, Pedro? Thankfully, the Chilean dynamic duo of GWIman and Worker boy managed to clear out of La Rioja before it fell."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene30.jpg'
  narration: "Several things happened on the dawn of this new turn. On one hand Yakutia and Burma reached a truce agreement (irrelevant) but so did Carthage and the Ayyubids! The Ayyubids surrender no other than Dvin to the assailing Carthagenese as the price for peace (according to the minimap). That‘s right, friends, given the chance of surrendering one of their two heavily citadel‘d and almost dead, Ethiopia-provoking cities, they gave away the undamaged, pristine Suez channel! #DumbThingsAIDoes\nOn the other hand, that Sri Lankan privateer carpet threateningly looming over the Champa borders was indeed the sign of things to come! Parakramabahu wants a bite of that cake before the Trung Sisters clean it out. Oh and Yakutia, again irrelevantly, also DoWs Champa. Is it me, or do the words 'Yakutia' and 'irrelevant' always find themselves in the same sentence, part after part?"

  narration: "Also, we get to see finally some action on the Viet-Burmese front. 'I‘m-a-wrather' shrewdly (or cowardly, take your pick) sends his forces South against Vietnam‘s weakened and almost undefended new acquisition of Indrapura, giving a wide berth around the much closer, 81-defence, Vietnamese city of Bago."

  narration: "Oh-ho! Payback is a bitch! Korea, emboldened by their successful Manhattan Project and its absurd carpet of submarines have decided to finally retake by force that city that they once were intimidated into giving Vietnam, and maybe some more! With the ink still wet on the DoW, Busan is already on the yellow and Hue started taking damage. The Trung Sisters, in their hubris, left the North part of their empire entirely undefended and is up for the taking!"

  narration: "Harun Al-Rashid (Arabia) decides to get serious about his war with Sri Lanka and sends the best and most of his army to the Oman tip. Parakramabahu seems unfazed as his cities stand strong despite the minimum presence of defending units, and keeps bombarding the nearby city of Najra.\nOn the sidebar, we see that the Champa managed to convince Vietnam to stop their assault, but the minimap suggests it came at the cost of a city, as it‘s usually the case for the enemies of the shrewd Sisters."

  narration: "As you can see, the East-West divide pretty much keeps going up North into the Pacific, where Vietnam has been helping Jandamarra (Kimberley) keep the Socceroo forces from extending. I honestly don‘t see things shifting too much after this, with Australia controlling the Central Territory and East Coast of the continent, plus the island of Papua/New Guinea, while Kimberley controls the West Coast and most of the East Indies (not controlled by Vietnam)."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part41-scene37.jpg'
  narration: "Yet another almost photocopy from previous slides. The only difference is that an Australian reinforcement contingent that had been waiting on the borders have finally joined the fray (not that it will make much of a difference, while) a smattering of Blackfoot units approach, seeking another chance at an easy snipe. It seems unlikely that Australia will hold the ex-Japanese islands for long, but the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) better realize that the moment they capture them, Sejong (Korea) will jump in to dispute them with his indisputable naval superiority. It may actually be a good idea to make peace with Henry Parkes (Australia) and quit while ahead."

  narration: "Back to South America, we see that Chile our unlikely duo of Chilean heroes have managed to retake La Rioja. A fated-to-be short-lived victory and worthless in the big picture, but O‘Higgins should be glad for the morale boost, especially given that he may now kiss goodbye any chances of ever recapturing the Incan coastal cities. Speaking of which, a tiny contingent of the Hawaiian peace-keeping corps sweeps in to let Tiwanaku remain Incan from another day... but is it wise of Kamehameha (Hawaii) to incur on the ire of a such powerful nearby naval power?"

  narration: "In North-America, things are getting dire for the non-indigenous civilizations. Winter has rode on Inuit shoulders deep into the Texan core, threatening to put an end to summer forever. Puzzlingly, the combined strength of two Chuck Norrises is not singlehandedly driving the invaders awa... waaait a minute! Those are /Texan Rangers/, not /Ranger Texas/! It‘s just an UU that replaces the Cavalry and grants culture and Golden Age points per each unit defeated (which I don‘t think are Sammy‘s main concerns right now). We can only hope that they possess a fraction of Mr. Norris‘s mettle."

  narration: "Nope, these Texan Rangers were no able to pull a Ranger Texas. True, they are facing against helicopters and tanks, but you know that wouldn‘t even give pause to the real thing. Now, the city of San Antonio lies unprotected to the advance of the White Walkers, and Sam Houston‘s namesake city seems to be next. In the meantime, the thick of his army cowers  on the unthreatened cities of New York and Dallas.\nYou know, if I were Benito Juarez (Mexico), I‘d consider swinging in to rescue his old Texan nemesis. Sure, he could also DoW him and try to get a few cities before the Inuit exterminate them all (like the Blackfoot did to Canada), but I think that helping remove that icy stalactite tip from within North America‘s metaphorical chest should be a priority, lest the whole continent suffers frostbite in a little while."

  narration: "And here we get another shot of the heroic efforts of Canada, trying to wrestle away the polar bear‘s grip of the Inuit over the Hudson‘s Bay. Both armies in the zone look rather thin at the moment, but in the Inuit‘s case it‘s more a result of having concentrated their troops down South on the invasion of Texas than of production exhaustion. Crowfoot seems to have indeed obtained open borders from Ekeuhnick, but he don‘t seem to be mobilising any units towards Canada yet."

Napoleon (France) is currently parading his two UUs on the other side of the channel, but they will prove near useless when (not if) Ingolfur starts raining death from above."

  narration: "Long time ago, Stalin (U.S.S.R.) colonised the barren and frozen coasts on the Kara Sea, so strong was his desire of having a seaside vacation home. Unfortunately, all those cities fell prey to the Sibir menace. Kekkonen, (Finland) always the altruist, has taken pity of him and decided to bring the ocean to Stalin: an uninterrupted sea of highly advanced clear blue units, that are about to become even more sophisticated as Kekkonen enters the Atomic Era. Stalin must be reconsidering the Marxist stance on religion, as only divine intervention can now prevent the incoming tsunami."

  narration: "What would you know? The Trung Sisters did reach a truce with Henry Parkes. As far as I can tell, no cities changed hands in this deal, so the Sisters at the very least retained their late gains. Back at the time of the Wobbegong Armada‘s peak we wouldn‘t have believed that another country would get the better out of a naval confrontation with Australia, but what did we know?"

  narration: "And here we see the spoils that Vietnam got from Cham... wait a second, what is going on here? Indrapura did fall under Burmese occupation! Is this Burma‘s first ever city capture? Nevertheless, we can now clearly see that it‘s the city of Lam Ap Pho the one given away  by Champa in the peace deal. As we see a hint of the Sri Lankan navy arriving from the West, only to be blocked by that city‘s borders, surrendering it to the Vietnamese may have been a shrewd move, Che Bong Nga! (Champa) Too bad that your empire is now a super narrow strip of land and sea."

  narration: "Moving a bit to the West we get to see what‘s left of the Champa navy scramble to contain the approaching Sri Lankan navy. They seem matched both in numbers and technological development so I don‘t see anything coming out of this (other than the gruesome squander of human lives, that is.) The Sibirian girl-scout corps descend upon the scene like vultures, to peddle cookies at both sides of the combatants."

  narration: "Further to the West we find that Carthage now borders Arabia and Armenia, who woulda thunk? The Ayyubid 'empire' is now reduced to two heavily citadel‘d and disconnected cities, summing no more than 10 tiles total between them. Haile Selassie (Ethiopia) could easily snack on them, but doing so would unnecessarily elevate his warmonger penalty, possibly attracting the undesired attentions of the giant next door.\nIn other news, despite the decent carpet of Arabian units nearby, the Sri Lankan city of Batticaloa has barely received damage. What the hell, Harun, you have a few planes too. Use them!"

With nary a trace of the famed Wobbegong Armada around and the thick of the Australian land forces marching North-West against Rubibi, the Kimberley may have recovered the Red Fort for good. (For a while, at least.)"

  narration: "If the Finnish troops constituted a sea, the Inuit forces are an endless ice sheet, threatening to initiate a new Ice Age, starting with old foe Tygyn Darkhan (Yakutia,) as the fair Em finds out.

  narration: "Back to North America, we see San Antonio breathing its last gasp. More terrifyingly, Ekeuhnick has reached the information era. This is a very telling slide. I‘m almost positive that if we ran it just by the numbers, the combined armies of the four visible non-Inuit civs would be incapable of defeating the visible Inuit army, let alone the carpet of destroyers and helicopters chilling out on the North Pacific. Heh, 'chilling'."

  narration: "In a blitz of submarine fire and paratroopers, Korea has recaptured their old city Busan! Moreover, Hue is on its last legs and the nearby Vietnamese contingent doesn‘t seem strong enough to defend or recapture it. This was remarkable quick for a civ with no planes (which is surprising given Korea‘s technological advancement, and possibly explained by a lack of oil). If Sejong manages to retain that momentum, he may  be able to quickly grab several cities and sue for peace from a superior position before reinforcements arrive."

  narration: "Apparently at some point, Pachacuti (Inca) rallied his troops and managed to recapture two of his coastal cities again. Such off-screen glory was short-lived and our gaze returns just in time to see him losing those cities again to marauding Buccaneers. Slightly to the South, it seems that Chile has managed to hold onto La Rioja (even as an enterprising Incan Lancer attempts a snipe), and the minimap reveals that they also have recaptured Catamarca."

  narration: "A shot of the Bay of Bengal reveals that the Sri Lankan city of Anuradhapura has taken a tiny bit of damage. In the sea, both civs‘ privateers are also duking it out, unproductively. The Mughal seem stronger on land, while the Sri Lankan seem stronger on the sea. And yet, Akbar (Mughal) decided to initiate hostilities on a coastal city. *sigh*"

  narration: "Against all odds, plucky Canada stands its ground and recovers Regina (though this may be less a result of the Canadian army‘s prowess and more a result of Ekeuhnick focusing his forces on the disemboweling of the Texan core. This turn of good luck for Lester B Pearson (Canada) may prove ephemeral, as previous ally against the Inuit, Ingolfur the Viking, seems to be eyeing the fabled lands of Vinland (now under Canadian rule) for an early retirement home, according to agent Semiramis."

  narration: "San Antonio has fallen and Houston (the city, and perhaps the Leader?) is taking great damage. As an baby-blue Helicopter arrives to Gonzales, the distressing nightmare of an Inuit Caribbean holding congeals into plausibility. With rumors of Sam Houston having been deathly wounded, civilian and militia alike literally throw themselves into the sea, desperately running away from the unstoppable glacier flattening their lands. Heartbreakingly, there‘s not enough room in the sea for all of them. This may be the saddest image I‘ve seen in the whole BR2.\nIn the meantime, the band of half-hearts and deserters that turned tail from war keep crowding the city of New York, huddling for comfort against the comparative safety of the Canadian borders. Talks of secession run the streets..."

Reinforcements for Kimberley are arriving from the sea, but they may not be enough to keep the city after the few customary flips. Sure enough, the Australian land forces have earned their nickname, 'the Grave Diggers'."

Sadly, he‘s about to find out that this newfound land is similarly war-torn as Chile and Brazil battle fiercely for possession of Eva‘s old cities. Unbeknownst  to the Zulu worker, a Boer worker is shadowing him. Does Paul Kruger suspect that this is in fact Shaka (Zulu) himself, in rags, and wants to keep an eye on him?"

Worse, a privateer managed to sneak into the Air-bombed city of Najran and capture it! While the once wise sultan squanders his nights listening to over a thousand tales, his empire slowly crumbles. Is it possible that Scheherazade is actually a Sri Lankan spy?"

'Man, this land war thing is much easier than what I thought it‘d be!' thinks the old Buccaneer while quashing another gallon of rum for his breakfast. Incidentally, in the meantime, the Inca have managed to reclaim the smoldering wreckage of their coastal cities once again. Morgan is unfazed. He knows that it shan‘t stick."

Since most of the cities under dispute in the Oceanic war are Kimberley, Australia remains in a strong 3rd position."
