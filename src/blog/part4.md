  narration: "In central Asia, the Mongols capture the Tibetan city of Rutog. Tibet’s northern cities are wide open for conquest, yet the bulk of Genghis’s army is pointed east, towards the red dragon. Perhaps Genghis is using Tibet as a ruse to direct attention away from his true intentions? Meanwhile, Songstan Gampo sends a settler west to expand his empire after his losses."

  narration: "Speaking of the Champa, both the Vietnamese and Burmese declare war on them. The Vietnamese look like the bigger threat, as the brunt of their army is bearing down on Vijaya. While Anawrahta also wields a sizeable enough force, it is too far away to make the immediate impact the Trung sisters are capable of."

  narration: "In the Russo-Hunnic kitchen, the heat is highest around Kharkov. The Russian strategy of sending a settler to the front seems to be copped from their Scandinavian neighbors.

  narration: "Speaking of Israel, it turns out the country’s military is not entirely made of scouts. Their biggest immediate threat is the Armenians, who send their workers south.

  narration: "A look at military manpower. No one comes close to Haile on the African continent, and if he wants to expand, he needs to do so fast. The steppes are where the rest of the truly huge military powers reside. The Yakutians, Huns, Sibirs and the Timurids all have huge armies. Akbar’s army to their south is nothing to sneeze at either. With five of the eight largest armies, along with a surging China, Asia will be a quite interesting continents in the coming days."

  narration: "Meanwhile, the Champa and Kongo own two of the smallest armies; not a good sign for the Champa’s current conflict, nor for Kongo’s proximity to  Ethiopia. The Byzantines should take note as well; a bottom five military in their geographic position sells disaster. \nFinally, shame on Kamehameha and Gajah Mada for having smaller militaries than the observer civ."

  narration: "And you thought Lincoln was weak? O ye of little faith! \nLincoln laughs at your doubt, raises an army, and declares war on Texas. Perhaps this time annexation will not be quite as peaceful. The Americans have a tech advantage, and a size one. It may take a while for the full effect of the Union’s forces to kick in, as a chunk of his forces are up north awaiting the order to begin Operation: Fallout Roleplay."

  narration: "Benito Juarez sits in his war room. A courier bursts in.”Sir! Lincoln has declared war on Texas!”\nHis generals’ expression turns to shock. They all look at their leader; he is stoic, looking over a map of North America. He snaps. Drawing his saber, he yells “Give me back my province!” as the saber’s tip lands squarely on Austin. Thus, the long-awaited order was given, and troops move towards Austin."

  narration: "On the flip side, the Spartans now have enough soldiers to have a shot at Cumae. If Cumae fell, the Hoplites have a straight shot at Rome. Even if the war would involve huge casualties, the Spartans could take it."

  narration: "Poor Gyantse. The city finally falls, spelling doom for any Tibetan plans to expand outside the Himalayas. \nIf the Tibetans had played their cards right, the city could have been a Tibetan stronghold and given them a out into the Indian Ocean.

  narration: "In a middle finger to history, Casimir III joins the Nazis in declaring war on Sparta. Polish horsemen thunder down the plains of Tegea. \nOne wonders if the Polish declared too soon.

  narration: "The Buccaneers complete the Terracotta Army. The belligerents in the Great American Clusterfuck should thank their maker that it was not one of them that completed the wonder. Morgan, on the other hand, now has multiple options. He could strengthen his North American holdings by reinforcing Petit-Gouave or, perhaps, taking Dallas; Reinforcements in South America are also viable. \nIn other news, the Bucs’ economy has seen an upturn in job creation from new rum distilleries."
