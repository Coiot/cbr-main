  narration: "IT’S ON!\n \nSweden declares war on Sparta in an epic future blockbuster movie that will tell the story of the fate of central Europe in 311 BC*. Both have impressive land armies but Sweden’s is located closer to the front line and probably will capture a few cities before Sparta can move enough troops to defend Lodz and Warsaw. While I don’t think this will end either civ, I do think that central Europe may be unified after this war.\n*We‘ll call it Three Hundred and Bork"

The open terrain of the border would make it easy for both sides to move troops quickly, which would mean a lot of death on both sides. If the Inuit move their troops to the right place a capital might fall very quickly."
