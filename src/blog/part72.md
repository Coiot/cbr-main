  narration: "Hello everybody, and welcome back to the Civilization 5 Battle Royale! I‘m u/_Layton, but you can call me Laycutus of Boerg. Ricky, Jack, if you‘re reading this, you know my reddit handle now. But I don‘t care, because ha ha, jesus christ, I‘d like to see you chumps get to do something like this. \nIn the last part, we saw the Boers taking ass and kicking names, as well as some lovely strife up near the Yakuts and the Inuit. Countless lives lost, and with any luck, countless more to follow. Let‘s get going.\nThis lovely (read:Terrifying) picture of what we know as 'West Africa' (And what is probably referred to as 'The glass desert' is brought by a fellow member of the boerg collective u/Spherical_Melon. /u/TA_Knight will also be tagging along giving us an in-depth look at all of the Religion slides."

  narration: "This lovely map comes from our dear friend u/edse1991, a Finland supporter. Cartography is likely a popular career in Finland, come to think of it. 'Just draw a big circle and label it ‘mine.‘'\nA bit of an overview, for those of you who missed the last part:\n1. Iceland lifted a city off of the Boers\n2. Where did Ethiopia go?\n3. Inuit took a city from the Snoryaks\n4. Mexico and Buccs are bullying poor Texas"

  narration: "Here is a map detailing the 'War of Orange Containment,' as it seems to be called. It looks a lot like a case of Paul Kruger (Boers) against the World. Little do they know, he‘s actually the top fighter on this side of Toronto."

  narration: "The Inuit have wrested the #1 spot from Paul Kruger‘s (Boers) cold, robotic hands and have firmly placed it inot their own cold hands. They‘re in a pretty good spot to take some Yakutian holdings, but if someone like Korea chooses to intervene it might be enough to push them back."

  narration: "And without much further ado, let‘s get right into- woah, check out Tibet‘s carpet. A force like that could give Vietnam a run for their money. I count 3 great generals in there, and some riflemen, which are a new kind of unit called 'Gunpowder.' I‘m not sure entirely what they do, since they aren‘t listed in the future worlds document, but they look strong.\nIn all seriousness, though, it looks like Vietnam is gearing up for an attack against Sri Lanka. Indietnam would make a good addition to Trung clay, and although there aren‘t that many great Future Worlds tile improvements inside of Sri Lanka, Vietnam does have a significant amount of workers to fix that. Lovely.\nThey also look to be interested in settling new cities. The city that TPang‘s selected is an itty bitty bastard, with just one guy in a shack looking over 4 bombers, a drone fighter, and an atomic bomb. I also count 2 settlers at a glance."

  narration: "Hawaii is so irrelevant that the first thing I noticed on this slide was that Paul Kruger (Boers) have made peace with the Khanate of Sibir. Good job, Siberia. You fought the boers and lived to tell the tale.\nMeanwhile, both Texas and Hawaii have declared war on Meiji (Japan). Apparently a human character is controlling these civs as part of a rogue experiment in the 'How would you win as __?' series.\nMakes you wonder whatever happened to rump state solidarity."

  narration: "Sibir‘s presence in the Middle East is duly noted, but their lands seem strangely empty. They had better do something about it soon, or risk an invasion of peacekeepers. Also, they have like 4 nukes. Probably a preventative measure in case the Trungs (Vietnam) decide to attack.\nDavid (Israel) is unsure what to do about his newfound life, and has taken to spamming missionaries like they‘re scouts, while shivering in fear of Tibet‘s military. Gunpowder? Impossible!"

  narration: "The fact that Iceland controls Sparta still impresses me. And they have a crapton of air support.\nThis slide has a lot. First, we see the desolate landscape of Northern Africa, with thousands and thousands of acres of nuked and pillaged improvements, as well as ancient cities like Tangier and Utique that have been reduced to one population.\nYou see the vast exile of Ethiopian units as they are cast into sea, but it looks like they‘re running out of sea to throw themselves into.\nYou see that Henry Morgan (Buccaneers) has learned that there‘s more to life than carriers, and he‘s started to build a lovely little navy over there.\nBut most importantly, you see an Orange Africa. Finally, a continent united under one flag. And they think we‘re the bad guys."

  narration: "It looks like the Ethiopian religion gives the Boers extra faith per desert tile. Good thinking, AI. Do what you were built to do.\nAlso, am I the only one that finds it funny that you can‘t improve Oasises even with future worlds? Like, they‘re not that good. Surely there‘s a future tech that can get a little more use out of Oasis. Maybe they could build a wonderful wall or something."

  narration: "There is almost no hope left for the Champa, but every time I see them I can‘t help but wonder how great it would be if they went out in a blaze of glory and just smashed a part of Vietnam‘s carpet.\nSpeaking of which, looking a little thin there, eh Henry? (Australia)"

  narration: "THE ORDER OF THE RUMP HAS SPOKEN! MEIJI (JAPAN), IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO DIE!\nIt makes you wonder what Japan did to deserve all of these diplomatic middle fingers. Perhaps they missed leg day? Is it high noon? Maybe they accidentally made a weird CG movie about penguins surfing, and Hawaii got offended. Guess we‘ll never know.\nInuit territory looking pretty bare here, but Mexico and the Blackfoot are in no position to take any."

  narration: "Osei (Ashanti) looks Paul (Boers) in the eyes, his own glittering with tears as salty and beautiful as the ocean before him. \n'My old friend,' he sniffles, 'It is hard to believe, that after so long, our journey is at an end.'\nPaul gently brushes away Osei‘s hair, gazing into his eyes.\n'In all likelihood, we will never meet again. Are you sure you want to go? There are countless others, almost as strong and powerful as I, that wish to see you destroyed, and ground into the dust like a rat.'\nOsei turns his head away, gazing at his troops, and at the beach that stood before them. The ancient wooden boats with magnificent masts that seemed to scrape the sky and part the clouds above them.\n'I know, but it is for the good of the Ashanti people, the good of my men, that we set out and explore this cylinder of ours. Perhaps, if we travel far enough, we will meet the great Observer, whomever and wherever he is.'\nPaul nods, swallowing as he nods to his old friend. The Ashanti pikemen, the warriors of a time long forgotten, begin to make their way onto the ships. He feels a strange lump in his throat, and he senses that it will be a while until it passes.\nOsei turns and boards the ship with his men, waving to Paul as his ships begin to depart. Paul, along with a thousand other Boer citizens, watch as the Ashanti Pikemen embark into the open water on the horizon.\nAs he watches them sail away, he can‘t help but wonder if they know how to cross ocean territory yet."

  narration: "Henry Parkes (Australia) once again refuses to upgrade old and hopelessly outdated units. C‘mon, Australia. That thing is an antique by now. That can‘t possibly be viable. It made sense with the diggers, since those are upgraded workers. This, though, this is just ridiculous."

  narration: "The Inuit reflip the former Yakutian city of Russkoye Ustye, and they also get Isit. They had flipped this prior, but I was too busy writing homoerotic alternate-historical fanfiction to comment on it. TPang told me to stick to 100 words or less."

  narration: "The Ice Sheet Fleet looks to be taking full advantage of its new opening into the rest of the ocean, but there‘s still a considerable force trapped up in the ice. Speaking of which, the Yakutian force on the last slide also looks pretty sick, doesn‘t it? That‘s definitely a force to be reckoned with. \nBlackfoot are still hopelessly outclassed by the Inuit. Poor sods. Looks like they have some semblance of open borders, though."

  narration: "The Buccaneers fell a city containing a Boer Giant Death Robot. How this crack team of marines did it is up for debate, but we here at Battle Royale Ltd. have already secured the movie rights.\nIt looks like the Boers are having a bit of a problem capturing coastal cities. This is, completely understandable, given that they have no naval presence up there. This might take a while, but I have faith. We are boerg. You will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you will service us."

  narration: "The Kimberley have declared war on Japan, it looks like. They‘re sending in some missile cruisers to deal with them. This might actually have an effect, unlike everyone else. It also increases the chance of the Kimberley getting totally screwed over, as well. Big Brother Korea won‘t be pleased if Japan gets nuked, that‘s for sure. It‘s a bit of a gamble. But one I‘m willing to watch other people take. Good luck, guys!"

  narration: "Paul Kruger (Boers) decides to employ an ancient strategy, and throws his massive carpet of workers at the enemies, instructing them to block the energy swords with their bodies. What he doesn‘t know, is that this is actually a defensive technique. The only other time this was used offensively, it was regarded as 'Incredibly ineffective.'\nDon‘t worry, I‘m sure they‘ll be fine."

  narration: "Ethiopia has officially been exiled from the East side of Africa. The boerg will most likely hold these cities, and it looks possible for them to take the entire rest of Ethiopia as well. What can I say, you mess with the bull, you get the hoerns.\nNo, that joke sucked. Sorry.\nMeanwhile, the Ashanti pikeman sails up the coast, in search for someone to trade them the secrets of deep-sea sailing. Unfortunately, it appears they forgot that they are not in Civilization IV. Meanwhile, Paul Kruger (Boers) realises that he forgot to give Osei Tutu (Ashanti) a map."

  narration: "Ethiopian deserters, seeking soils of refuge from the war against the Boerg hivemind, hide out in Finnish territory while the Sibir appears to gear up for a war with 4 nukes and 2 bombers in Caen. Kekkonen (Finland), however, does not in the slightest appear ready for a war. Fortunately for him, the proximity of the Ethiopian troops and the Tibetan city makes the usage of a nuke unlikely, as the AI knows that this will mean accidentally declaring war on 2 other countries. You lucked out, Finland."

Other than that, their core is pretty empty, and they run the risk of losing Desert Folklore since David (Jerusalem) keeps spamming missionaries.

The Inuit architecture is enough to make anyone uncomfortable. Lachlan took a drag off of his vape as he looked up and around the place. When did it fall? Who did it belong to? He casts a side-glance to the silent Inuit men that patrol nearby. Are they even men? Lachlan didn‘t know what to call them. He sighed, and returned to his unit. New orders were to come in soon, supposedly. Anything to get him out of this place. Away from those... Things."

  narration: "Someone must have forgot to uncheck 'Avoid growth' on Boston and Montreal. Those cities have been Inuit for at least 10 parts. How are they so tiny? \nThe Inuit core cities here look to have filled up a fair bit, but there is a faint yet unmistakeable essence of... Overextension? A big enough force, like a coalition of Brazil, Bucccaneers, and Blackfoot, could probably do decent damage to this area, possibly take a few cities and divide up the Inuit forces. Not enough to screw them over, but enough to be... A significantly smaller threat."

  narration: "Oh, look. The Buccs have discovered the X-Men, and are now being led by Magneto. Fortunately for the humans all across the cylinder, since Nazi Germany never actually committed the holocaust, he is far less dangerous and emotionally volatile in this universe. Whew.\nAlso of note, the Icelandic carpet has a very significant presence in Europe. If a war were to break out between Iceland and Sveden, the navies would likely reach a stalemate, but the Swedish land holdings are almost certainly forfeit to the Icelandic troops. Good on them for knowing the importance of home security.\nSome previously Portuguese (or perhaps Moroccan/Datlovian) cities are losing HP, but until the Boers take back their coastal cities it is unlikely that anything will happen to them."

A single Ethiopian unit, overcome with grief, makes the long trek toward Buccaneer Sanctuary though Boer assimilated lands. He has almost made it, but the brutal Boer Chimeras have caught up to him, bringing him in for forced assimilation. The Ethiopian massacre was brutal, and will be remembered by the world as an act of pure evil."

  narration: "The last Ethiopian military squad has been defeated, but they are not without help, as Hawaiian and Mongolian peacekeeper units gather from all across Africa to defend the last sanctum of Ethiopia. The Boers, despite being slowed down by the sea, are brutalizing what is left of Ethiopia as Bamako is assimilated while all the citizens in Medina have been massacred.\n \nA few kilometers away, but on a whole another plane, Israel attempts once again, but fails to pass Judaism as the religion of the world. Armenia, angry at Israel for taking all the spot light for being the savior of Judaism, hatches a plan. Bargain with Sibir for open borders, gather any military they have, and send it toward Gaza. Their plan appears to have succeeded, as Gaza is seen under attack under Armenia, and the musketmen have been killed. The city of Gaza still stands proudly over the sieging army, raining down rocks on them using trebutchets, but the technologically superior Armenian army does not even flinch. Gaza will not hold another part."

While naval reinforcements find it almost impossible to approach, land units and drones are coming via Igloolik, ready to take out Verkhoyanksy. The Finnish peacekeeper defense proves to be a double edged sword for Yakutia as they find themselves unable to move their navy forward."

  narration: "Sibir is somewhat successful in wearing down Afghanistan, as a Siberian tank approaches Kabul, ready to capture it. This moment gives me a bit of a Deja-Vu though, to the beginning of this war, where once Sibir cut their way to Kabul, Vietnam entered the war throwing their plans into a disarray. Lets hope it doesnt happen again. \nSibir holds a few atomic bombs at Carrolton, but its unknown if they are ment for Afghanistan or for Sparta. Since Sibir has peaced out with the Boers, realizing what mistake it was, they are now free to move an army into Dvin, getting their very own hold on Africa."

  narration: "Iceland is getting used to their new front, but it seems they are learning well from the Buccaneers as they flip Carthage and try to reinforce Olympia from the Boer army. Iceland has played a risk in this war, as the city of Sparta is very close to the Boer borders and is very hard to reinforce. However, Iceland has secured open borders with Finland, which should at least allow some unit transport. Like Brazil, Iceland is doing what they can to slow down the Boer menace."

  narration: "Vietnam is very eager to fight their new enemy, bringing an air force to Baghdad. A Vietnamese PAI unit makes their way to Basra, wanting to see how the enemy looks like. Needless to say, this will be painful.\n \nOn the nuke map, we can see several nukes landing on Cairo, Baalbek, Awasa and Basra, as well as what appears to be the first Boer nuke landing on Damascus. It seems that the Boers are getting tired from using brute force only and are copying their enemies in nuke usage.\n \nAlso notable is the city of Klerksdorp, nuked by Ethiopia at the end of last part, is already fallout free. How is that? A closer look shows many Boer workers working hard to clear out damages, allowing the glorious Boer cities to return to their former glory. While the population loss remains, the vast infrastructure in still is high efficiency."

  narration: "West Africa is a whole another story, as the Buccaneers have made a heap of destruction from their formerly held cities, punishing the Boers for every inch. The Buccaneers has been valiant in their efforts to hold down cities on Africa, though they now face new challenges, as the Boer air force, notable for keeping half the Ethiopian cities in the black and stopping the Ethiopian advance at its very beginning, is now focusing on the Buccaneers themselves. Can the Buccaneers still hold?"

  narration: "On what used to be the front between the Boers and Ethiopia, the Boers are moving another fleet, composed of the usual units and the signature Boer caravels, toward their target, either Ethiopian Arabia or Vietnamese Sri Lanka. The Ashanti Pikeman, ready to see a world, joins in tow, though their deep sea faring credentials remain in question.\n \nThe Boers, despite facing a force far stronger than they expected, have successfully held down Africa tightly. Now with Africa completely theirs, the Boers now need to prove their worth in new continents. Maybe not at this very moment, as the entire world bears war on them, but certainly soon, as the Boers will emerge from this war far stronger than before. The Ryk calls for the world to be assimilated. Resistance is futile."

  narration: "Finland is still recovering ever since the Siberian war, but an army is forming and infrastructure is rebuilding. Finland has to get used to their new state in the world, now bordering the Buccaneers, Iceland, and even a border with the Boers. What will the future hold?"

  narration: "With Ethiopia out of the war, the Buccaneers stream deeper into the Mediterranean in effort to contain the Boers. New Buccaneer Mutants make their way to Africa, ready to defend their homeland. They arent truly a match for Boer Chimeras, sadly."

  narration: "And now into the religion slides! Its been a long time since we had these, so I‘‘l take the time to describe what they do.\n \nAkkat-U is one of the more useful religions, getting gold for Tibet, and up to 15% more production for followers of the religion. This ensures Tibet will always have enough gold, and any civilization with this religion will have a production advantage over their enemies."

  narration: "Buddhism is a religion that would‘ve been very useful were these actual human players, but sadly useless in our world of the BR. Numerous happiness, faith and tourism bonuses that would allow a player to dominate, but are wasted on an AI. Oh well.\n \nCatholicism‘s strength lies in 15% more growth rate when not at war, which stacks nicely with Future Worlds, and Religious Fervor, the ability to buy Industrial and above units. This will be very useful for lower production civilizations to reinforce themselves, possibly why Mexico has held for so long."

  narration: "Islam is a religion that has been cut very early into its forming, being founded right between Judaism and Oriental Orthodoxy. As a result Islam never had the chance to expand, or even get it self a second follower or enhancer belief. The reformation belief however ensures this religion will never truly go away."

  narration: "Judaism is a religion that should‘ve brought their founder extreme strength, boasting both bonus faith from foreign cities, the ability to purchase pre-industrial units, as easy great person generation in the Industrial Era or above. Instead, Israel focused so much on religion they ended up being one of the weakest civilizations.\n \nOriental Orthodoxy was a very militaristic religion. Along with early gold when expanding the religion, it also provided faith when a unit died close to a friendly city, and the defenders gained +20% strength when near a friendly city. This religion accounts for the Boer military loss in the war, along with the Ethiopian UA which added another +20%, though they ultimately failed."

  narration: "And lastly, Shinto, the religion founded by Japan. provided bonus strength when attacking enemy cities. This would‘ve been a very beneficial bonus for Japan, however Australia ended them fairly quickly when Japan thought about expanding into the Philippines. Oh well."

  narration: "And now for the religion overview! Most religion populations are on a rise, except Islam, who dropped from 6 to 5, and Oriental Orthodoxy, who was on a free fall for the last few parts, though only lost 3 net population units this part. Now with Ethiopia gone, this religion is likely to grow back to their former numbers."
