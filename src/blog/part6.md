    of the last installment.\n \nDon‘t forget to open the full resolution image!"

  narration: Japan holds a perilous position still. While their main island is defensible,
    and somewhat unlikely to fall to the dragon of China or the magpie of Korea (did
    you know that the magpie is Korea’s national bird? I didn’t know that. But now
    you do!), they remain a bit blocked in from settling anywhere, and unless some
    brilliant AI work pulls off military victories galore… turtling may yet be their
    fate.

  narration: God, I’d love to live in the islands of Hawaii. It just seems… nice.
    Look at all those composite bowmen! Now that’s what I call job security. As they
    have a Great General sneaking around Honolulu, it’s quite likely that his name
    is Kamehameha, and that soon the fierce warriors of Hawaii shall swarm over the
    island of Japan in an ironic fate-y twist to history. Although it may not be the
    Eastern Lands that they conquer first, as we see....

  narration: "… Here. Hawaii wants that sweet American soil. They’re not alone in
    this, of course, it’s just that most of the inhabitants want it all for themselves.
    Mexico has gotten its spearmen together and is finally moving in on Austin, but
    will they actually do something this time, or just surround the walls and taunt
    them again?"

  narration: Here we see the Pirates Who Don’t Do Anything in their natural habitat
    - jungling, with plenty of rum to take mid. Bucs OP, pls nerf. I assume I am not
    the only one wishing to see a mighty empire of black land sprawling across the
    Caribbean. No? No. Good.

  narration: The pressure builds. Not the Melbourne method, Johnny! That one took
    hours! And will likely take hours more as Whanganui-a-Tara’s territory starts
    pushing up against the Australian border. A strong fleet of triemes and another
    settlers may be what it takes for the ol’ Aussies to lead in any potential war.
    But as Dracula said to Dooku - I wouldn’t count on it.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene09.jpg
  narration: "Speaking of Australian settlers, looks like one cheeky bloke is trying
    to sneak past the aborigines here. Where he thinks he’s going I have no clue,
    especially with that Filipino settler sitting quite happily in the only strategically
    sound piece of empty land around. Perhaps they’re going to visit their father,
    or perhaps My Son. Regardless of the final location, it’s doubtless a bad idea
    to leave a city cut off so far from your main territory… \nMeanwhile... the Kimberley
    nab Uluru, much to the disdain of a probably lost Aussie worker on his way to
    the Sunshine Coast."

  narration: 'Egypt/Sparta vs Byzantium: Spartzantium Harder relaunches as Egypt’s
    triemes try some potshots at the Kommenos fleet, and David sends out missionaries
    and a Great Prophet to spread the word of YHWH and to invite the Egyptians and
    the Armenians to his kid Absalom’s bar mitzvah. No one comes.'
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene11.jpg
  narration: "Now that Sparta and Egypt have both declared on poor Alexios, Leo’s
    forces continue to move in on Ohrid… very… slowly… Something will doubtless happen
    in this war. Any moment now. Really. \nMeanwhile Poland sits quietly in the north
    and dreams of rockets. They’re all pretty sure that it’s their destiny, even after
    that one guy declares that he dreamed of everyone going to an alien world where
    there’s no religion and where trade routes on cities are limited. His neighbors
    quickly silence him, fortunately, and bury the body next to that one guy who said
    they could get to space by blowing things up."

  narration: Maria and Elizabeth make peace, giving each other fake plastic smiles
    and telling each other that they’ll be totes besties now, and probably have a
    day where they wear pink. Elizabeth, at least, is probably motivated in part by
    the carpet of blue sitting at York’s doorstep.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene13.jpg
  narration: She DOES have an army, of course, but it’s mostly situated near Ireland
    (Scotland? I’ll call it Scotland for now). If England declares, they would either
    quickly take some Irish cities or quickly get stomped by the equally stronk Irish
    army waiting on their doorstep.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene14.jpg
  narration: Content with his spoils of the Baltimore Ravens and equally confident
    that he can stop any riots through good old fashioned Texan machismo, peace is
    made with Lincoln. Just in time too, as no one’s entirely sure if the 16th prezzie
    could have held off the encroaching army for much longer. It’s beginning to look
    like America won’t have much of a chance in this fight. Even if the Mexicans take
    Austin, it’s too little too late.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene15.jpg
  narration: Afghanistan, China, and Portugal hold the top three places in production.
    If China uses their power well I forsee trouble on the Asian front, and Portugal
    may be more of a contender now that peace has been made with England.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene16.jpg
  narration: Shaka, as usual, holds a bottom-place spot. The Zulus, normally such
    a terrifying foe, seem to be only a bunch of paper tigers. (What’s the word for
    a group of tigers again? A murder of tigers?) Harun Al-Rashid is also pretty unproductive,
    preferring to have grapes fed to him by a secondary wife with thoughts of feminism
    and freedom floating through her brain. Not enough to actually poison the grapes
    yet, just enough to ensure that his eniw and ydanrb has a little bit of eniru
    in it.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene17.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile it’s a battle royale between the Sioux and the Blackfoot! Well,
    since it’s only confined to one continent it’s not all that. We’ll call it a hunger
    games between the two tribes instead. Those catapults make it look pretty likely
    that we’ll see the loss of a city soon. I’m looking forward to it! Lamentations
    of cattle, carrying off of women, all that jazz.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene18.jpg
  narration: The land war of Leonidas would probably be doing a bit better if he actually
    brought that Great General to the front lines, but then I’m not a military genius
    whose men are trained like a pack of fierce animals. (Like an ambush of tigers.
    Did you know that the word for a group of tigers was an ambush/streak? That’s
    so dope. TIL.) Treibzond may be a viable target, however, if they can bring their
    navy to bear.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene19.jpg
  narration: "Nothing here we haven’t seen before, so I’ll just point out that the
    Spartans have a settler up there for absolutely no reason. I like to pretend that
    he’s just looking at Poland, wondering why there’s so many people there are obsessed
    with balls. \nPlatonically, of course."
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene20.jpg
  narration: And like that the city falls! The Blackfoot have taken a Sioux city,
    and are growing ever closer to their capital. A strong push forward could mean
    a lot for them here, and possibly control over all of Western Canada…
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene21.jpg
  narration: Old Sarai is in the red now, and will likely fall next turn. The Mongols
    need to turtle up and use that defensive ground they have, tearing apart the invading
    forces before they can get stomped.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene22.jpg
  narration: "‘Nam’s in a bit of a bad place right now, as their army seems much too
    spread out to effectively fight China. Tianjin is sitting alone, but so’s Ho Lu,
    and the Chinese army is far more ready… Can the catapult at Hai Phong be the turning
    point? Stay tuned!"
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene23.jpg
  narration: Oh, Shaka. Poor, tiny Shaka. If land was a metaphor for size of certain
    body parts, then you would be an ironic deconstruction of the popular (and sorta
    racist) stereotype about African-originated peoples right now, instead of the
    butt of a rather ineffective joke about stereotypes. What I’m saying is that you
    have no land and that’s a problem. The Boers will soon be the Goers.  But with
    an “R” in there, so they’ll be the Gorers.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene24.jpg
  narration: True to predictions from the peanut gallery of yours truly, Trebizond
    falls to the Spartans and their Bronze-Age power armor! Or more realistically,
    their fleet. Triemes appear to have significant city-bashing abilities, perhaps
    more ancient civilizations should have looked into this? Nicomedia, in the meantime,
    falls to the yellow - though it’s anyone’s guess whether Egypt or Sparta will
    get the kill-steal.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene25.jpg
  narration: Heh. Cute little Icelandic settler (everyone wave at the American trieme
    over there, give Lincoln our condolences and regards). Where do you think you’re
    going? My bet’s that spot with some copper ‘n sundry stuff, just below Sherbrooke.
    Would you watch an Iceland vs Canada-Final-Form battle? Because I would.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene26.jpg
  narration: Maria I, feeling emboldened by managing to stick a city next to Rome,
    has decided it’s time to put her big girl panties on and go for the city that
    was built in a turn. Perhaps she figures it’s a better idea than trying to take
    on France, and after all, if she manages to take some territory perhaps she’ll
    be better equipped to defend against the Big Blue Blob. Honestly, though, I don’t
    really see this in the cards for her. Rome is nearly all coast - really hard to
    capture, really easy to defend, and her army just doesn’t have what it takes to
    meatgrinder to victory. Leonidas meanwhile, decides he‘d be missing out on fun
    old times if he didn‘t join Maria in her quest to persecute the Romans.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene27.jpg
  narration: The Afghans are trying their hardest to carpet properly, confident that
    with enough arrows to blot out the sun their soldiers will have basically what
    are sunglasses, which will make all of them at least 20% cooler. Nearby Mughals
    in Agra scoff at this, and declare their cool-game “weak”.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene28.jpg
  narration: Aaaaaaand there goes Old Sarai! Will Sibit be content with a city that
    was so close to his territory they could smell the breeze from it, or will he
    attempt to cross the mountainous expanse and take more from the Mongols? They
    have a couple of archers and a catapult near the fresh prize, but no melee units,
    so it’s unlikely they’ll have a chance at recovery.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene29.jpg
  narration: 'Poor Russia looks a bit hemmed in here. They’d need an army of seamstresses
    to get out of it! #punoftheday'
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene30.jpg
  narration: And Nicomedia falls to the Spartan menace, which is much like the Phantom
    Menace in that they both would have benefited from more practical effects. With
    only a single trieme nearby, the Byzantines seem fated to have permanently lost
    a second city. We ride, Spartan brothers, we ride to Constantinople!
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene31.jpg
  narration: And Mexico, proving once more that living on a prayer is totes better
    than living in cities you’ve captured, declares peace with Texas. You had in the
    bag, guys, and you muffed it.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene32.jpg
  narration: Battle erupts around Sichangu and Hunkpapa! The Blackfoot armies have
    taken damage - can they hold on to what they’ve got? It doesn’t make a difference
    if they make it or not. Meanwhile, Lester B. Pearson gives the territory a beguiling
    grin.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene33.jpg
  narration: "They’ve got each other, and that’s a lot for loooooove… THEY’LL GIVE
    IT A SHOT. \n*coughs*\nIn a shocking turnaround of events, Byzantium RETAKES Nicomedia!
    It won’t last long but w/e. They tried. 7/10, Participation Award, etc."
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene34.jpg
  narration: Jandamarra completes The Oracle. It tells him he’s the wisest of the
    Greeks, which is weird seeing as how he’s very Aboriginal. Perhaps the Oracle
    was showing him a future filled with Greek migrants on the Australian Continent
    after a second massive world war.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene35.jpg
  narration: Surprisingly, Indonesia manages to spread out quite a bit in the open
    Oceania. Another of their settlers is floating across the seas, a gleam in their
    eye and their pants.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene36.jpg
  narration: Lester B. Pearson’s beguiling grin reaches max charge, and he declares
    on poor Sitting Bull. There’s not much hope for him now, hemmed in as he is by
    the Blackfoot and the bearers of Canifest Destiny combined. That’s a big army
    Canada’s got, and they’re not afraid to jam their hockey sticks where they please.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene37.jpg
  narration: Eh? Mexico too? Oh, Benito. Don’t you know that your men seem to have
    an irrational fear of ACTUALLY CAPTURING CITIES.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene38.jpg
  narration: Nicomedia flips again and Spartan troops land dangerously close to a
    number of Byzantine cities. The archers and city defense may be enough to defend
    properly… or it may not. C’mon, guys, you were totally awesome in that one movie!
    Land some more deathblows!
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene39.jpg
  narration: Oh, my sweet sweet Buccaneers. You know I love y’all. Their navy is growing
    fast, and it may be that the Arrr lmao’s launch an attack soon… the rum, after
    all, can’t be gone forever. Offscreen, Napoleon declares war on Hitler.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene40.jpg
  narration: In other news, Napoleon declares war on Hitler, but this time onscreen.
    There’s only room for one megalomaniacal dictator with dreams of conquering Europe
    HERE, buddy!
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene41.jpg
  narration: David and the nation of Israel declare war on Hitler, making my job difficult
    by being so inherently funny that no commentary could possibly make it funnier.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene42.jpg
  narration: Adolf… did you ever consider that you could try being better with people?
    Poland tosses a DOW, though those horsemen and warriors will have a tough time
    with all that Third Reich-y spear stuff.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene43.jpg
  narration: "Norway’s starting to look a little… cramped. And Sweden’s looking a
    little spread out. Could now be the time for true Nords to fight? Rumors of a
    young man in the army going by the name of Hjalti Early-Beard are, as of yet,
    unconfirmed. \nWe also see our first glimpses of the Norweigan unique Unit - the
    Birkebeiner! The Birkebeiner is a swordsman replacement that is stronger in Hills
    and faster in Snow and Tundra."
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene44.jpg
  narration: Yakutia’s Great Wall will surely keep all invaders out, as if that blanket
    of an army wouldn’t have done the job. Only partially kidding, as the horde of
    scouts to the north looks a real threat. Heck, I’d be terrified. People who go
    outside for fun are scary.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene45.jpg
  narration: Uh oh. Looks like we may not see the fanfiction-esque triumph of Israel
    over Berlin after all - Harun Al-Rasid DOW’s on David, and the only defensible
    terrain he has is desert. Desert and scouts.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene46.jpg
  narration: Saladin joins him. Yeah, don’t think we’ll be seeing any of that lovely
    blue-and-white border much longer. That’s actually really depressing, both for
    historical parallels and because I think the color’s prettier than most others.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene47.jpg
  narration: Somehow France has already brought Cologne down to red, and their armies
    have almost reached Munich as well… The history books cite the French invasion
    of Germany as the point wherein most prognosticators and students of alternate
    history started taking Advil.
- scene_number: "48"

  narration: "The armies of Australia - Kimberley and Aussie alike - gather. We may
    be seeing war here soon. God help those lost to the spiders and spears. \nAlso
    of interest is the Australian colonist working his way into the desert. Now that
    the Kimberley have managed it, it seems that they want some as well."
- scene_number: "49"

  narration: Perhaps Shaka is finally tired of being at the bottom of the lists, as
    he’s readied two more settlers to go find some unclaimed land. Good luck with
    that, buddy, you’ll need it.
- scene_number: "50"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene50.jpg
  narration: War brews in Africa as well. Who shall strike first? Who first shall
    fall? The gods do not play chess with men, but rather a fiddly little game involving
    lots of dice and angry accusations of cheating, along with lots of the equivalent
    of handing the pieces sticks of TNT and then giggling at them.
- scene_number: "51"

    damage. It’s the end of the world as they know it.
- scene_number: "52"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene52.jpg
  narration: "Cologne falls to La Grande Armee! Could Munich be next? I know who we’re
    all rooting for! \nNo, it’s not Hitler. Unless your name rhymes with “Evan Braun”
    you probably shouldn’t be."
- scene_number: "53"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene53.jpg
  narration: Is it just me, or are one-tile island cities really cute? I think they’re
    really cute. Oh, and in other news the newly settled inhabitants of Kopavagur
    say nasty things about the Irish.
- scene_number: "54"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene54.jpg
  narration: Varna will fall. All will fall before Sparta. Leonidas looks out over
    his territory and pronounces it good. The wolves will test the Byzantines. Born
    in the purple? The phalanx shall see what color they bleed.
- scene_number: "55"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene55.jpg
  narration: I’m not actually sure if what the Philippines has just done is called
    forward-settling, or just obstinately proving that AI has some difficulty imitating
    human cleverness. This could be an elaborate plot, of course, designed to either
    win the Domination victory or fool me into thinking that it’s not already plotting
    my eventual death and a more real-lifey sort of domination victory. But we’ll
    never know either way.

  narration: Tianjin is almost finished protesting the wholesale slaughter of their
    people, which is nice as it looks like their newfound conquerors have taken the
    wise strategy of holding their positions instead of assaulting China with a half-dead
    army.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part6-scene57.jpg
  narration: Cologne flips back, and may stay that way unless the French army actually
    reinforces. For once. Hitler makes peace with Elizabeth in the meantime, and thanks
    his lucky camps that she isn’t Churchill.

  narration: American Scout cannot speak any language but American, and so spends
    most of his time in the North confusedly asking people where the nearest coffee
    shop is, and complaining about why the people here cannot cook proper American
    food like pizza and hot dogs and Texan flags.

  narration: The Sioux nation is currently regretting sending out so many small cities.
    Nothing they can do about it now, of course, as all will go to feed the Great
    Beast of Revelations (here known as Canada, Dragon of which is Lester B. Pearson).

  narration: Mexico’s armies take damage, but move closer towards Sioux territory
    regardless. Sisselton seems their best bet, though if they can manage it Wahpekute
    will do as well.

  narration: And so it begins. Constantinople, the Other Rome, begins feeling the
    strikes upon its walls. Those archers will make for a nasty Spartan meatgrinder,
    but if they pressure it sufficiently… We may lose the Kommenos family. Which I’m
    okay with, I personally think Theodora’s more of a cutie.

  narration: Bethlehem falls to Saladin, and in an even more shocking turn of events,
    he declares upon Leonidas! Olympia won’t last long under that assault, and perhaps
    the Byzantines can take a breather if Leo sends troops to reinforce.

  narration: Meanwhile, Tutu declares on Hannibal, and everyone here giggles privately
    at his name. Everyone else is picturing regiments wearing pink tutus, right? It’s
    not just me?

  narration: Saladin, not content with warring on Israel and Sparta at once, also
    declares on Carthage. It’s okay, though, all the other civs are making fun of
    him because he’s got a silly hat.

  narration: "Armenia DOW’s on Leonidas! If I didn’t know better I’d say the other
    civilizations deliberately ganged up on any civ that looked likely to gain a strong
    advantage, like some massive socio-political representation of the metaphor about
    the farmer who cut down all the stalks of wheat that stood taller than the average.
    \nEthiopia denounces the Ayys, apropos of nothing. Claims they’re secretly controlled
    by strange men with scales on their necks, and grey-skinned creatures with big
    heads."

  narration: And so we come at long last to rankings! Leading in population is Afghanistan,
    closely followed by the Kanada Krew. Behind them trail, funnily enough, both of
    the civilizations hopping around Australia. The Sioux hold fifth place, but not
    for very much longer considering most of the continent is content to elderberry
    their mothers.

  narration: Shaka hasn’t managed to do much with his settlers yet, and so remains
    dead last. Poor David isn’t much better off considering the loss of Bethlehem,
    and I fear shortly we’ll all have to avoid making rather tasteless jokes about
    a certain civ’s loss. It’s also no surprise to see Byzantium in the 8th-from-last
    place.

  narration: The Kims may nearly equal Australia in population, but Australia is stronkest
    of civs with cities, holding 14 currently. Canada ties for fourth with Yakutia,
    but will likely get ahead fast once Lester’s otherworldly tentacles and disarming
    smile capture some more.

  narration: Israel is ahead of Germany this time, with the rather inept Fuhrer’s
    leadership leaving them 3 cities and no more than that. At least if one falls,
    the other is likely to as well. Other civs that are no surprise to see at the
    bottom are the United States, Rome, and Byzantium.

  narration: Aussies civs love their literacy, with the twain holding positions 2
    and 4 in science. Lester’s leadership ensures Canada the third-place spot, while
    Yakutia, somehow, manages 1st. The Sioux’s sixth place is unlikely to earn them
    a reprieve.

  narration: It’s a who’s who of losers down here - Rome, Israel, Germany, the Zulus,
    Byzantium, and (upsettingly) my homeboys the Irish. As they currently hold Scotland,
    I suggest an infusion of Nac Mac Feegle and kilts.

  narration: Australia is number one in land area, with the Inuit taking second and
    the soon-to-be-dead Sioux holding a somewhat uncomfortable third. Everyone wave
    at Lester in fourth over there, folks! The Red Menance plots and plans still.

  narration: We can be sure that no matter what happens to the Chosen People, their
    religion will live on - Judaism still has a massive lead over every other religion,
    double what the unopposed Catholicism has in the Americas. The Ayys insist that
    Islam is cool, but few seem to agree.

  narration: We end by checking out the world religion map, and I end by consoling
    myself with the pretty blue color. I’ve always love you, Light Teal. Thanks so
    much to TPangolin for the opportunity to narrate - it’s been awesome, he’s been
    patient, and all of you are great people for making this big enough for people
    like me to joyfully discover!
