  narration: "Good Day, civilization sadists, and welcome to the 52nd installment of the Civilization V Battle Royale! I am iSandpeople, your host for this week. Last time we checked in, the underdog Kimberley were pounding their Sri Lankan aggressors, the Trungs (Vietnam) continued to march their thousands into Afghanistan, and the Hawaiians were faced with two very concerning declarations of war from the Blackfoot and Chile. Now we enter yet another part, and like always, we want blood.\nThanks to /u/Cadellinman for his spooky rendition of future Kruger looking over his Boer empire!\nAnother thing worth noting is that /u/Jru2467 has released their newest part of the ongoing CBR comic series - ‘The Loser‘s Circle‘\nCheck it out here - https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/4fghcp/agent_em_issue_13_the_losers_circle_part_4/"

  narration: "Before we begin, feast your eyes on the elegant city map for turn 533, crafted with the blood, sweat and tears of LacsiraxAriscal & Co. in order for us civophiles to enjoy each part even more than we already do. Do yourself a favor and take a minute to enjoy the immense detail in full resolution."

  narration: "A surprise to none, I’m sure, (though the deviation is a bit high), the ever advancing Boer Empire lead part 51’s Power Rankings with their immense land mass and constantly growing military. Despite a huge army throughout the entire nation, one could imagine that Boerland is a nice place to live, what with the beaches upon beaches and tropical islands. I, myself am somewhat a closet Boer fan, considering their kindness to the last of our Ashanti brethren. But enough about the Boers, let us resume the battle!"

  narration: "We kick off this part with a nice view of the Blackfoot heartland. Crowfoot’s (Blackfoot) soldiers are not far behind the world’s powerhouses, techwise, with paratroopers beginning to crowd the countryside. If not for the looming Inuit threat to the north, I would go so far as to say that the Blackfoot could have a decent chance at the title if they keep on the way they’re going. A more urgent issue for the buffalo, however, is a stealthily placed Mexican citadel just west of the Great Lakes. While worrisome to the Blackfoot, it may not have been the best idea for Benito Juarez (Mexico), as he now has a diplomatic penalty with Crowfoot, along with nine unmanned tiles ripe for pillaging. And without open borders with the Sioux, it will be a long time before he can transport any units there. \nOn another note, there are a few Australian units digging around in Inuit territory to the northwest. An alliance between these two powers would, in very few circumstances, be a good thing for anyone else in the world. Keep your eyes peeled for signs of an Inuit or Australian plot, because any double DoW would be devastating."

  narration: "A lone Sri Lankan frigate, far from home, faces the tired wrath of the Malian naval remnants, while a Sri Lankan submarine sits under the ice, oblivious to its countrymen’s dire situation. Mali’s declaration of war against Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka), seemed just symbolic before, but maybe Mansa Musa picked the right battle this time."

  narration: "Here we are met with Henry Morgan’s (Bucs) South American holdings following a long, two front war with the Inca and Brazil. The pirate foothold runs deep, and you may notice two carefully placed Buccaneer citadels into Brazilian territory. Enough more of those and we could end up with another fun war on our hands. Meanwhile, a world famous Icelandic rocker visits Manaus for the rock concert of the century."

  narration: "The cold of the deep south doesn’t seem to bother Australian soldiers, as a decent sized portion of their fleet sits in the water around their Antarctican holdings. It’s a strategically good spot to store such a navy if Henry Parkes might ever need to dispatch an offensive against any South American nations, as you can see Chilean water borders off to the east."

  narration: "In support of their aboriginal vassal in Kimbernesia, the Australian parliament deem it necessary to join the war against the aggressive Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka). This certainly spells a bad time for all of Sri Lanka, as the Wobbegong Armada are nothing to sniff at. (Just look at what they have in Indonesia alone!) With this declaration comes the danger that a chain of DoWs could begin, and we all know how devastating that could be. Also worth noting, up to the north, the Blackfoot city of Olongapo has fended off Hawaiian attackers for the most part."

  narration: "As hinted in the last slide of Part 51, Kimberley destroyers have retaken what was rightfully theirs in the island city of Wulungarra. Without a single Sri Lankan unit nearby the city, Jandamarra (Kimberley) will be able to divert all focus to the Sri Lankan core, and with luck, knockout Apollokramabahu Creed. Further to the north you may notice the Norwegian caravel on very low health (possibly even the last Norwegian unit). I’m not sure if Haakon is still at war with anybody, but if so we may very well be witnessing Norway’s final breath being taken."

  narration: "A decently sized portion of the Ice Sheet Fleet is enjoying the other freezing cold part of the Earth. Alongside Henry Parkes’ (Australia) home fleet, Inuit technological dominance is very evident, as the best Australian naval unit looks to be a destroyer. Ekeuhnick’s (Inuit) advanced destroyers seek refuge in Australia in order to repair and get back on the sea. Referring back to the first slide, open borders in Australia are yet another possible sign that the Inuit and the Aussies are becoming chums."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene12.jpg'
  narration: "After losing open borders with the Yakuts, a small chunk of the Boer army is now stranded in international waters, completely trapped by Inuit and Yakut ocean borders. They are not alone, as they join a very lost Armenian(?) rifleman in remote solitude. Also notice the coats of fallout everywhere, making the area near uninhabitable. It’s a sorry sight, and I can only say that Ekeuhnik (Inuit) needs to hire some new people to manage the nuclear weapons."
- scene_number: 13

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene13.jpg'
  narration: "The Afghan cities of Khost, Lahor, and Kandahar are just as engulfed in flames as they were a turn ago, but this time a Mechanized Infantry is in position to take Khost. Paratroopers are just as present as they were before down by Lahor, but the Mongol cannon and crossbow are cutting off any melee units from entering Lahor. There’s really nowhere for any units to move down there, Mongol ones included, so until that mountain range becomes a lot less congested, don’t expect Lahor to fall. The mobile SAM and artillery on the other side of Lahor’s mountains will keep its defenses down until that time comes."

  narration: "The pirate nuclear program continues to grow, and the numerous atomic bombs in Belize seem more or less pointed towards Tulum. We also grimace as a group as a Firaxis fueled Helicopter sits in a boat outside Belize, unable to take off until it reaches land.\nI can’t help but note that the Buccaneers are very obviously the most diverse country in the BR, with cities in South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Florida, Spain, and Africa, and city names like Port-Au-Prince, Sao Luis, and Goergetown. The downfall of Buc culture would be a sad day for all."
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene15.jpg'
  narration: "Here we see the Mexican-Buccaneer border, and Henry Morgan (Bucs) has inherited two of the Maori unique building, the Pa. It boosts military production by 5% in Uxmal, which seems small, but is pretty good for a city that recently took a beating. This shot also shows how the Bucs have little care for land units, their entire military focus is in the sea with their navy. Uxmal, despite belonging to the scary pirates, looks pretty good all in all, and would be a welcome addition to the Mexican Empire were Benito to act on its relative vacancy."
- scene_number: 16

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene16.jpg'
  narration: "Contrary to what I said back on slide 6, a Norwegian Frigate still floats to the east of the Chilean Falkland Islands, accompanied by the remnants of two other eliminated civs. A Zulu worker, almost 200 turns after the annexation of the last Zulu city by the Boers, continues the Zulu culture, just colder. A submarine from a more freshly eliminated civ, the Maori, joins his abandoned brethren in just about the last place in the world anybody would look for them."
- scene_number: 17

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "A Finnish sympathizer, possibly even Kekkonen himself, has the vote to reopen trade to Finland shot down, with the help of six different eliminated civs. Surprisingly, the Mughals don’t appear on the list, though that could just be due to a lack of delegates. In the background, the former Malian buccaneer cities smolder with nuclear fallout, and Haile Selassie (Ethiopia) orders a citadel placed directly in between Utique and the rest of Morocco. Ahmad al-Mansur (Morocco) would do well to send more troops to his eastern holdings, as the Sahara looks very empty right now."
- scene_number: 18

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene18.jpg'
  narration: "The other congressional vote successfully embargoes Brazil. Ten bucs says that Henry Morgan led the charge, though there’s no way to really know. We also see where the Mughals votes were, in favor of embargoing Brazil. I suppose the Mughals aren’t ones to hold grudges, even against the nation that wiped them out. In the background we can see the core of Canada, and they don’t look half bad. A coalition of Blackfoot and Canadian DoWs against the Inuit could possibly go either way. Don’t hold your breath, though.\n \nBefore we move on, take a moment to enjoy Medicine Hat up north."

  narration: "Even more norwegian boats are up closer to their former homeland. However, the unfortunate Privateer-Caravel duo happened to run into the one fleet that they needed to avoid. Now that the Swedes have Norwegian units in their sights, I doubt they will be merciful. The Icelandic green and blue are the only borders in sight, and with Iceland’s open borders to Sweden, the Norwegians have nowhere to run."

  narration: "Our first look at the Hawaiian war, and we are met with a gruesome sight. The formerly 38-pop city of Honolulu has been reduced to 15 by the Chileans, and the Chilean celebration of occupation is surely dampered by the millions who lie dead in the streets. Chilean admirals move away from the city in chaos, trying to remove the horrible images from their minds as they lay siege to Waikiki. The world will remember the day that Honolulu fell, along with Bernardo O’Higgins (Chile), the villain behind it all.\nA local Hawaiian Engineer opines at the loss of the city he was born in '...Is there anything that‘s worth more, than peace and love on the planet Earth?'."

  narration: "We return to the Sri Lanka-Kimberley front, where Colombo looks to be well protected from Jandamarra’s (Kimberley) navy. The few Kimberley ships left lie back to protect Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte from recapture. The war is quiet, for now. However, the Australian navy is moving towards Sri Lanka, however slowly. This war is far from over."
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene22.jpg'
  narration: "An old DoW, long since forgotten by viewers, comes into the spotlight, as the Inuit fleet in Australia has come to odds with a few of Jandamarra’s (Kimberley) loose ships. It’s a very odd situation for Australia, as they provide open borders to both belligerents, and are even helping one in a war, but Parkes (Australia) has not chosen a side."
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene23.jpg'
  narration: "Henry Parkes (Australia) seems to have his hand in everything, as he even has units in Yakutia! He has open borders with Yakutia, who just finished a war with the Inuit, who he has open borders with. It will be interesting to see how this all fits into the Aussie Empire’s master plan of world domination. I also couldn’t help but notice that there’s a Digger in the Yakut city of Ambarchik, how is that possible?"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene24.jpg'
  narration: "We can see here that the Yakut-Sibir war drags on, with the Mongol curtain preventing any melee fighting. Notice the Yakuts now have a Power Armor Infantry, a feat only accomplished by the Inuit and Boers so far. If the Yakuts can start to build their carpet back to what it was early game, they could very well become the powerhouse they once were. Another detail, the Mongols don’t have a single foreign unit within their borders. No open borders to anyone, it seems like Genghis Khan has blocked his entire nation off from the world."
- scene_number: 25

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene25.jpg'
  narration: "With the entrance of Brazil into the Information era comes a view of the entirety of Brazil. Made obvious by their entrance into the Information era, Pedro (Brazil) is not low on tech. With this full view of Brazil, I daresay that a war with either the Bucs or Chile would end in Brazil’s favor, and with the citadels up north, don’t be surprised if Pedro decides to be the aggressor this time."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene26.jpg'
  narration: "Little progress has been made by the Chilean fleet against Waikiki, though it seems they’ve done their best to save the Hawaiians that remain in Honolulu, as the population stays at 15. A Hawaiian recapture of Honolulu is not beyond belief, as there are two lancers within range of the city. If Kamehameha (Hawaii) can manage to retake Honolulu, the only nearby Chilean units are Submarines, which as you know, cannot attack cities. So, Hawaii could keep Honolulu, at least for the time being."
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "The lancers marched into the wreckage of Honolulu. They did not cheer, as one would expect them to upon retaking their capital. The Hawaiians instead trod through the streets, in deafening silence, witnessing the carnage that the murderous Chileans has brought upon their beloved city. Bodies lay in the streets, mothers wept above their unmoving children. \n“What is this, to fight for?” the general bellowed, “If this is the result, we must end this war.”, and the general began to round up the living. “We will evacuate all who we can, and bring them to Hilo. And then, we will protect Hawaii until our last breaths.”\nAnd the soldiers evacuated all that they could before the Blackfoot arrived. They held the city well, but the Blackfoot navy were too powerful. They took the city from the Hawaiians, but by then, Honolulu was nothing but a fresh carcass, a warzone, the ghost of the great city it once was."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene28.jpg'
  narration: "Suddenly, the Kimberley-Inuit war is in the forefront. Ekeuhnik’s (Inuit) open borders with Vietnam and Australia provided a direct route to the Kimberley capital of Makassar, and two Advanced Destroyers are now laying siege to it. Suddenly the war against Sri Lanka is of little importance. The Inuit offensive is even worse than expected, since there’s virtually nowhere for Jandamarra (Kimberley) to send his units through in order to fend off the Inuit ships."
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene29.jpg'
  narration: "Waikiki finally falls to the Chileans, and it’s looking very bleak for Kamehameha (Hawaii). With no cities outside of the Hawaiian islands, there’s nowhere to take refuge if the Chile-Blackfoot coalition manages to finish them off. All of Hawaii seems sad, even the babymaking has come to a halt---none of their cities have grown at all this part. Chile needs to watch out as well. If they get the diplomatic penalty for eliminating Hawaii, it’s open season for Brazil."

  narration: "Wow. You have to give those Sri Lankans credit, they made their way all the way to Austin to make their DoW worth something. Two privateers maneuvered their way through Buccaneer and Inuit land just to take a whack at the Texans. Of course, two privateers will do next to nothing to hurt Texas, but damn, it makes you realize, people really don’t like Sam Houston (Texas). If only Benito (Mexico) could put his head on straight and take Austin, then freedom throughout the world could rest easy."

  narration: "The mind-twisting Henry “Here, have open borders” Parkes of Australia now harbors an atomic bomb in Polynesia. With one atomic bomb, many more are sure to come. The only question is, who will Parkes use it on? Or are the Australian people still too scarred from the Maori bombing of Sydney to use the weapon? I honestly can’t even come close to getting a read on Henry Parkes, he’s that one guy in a casino who check-raises every hand but still has a perfect poker face."
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene32.jpg'
  narration: "Still no progress on the Afghan-Vietnamese border. Lahor is still protected by Mongol peacekeepers, and Kandahar has even begun to heal. Looking at the Atom Bomb that the Trungs (Vietnam) have placed on the front lines, I can’t see even that helping Vietnam too much. Any shot at Khost or Lahor will hit Mongol/Tibetan units, and they can’t have that. Kandahar is the likely target, as it’s protected by units right now, so the Trungs can detonate one tile to the northwest of Kandahar, causing the blast to miss the Vietnamese paratrooper while destroying nine Afghan units and a Champa unit (bonus points!). Then they can send in their paratroopers for an easy capture."

  narration: "Here’s part 52’s obligatory Boer slide. This time we showcase the Boer Giant Death Robots (I count four on this slide), the backbone of this already insane army. There’s a war unit on EVERY SINGLE TILE on this slide. There are a few Ethiopian citadels in between Klerksdorp (great name) and Awasa, and I hope for Haile’s (Ethopia) sake that those Citadels aren’t new, because Ethiopia probably still has a penalty from eliminating the Ayyubids, and a few citadels might tip Paul Kruger (Boers) over the edge."

  narration: "Here we can see that right on cue, Paul Kruger (Boers) has developed the Vertol, another Future Worlds Mod unit. The Vertol is an upgraded helicopter that has 80 attack and requires 1 aluminum to build. I’d say it’s probably an average upgrade, but still, nobody else has it."
- scene_number: 35

  narration: "Kamehameha (Hawaii) has made peace with our favorite Zombie Messiah, Sitting Bull. An appropriate name, as the Sioux sit alone in the middle of North America, yet lead a DoW chain on the Buccaneers, like a bull, I guess. We can see on this slide that Kahului remains undamaged, and the majority of the Chilean navy are submarines, so the Hawaiians could still come out of this war yet. Their last four cities are still substantially sized, they wouldn’t be in the worst shape ever. They’re still down millions of people, though."

  narration: "Well goddamn, Mr. Morgan (Bucs) just can’t keep his finger off the trigger, can he? What cruel irony is this, preparing to fire a nuclear weapon from a city that is still plagued with fallout? Remember, a few parts ago, when the Bucs were the protagonist of the BR? The Hero? Yeah, now they’re just as scary as the Inuit or the Boers. Well, not really, but you get my point."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene38.jpg'
  narration: "It looks like Henry Parkes (Australia) has sent a task force to Honolulu. For what reason, I don’t know, but what I do know, is that there isn’t a single actual ship with fighting capabilities in that fleet. That is eleven great generals. I don’t….I….if there was ever any part of me trying to figure out Henry Parkes before, it’s gone. He just shoved on the flop and now he’s staring straight at me while I decide what to do. I fold, dude. I fold. Take the damn pot. Jesus. Hey, dealer, can I get a new table?"
- scene_number: 39

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part52-scene39.jpg'
  narration: "So, Australia takes Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte. I assume that Sri Lanka had it flipped, and that Ironclad popped in for a quick capture, but let me tell you, that is most definitely not the kind of help that Jandamarra (Kimberley) was looking for. As a result of Australia’s help in the war, the Kimberley have lost a city and gained none. Bravo. Also on this slide, Sam Houston (Texas) gets out of the one war that posed any sort of threat to him, the one with Canada. Now the Texans can enjoy their city state of Austin until Mexico or the Inuit or the Bucs decide that taking Austin is advantageous to them. Sam Houston is the new Chairman Mao, I suppose."

  narration: "Kahului is already in the red, and it’s only been one turn. At this point I do believe it’s entirely possible that Chile will take all of Hawaii (barring Honolulu). A small Blackfoot fleet is coming in up above Mililani, and the Hawaiians’ only defenses are a few carriers and a submarine. In fact, there are way too many Hawaiian carriers, they need some units that will actually attack other units, or they have no chance."

  narration: "Our first real view of Europe this part, and it looks like Sweden is poking the bear. Two citadels straight towards Helsinki, Gustavus Adolphus (Sweden) is a daring man. Finland is a huge power, as represented by their immense army in this slide, and Sweden still has Hakkapeliittas, for Caesar’s sake. I can’t say there are a whole lot of people who don’t want Finland to take over Sweden, but Gustavus is walking the line."

  narration: "A look into Kabasa’s Drone Fighter stockpile shows how absolutely stacked the Boers are in the air as well. This is just one city, look at all the others! Eight other cities with 10 units in them. That’s like, 80 units, and 50ish drones maybe? Drone Fighters are as powerful as X-Coms. Just another thing to add to the world’s long list of worries about the Boers."

  narration: "Following the Yakuts’ example, Korea now has Power Armor Infantry, the fourth civ by my count to have done so. It isn’t a total surprise, given Sejong’s (Korea) civ being science focused, but Korea isn’t the civ that comes to mind when you think powerhouse. This view into the Korean core makes me realise how even Korea is with Vietnam, Yakutia, and Australia. Four technologically similar civs in close proximity, why don’t we lock them in a room and see what happens?"

  narration: "Oh man, I’m not sure what this little dude did to deserve time-out in a lake smack dab in the middle of the outback, but this GWI is not moving, that’s for sure. The poor guy is surrounded by Aussie units. If the unreadable Henry Parkes (Australia) ever decides to turn on Jandamarra (Kimberley) again, this guy’s a casualty. Another note, Australia is still filled with diggers. It seems like they’ve been around forever, I think it’s about time for them to be technologically obsolete."

  narration: "Khost and Lahor sit unperturbed as usual, but Vietnam has made the breakthrough to Kandahar, and as soon as they can act again, that paratrooper is going to take the city. Taking Kandahar won’t help with the captures of Khost and Lahor, but it provides a direct route to Kabul and the rest of Afghanistan. This is the breakthrough that the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) have been so patiently waiting for. Now we can sit back and watch Mirwais Hotak (Afghanistan) scramble to protect his core."

  narration: "Mali enters the Atomic Era, a welcome boost in their current state. If only they’d managed that 40 turns ago, before Henry Morgan (Bucs) bombed three of their cities to shit. Oddly enough, this slide shows that the Bucs and Mali have open borders, with several Malian ships in Tombouctu’s harbor, an infantry in Bamako, and a SAM(?) in Gao. This could be good for Musa (Mali), if he has a new friend in Morgan (Bucs). However, I’d wager that Henry Morgan is more likely to backstab Mansa Musa than help him out."

  narration: "The Hawaiian island of Kahului joins the casualties of the Blackfoot and Chilean war, as the Chilean fleet shift their focus toward Hilo, which is still one of the largest cities on the planet. Four Blackfoot ships grow nearer to the makeshift capital of Mililani, and Kamehameha (Hawaii) can only hope that he can sue for peace successfully before he loses any more cities. A hawaiian armada is nonexistent, with only carriers and a grand total of one privateer left to protect their islands."

  narration: "The Orange Army advances yet again with the new addition of Boer Arsenal Ships. The Arsenal Ship is an upgrade to the missile cruiser, able to carry up to four missiles as well as being able to melee attack with the power of an X-Com. Seeing all of these new Future Worlds units makes me want Agent Em back in Pretoria...to see who may be about to face the Orange wrath."

  narration: "A mutual peace deal with the Inuit will help out Jandamarra (Kimberley) greatly, as he can now focus all units on Sri Lanka. It looks like the Ice Sheet Fleet only managed to take Makassar down by 1 population, but surely the Inuit war was a nuisance for Jandamarra. Now, think about the next slide while I take a minute to enjoy the Australian city Goolarabooloo Millibinyarri."

  narration: "The Sri Lankan defense of Colombo is thus far successful, but Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka) has a considerably smaller fleet than the combined units of Australia and Kimberley. Colombo is just about as low on HP as Sri Lanka can afford for it to be right now. Sri Lanka needs to worry about what will happen if that digger and that artillery can find a foothold on Ceylon, because Galle is very undefended right now."

  narration: "The Yakut-Sibir war rages on in the far north, where both sides continue to expend unit after unit, thousands of fine soldiers dying for no real reason. With only one way in and out of Turinsk, Tygyn Darkhan has nowhere to place his offensive, and so unit after unit clogs the hole and is bombarded by the cities until it perishes. There are no free tiles by the cities to drop paratroopers, the only sea route into Sibir is being blocked by Kekkonen (Finland), and the only units who can pass through mountains are helicopters. That’s all Trigger really needs, two or three helicopter gunships to go and take Beryozovo. That is, if gunships could capture cities.\nIn the meantime, the local Yakutian Communication Arrays blast out the cartoon propaganda show 'Sakha Universe' wherein Sibir nukes the Yakuts so much it causes a massive hole in their region of the world."

  narration: "Shut-in Temüjin (Mongolia) has laid his trust in the one person who could come out on top in a face-off with any other nation, Paul Kruger (Boers). Boer units have spilled out into Mongolia, including a Drone UAV, one of the many Future Worlds units that stock the Boers’ arsenal. As long as Genghis Khan (Mongolia) keeps building citadels into the formerly Chinese Korean land, he’d do good to find more than one ally, preferably one who’s a bit closer to them. The fours citadels right by Shanghai are especially worrisome, and Sejong’s (Korea) eleven air units in Shanghai and Beijing suggest that he’s prepared for a Mongolian offensive, if it comes."

  narration: "The Blackfoot holdings in the northern Pacific ocean look like a juicy target for Ekeuhnik (Inuit), and with his advanced destroyers to Crowfoot’s (Blackfoot) caravels and privateers, resistance would be nearly futile for the Blackfoot. Fortunately for Crowfoot, the Inuit seem disinterested, and are almost chummy with their buffalo neighbors, so such a conquest will have to wait. Until old Nick gets hungry again, that is. Nobody likes Ekeuhnik (Inuit) when he’s hungry, Sam Houston (Texas) can vouch for that.\nAlso on this slide, the next two votes in the United Nations are for luxury bans of crab and sugar. Civ’s handy resource icons let us know that the two Blackfoot islands rely on crab for food, with three sources just in these two cities. The loss of four happiness may not seem much, but these cities may also be losing valuable food."

  narration: "A rare look at the Buccaneer core shows us that the Bucs will also be in bad shape if these votes pass, as sugar is an abundant resource in the Caribbean. The loss of at least 3 sugar tiles would deprive the Bucs of 3 food, 9 gold per turn, and at least 10,000,000 desserts a year. A closer look at the pirate fleet reveals that more than half of it consists of carriers, with few powerful ships surrounding the core. This could be a sign that the Bucs navy isn’t as strong as we thought, or it could just mean that the real navy is stowed away somewhere else in their vast empire (Portugal)."

  narration: "The Blackfoot theme of part 52 continues, as Crowfoot enters the Information Era. The unit count in their territory has grown somewhat since we last saw them on slide 1, and the Inuit land to the north looks eerily barren by comparison. I may sound like a broken record, but a Blackfoot-Inuit war would be highly enjoyable. Even more so if another American civilization like Canada or the Buccaneers decided to join in on the fight. Those inuit citadels down in Corpus Christi make me wonder if Mexico would be the perfect distraction…"

  narration: "Back to the Hawaiian war where a lost Buccaneer trireme that has been hanging ten in Hawaii for millenia observes Bernardo’s (Chile) scattered navy, with submarines making up the majority of the Chilean ships in Hawaiian territory. A damaged escuadra nacional bombards Kailua-Kona alone, and the only incoming Chilean units capable of taking (or damaging) a city are two battleships and a near dead escuadra nacional. The Blackfoot taskforce to the north still hasn’t reached Mililani, and with any luck for Kamehameha (Hawaii), both offensives will grind to a halt very soon. Kamehameha needs to use this time to build more naval units with which to defend the remnants of his once great empire."

  narration: "he Australian offensive of Colombo is in full swing, Colombo is in the red, Galle is in the green, and the siege doesn’t show any signs of stopping. My Rocky reference earlier kind of flopped, because it looks like Rocky called Muhammad Ali in to take over the fight. The Kimberley’s fleet is gone, and Australia have completely taken over this war. With the knowledge that the war is now in good hands, Jandamarra (Kimberley) has shifted his attentions to the ending of all his other wars, and the small island nation will be satisfied with the outcome of the Sri Lankan war. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are very, very dissatisfied with the war---one that they started. Even before Henry Parkes (Australia) got involved, the Sri Lankan navy was already being pummeled. Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka) will be lucky to keep all of his mainland cities."

  narration: "This view of the peaceful side of Afghanistan provides no hope for those subscribed to /r/GraveyardOfEmpires, with few scattered units and a small navy. The Afghans have, until now, been having a decent run in the Battle Royale, having played a part in the downfall of the Timurids, as well as staying on par in the tech game until recently. Their Antarctican colonies will prevent them from being eliminated for a long time, but the full power of the Vietnamese ground troops may cripple them enough to join the list of “doomed” civilizations."

  narration: "In the former Hunnic territories, it isn’t easy to distinguish between the Finnish and Siberian territories, what with the dozens of Finnish paratroopers enjoying vacation in the tropical (/s) Siberian southwest. Not a lot of action from these two top-ten civs recently. Kekkonen (Finland) did finish off the Mughals not too long ago, but Kuchum Khan (Sibir) has been very quiet for a long long time (if you discount the war without progress with Yakutia). We can only hope that this long stretch of peace in Sibir will end with an invasion of Mongolia, or a fun backstab of Urho (Finland), or at least a quick conquest of lowly Armenia or the U.S.S.R. On the bright side, Sibir’s inactivity allows for the remaining Romans to enjoy a nice swim in the Black Sea."

  narration: "Seamus stood on the mast of his boat, gazing out at the desert sunset that lay before him. It was a beautiful sight: a pink and orange sky, no clouds at all, not another human being for miles. Seamus smiled as he finished off his pint. “It’s just like Ireland.” he sighed to himself. Of course, it was nothing like Ireland, but Seamus didn’t know that. All Seamus knew about Ireland came from the stories that his father told him, and his grandfather before that. Of course, they didn’t know anything about Ireland either, because all they knew about Ireland came from the stories that they’d heard, for no Irishman had lived in Ireland for centuries. Seamus pulled a guinness out of the cooler beside him. He took a swig, and then yelled, to nobody in particular, “Once a scout, always a scout!”. Seamus listened as his voice echoed off the mountains behind him."

  narration: "Lord Nebuchadnezzar’s faithful servant Ishtar transmits home to the sub with news of a Yakut plot against the Blackfoot. It’s good of Ishtar to finally report back to us, but any Yakut-Blackfoot war isn’t likely to have much of an outcome, given Yakutia’s one tile passageway into the open ocean, and the Australian units that are blocking the way. Off to the right of the slide we can see that a Hawaiian carrier made its way up to Akhaiyikokakinik, and even done some damage to the Blackfoot privateers surrounding it. Whether or not we get another look at Hawaii before the end of this part, I think it’s safe to say that Hawaiian resistance is wearing quite thin."

  narration: "Colombo’s last defenses are falling, as its health is almost all gone. The placement of a Finnish machine gun, a Sri Lankan battleship, and a Sri Lankan artillery in front of the city will keep it alive for at least one more turn, but the entrance of the Sri Lankan capital into Henry Parkes’ (Australia) maritime empire is imminent. Galle, Colombo’s twin city, is still holding strong for the time being, but it won’t be too long before the Wobbegong sweep over Galle, too. Some Kimberley naval units have snuck into the middle of the armada after all, so it’s not beyond belief that a Kimberley battleship could sail in and snipe Colombo out from under Parkes’ nose."

  narration: "Here we have arrived at the last slide before InfoAddict takes over the spotlight, and the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) have yet to capture Kandahar, despite their breakthrough a few turns ago. Taking a look at the Siberian citadel next to Lahor and the infantry by Khost, I can’t help but wonder if maybe Kuchum Khan (Sibir) might declare war on Mirwais Hotak (Afghanistan) and take Lahor and Khost for himself. It wouldn’t take much, just one infantry to walk into Khost and one helicopter gunship to stroll into Lahor. Meanwhile, the Roman ballista is enjoying the springtime in a lake right along the Judaism-Akattu religion border, its men flinging rocks into the shimmering water. “POW!” says Caecilius, “Take that, Leonidas! That’ll teach you to mess with the Roman Empire!” He laughs maniacally, until his laughter fades, and then morphs into cries of sorrow for his lost homeland."

The Inuit sit at 80, and Tygyn Darkhan (Yakutia), with his Power Armor Infantry, is nine whole techs behind the Inuit. He must be rushing military tech, because he was third leader to possess such a unit. Sri Lanka hides just off the list, only two techs behind the civilization that may very well take their capital next part, and Sweden’s 66 techs make one wonder why on earth Gustavus still has at least a dozen Hakkapeliittas nearby Stockholm."

However, it’s not as surprising as you may think, given Kekkonen’s UA, which takes a quarter of allied civs’ happiness and uses it as culture. The bonus is doubled if the other civ has another ideology. I’m not sure what Kekkonen’s ideology is, but even without the double that’s a huge boost on culture. Sri Lanka, in seventh, is a surprise, as well as Afghanistan in eighth."

Missionaries are having trouble finding people accepting to religious beliefs down in the harsh climates of Antarctica, and it looks like the Ayyubid Party Prophet was able to balance Islam and Judaism enough in Dvin for religious controversy to erupt.\n \nAnyhow, this is the last stop on the Battle Royale Express, when your name is called kindly come get your weapon and leave!
