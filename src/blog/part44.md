  narration: "Welcome back to The Official /r/Civ 60+ Civ Battle Royale Part 44! I\u2019m /u/elephantofdoom, fan of Civ\u2019s 4 and 5, and I am your narrator for this part! For those of us just joining us, or those who just need a refreshes, last time there was much excitement, as the Koreans have launched a successful air invasion of Vietnam, Ethiopia did a complete 180 on their war record and invaded Carthage, Sparta continues to hold their ground and more! I am a first time narrator, so I would just like to thank TPang for giving me the chance to do this!\nTitlecard this week by /u/Cadellinman - join us over on /r/civbattleroyale for OC and propaganda like this daily!"

  narration: "Here is a look at the fantastic city map, courtesy of /u/LacsiraxAriscal. Before we move on, I have to mention something some of you may not be aware of. /u/LacsiraxAriscal does not make these maps from scratch, rather he bases them off of the annals of the world maps that have been made by /u/SylonL. However, recently /u/SylonL has had to retire due to real life concerns. Fortunately, /u/Malssistra has taken up the mantel and prevented us from losing these maps. Thank you for continuing this project, and I hope /u/SylonL does well in whatever he needs to get done!"

  narration: "We begin where we left off in North Africa, where Ethiopia is continuing their blitz of Carthaginian Egypt. For a civilization that has had a very mediocre war record in the past, they are completely tearing up what remains of the Eastern Carthaginian forces. Already they are surrounding Alexandria, and their massive artillery division has enough firepower to flatten the city to the ground. The only problem they may have is they are light on melee units in the area, and their massive blob of artillery may make moving reinforcements north difficult.  Fortunately for Haile Selassie, Hannibal is sending what little troops he has left to attack the enclave of Mampong, forgetting that that city is impossible for anyone to capture. Meanwhile, the last Ayyubid general orders his half-strength crossbowman and worker to recapture Zabid.\nOf note: the Boers have a lot of modern armor in the area."

  narration: "And here we see The Inuit on top after they completely crushed Texas, a previous top 20 power! The only Civ that can project as much power as them at this point are the Boers, who will certainly be tied with them neck and neck until one comes out on top! For now, we must wait and see, and get to watch texas die in the process."

  narration: "Moving on to the most exciting new war, the long awaited fight between Australia and New Zealand over who has to change their flag. Most viewers expect a crushing Australian victory, after the Maori failed to take advantage of the Australians when they were fighting in the west, but right now it appears the brown and beige navy of\nTe Rauparaha has the upper hand. Parkes, however, has the means to wage a long war, and has already captured Pukekura. What is more worrisome for the Maori is that Pukekura only lost 8 citizens when it was captured, showing the massive influence Australia has over them. If they do not recapture large cities quickly, they will be both easier for Australia to defend, and will be able to supply more gold and production to help the enemy war machine."

  narration: "To the north, in Polynesia the Wobblygong, or the Waillingsong, or the Willytounge armada or whatever it is called is facing off against a smaller but technologically equal force of Maori. The slide reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean with all of the privateers, and I assume Jack Sparrow is on the lone Buccaneer Corsair. The \u2018stralians have already captured a couple of cities and are close to capturing a few more, but the Maori have a superior air force in the area."

  narration: "The fierce tribesmen have recaptured Pukekura, but it has lost most of its population. Expect it to flip several more times before this part is over. To the south, a small fleet of privateers and caravels attempt to capture the Australian capitol of Sydney, but they can barely put a dent in it."

  narration: "Anawrahta (Burma) must be banging his head on a wall now. Vietnam has overrun his nation, and now the Champa have more forces in his borders than he does. Only the frustrating lack of melee units from Vietnam had been keeping him safe, and now the Trung sisters have sent an AA gun, a lancer and a paratrooper to make sure the job is done properly this time.\nTo the west, the Mughals appear to have remembered they are at war with Sri Lanka, and have the city of Anuradhapura (way too many a\u2019s there) surrounded. Their units are weak, and they have a tiny navy, but they do have a good mix of melee units and archers, and their navy boasts submarines, so they have a chance."

  narration: "In the Persian Gulf, the last of the Huns and Timurids stare at the strange moose-men who fell from the sky and took a Sri Lankan city from the Arabians. It seems that Finland has secured Batticaloa, and due to their carpet forcing units to whomever they have open borders with, in this case Afghanistan, they will continue to be reinforced. (Does anyone else find it odd that rather than being embarked, extra units are teleported far across the globe?)"

  narration: "We move to the Amazon basin to find the Brazilians have managed to move a surprisingly large force to retake their cities from the pirates.  But be warned, Pedro, as an Irish scouts looks on, the Buccaneers have finally moved their massive navy towards Brazil, like a monster preparing to engulf its prey. Much pillaging, raping, burning, drinking, looting, raiding, singing and booty contests shall follow.\nOne more thing before we move on: I would just like to point out how well Brazil has managed its workers, with almost every tile improved. Many nations, even large ones like Finland or the Boers, have large patches of unimproved land right in their core, next to their older cities, and yet the Brazilians have managed to improve rough terrain far away from Rio."

  narration: "Sibir continues to build a carpet, though it is still much less dense than the Finns. The Finns, despite having SAM\u2019s and rocket artillery are still using great war infantry and cavalry however, so things may be a bit more balanced than they appear. Sibir\u2019s problem is while they are superior to every other nation they border, they are the only top 4 major power that is not only surrounded, but is surrounded by nations with fairly large armies, meaning if they try to attack one of their neighbors, the others will be able to attack them while they are weak. Of course, the Maori failed to take advantage of this vs. the Australians a few parts ago, and the British and French forgot this IRL in 1939 when the Germans were busy in Poland, so who knows."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene13.jpg'
  narration: "Here we see the Vietnamese have stalled the Korean offensive, securing Vigan and holding the line at Tianjin. While the Koreans still have a larger local force, their carpet is starting to wear thin, and with the Burma war winding down, the Trung sisters will be able to send more reinforcements north. The Vietnamese could probably be doing much better, but their sizable air force appears to be skipping enemy units in favor of bombing cities with no melee units nearby. Also worth noting, the Koreans have helicopters."

  narration: "We return to the Indian Ocean, where as an Ayyubid galley observes, the Champa army is preventing the Vietnamese troops from attacking Rangoon from the east. To the south, six Siberian scouts take turns looking into a pair of binoculars to see what is going on."
- scene_number: 15

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene15.jpg'
  narration: "The Koreans bring Tianjin to the red, which is a problem for Vietnam, as it is a large city containing five air units, and the Trung sisters only have a lancer to recapture it. A few miles west, a Korean gunship learns about hubris when it runs straight into an enemy SAM unit."

  narration: "Peace comes to Sweden, as their bloody war with Vietnam comes to an end. Boer peacekeepers ensure the terms of the truce are met, with the Swedes offering the Trung sisters a mansion full of blonde models and reasonably priced furniture (some assembly required). Okay, seriously Sweden, look at Brazil. You have many unimproved tiles within range of your capitol for God\u2019s sake. Get it together! And please, found a city in Denmark, that tile north of the forest next to the river seems perfect.\nSenshi‘s Note: I want to see this mansion fanart now ;) ;) ;) (don‘t ask why I sometimes get notes)"

  narration: "The war in Polynesia rages on as the Oombagoomba fleet takes two more cities. The Maori should be worried, two of their larger cities are in danger, and they both contain large stacks of much needed planes."
- scene_number: 19

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "In a surprising move, the Inuit not only let Texas live, but let them keep Austin too! They do get Albany in the peace treaty, though. Looking at this is just sad. Only a couple of weeks ago, Texas was one of the most powerful civilizations in the game, and now they are reduced to about a dozen units and two cities, cut off from each other. Conquered by a civilization they only shared a fringe water border with. All of the world will fear the White Walkers now, and with no in the same hemisphere possessing an army large and advanced enough to challenge them, they will exert complete dominance over what remains of Texas, Canada, Mexico and the Blackfoot. Citizens of these nations will be required to sew patches on the seats of their pants saying \u201cproperty of a polar bear\u201d and must prepare themselves for the day they will be forced to suck on an ice zombie\u2019s icicle.\nAlso, I would like to mention that it appears TPang has installed a mod fixing the glitch where helicopters would embark instead of floating over the water. Neat."

  narration: "Back in Brazil, the Buccaneer fleet appears to be taking its time to sail down the coast, as the last of the pirate land forces are forced out of the north. Morgan appears to be concentrating his forces near Machu, perhaps preparing to attack east and cut off the Brazilian supply lines?\nAlso worth mentioning: the Inca had cut down most of the jungle on their side of the border, but Brazil kept it up to build camps on theirs. I think that\u2019s pretty cool, how about you?"

  narration: "The Spartan navy reports to Leonidas that the coastline of North Africa is turning a darker shade of green. When he is told his new neighbors are also red he remarks \u201cAhh! A fellow warrior!\u201d and sends Haile Selassie a letter congratulating him on his progress vs. the Spartans old rival Hannibal, the dishonorable thief who stole southern Italy from him years ago. The Ethiopians look up the Romans, and discover that in an alternate universe, the Romans wiped out the Carthaginians. Impressed, they send the last Roman troops in Central Asia an invitation to join their army and defeat the elephants once and for all. But the Romans refuse the offer, mentioning something about spaghetti falling out of their pockets. Furious, the Ethiopians plot with the Keks to take out the last of the Romans."

  narration: "The Maori have had a surprising success against the Australians, forcing the Wangbong fleet out of much of Polynesia. The Australians seem to be on the defense in the south, with a minor skirmish near Brisbane interrupting famed game critic Yahtzee Croshaw as he works on his review of the Battle Royale:\nIdiotic ai, boring omnipresent narration and a pants on head stupid story are what keep me from enjoying this otherwise average display of reverse imperialism. Some people might say watching the ai being disappointing is part of the charm, but that excuse didn\u2019t seem to work with my parents!"

(I‘m so happy)\nOk. so. It appears that while the Yakutia have  a slight advantage in the east, they are lacking in land units and the Ice fleet will be arriving shortly.\nSenshi‘s Note: This isn‘t even the exciting slide >:( >:( >:("

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene25.jpg'
  narration: "To the North we see the Yakutia version of the Ice fleet, a terrifying modern fleet of destroyers, battleships and carriers. If it were located anywhere else in the world it would be one of the most powerful fleets in the game. Unfortunately for the Yakuts, a permanent group of icebergs means the fleet only has two tiles to slowly move through."

  narration: "Back to the Korean war, Vietnam suffers a severe blow when they lose Tianjin. That area of China, around the Yangtze river, was home to five of Vietnam‘s largest industrial cities, and now they only have one of them left. Hai Phong is a large city with 5 manufactories, losing it will be a crushing blow, but it seems the Trung sisters can only throw more machine guns at the Korean artillery, infantry, paratroopers, and cavalry? Seriously Sejong, get some oil!"

  narration: "I\u2019ll give the Inca this: they refuse to let Chile hold onto the city of Tiwanaku. Despite an overwhelming Chilean force, they keep taking it back. Bernardo needs to hold onto this city to show he gained something from all this fighting, fighting that in the end cost him a city and took Buenos Aires, once his largest city, to a puppeted city of 1."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene29.jpg'
  narration: "Back in Africa, we see Hannibal has still not been informed that Mampong has a special mod installed that says \u201cunless you are the Boers, this city can only change ownership via stupid peace treaties\u201d. As he still thinks he has a shot at capturing it, he opts to send his entire supply of riflemen south instead of stopping the Ethiopian advance. Seeing this, Haile Selassie gets confident and plans to continue marching on Mali once Ethiopia is crushed. I assume the Boers approve, it just means one less declaration of war for Kruger to sign in the future."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene30.jpg'
  narration: "Back to Europe, where it appears the war has stalled on account of the Boars having contest in the area to see how many of their paratroopers can land in the area before they get shot down by their SAM batteries. Finland is clearly tired of this war, and plots to capture the rest of what was once Byzantium from the Spartans."

  narration: "Off the coast of Eastern Africa, the Boers have developed advanced destroyers, a new unit from the Future Worlds mod! They are an upgraded form of destroyer with a movement of 8, a strength of 80 and boast 100 interception, meaning anyone who dares to attack the Orange Fleet via air will be in for a nasty surprise."

  narration: "Burma is on its last legs. It is down to a single city, and its military consists of a cannon and two riflemen. Fortunately for them, Vietnam is lacking in units that can actually capture cities, and the Champa are totally cockblocking- er, I mean capture blocking the Vietnamese to the east."
- scene_number: 33

  narration: "In the east, the Yakuts have captured one Inuit city and are about to capture another, giving them access to the Pacific Ocean. The Inuit appear to have been too eager to declare war, and have yet to move the bulk of their forces west. Due to the nature of the geography here, with narrow sea lanes, mountains blocking troop movement and  the general isolated nature of the region, I expect the size advantage of the Inuit to only matter if this war carries on for a long time."
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part44-scene34.jpg'
  narration: "The Inuit push back, recapturing Sendai and creating a perimeter around the battered city of Wotjulum. The Yakuts have a massive air superiority however, as well as an artillery brigade on the island of Sakhalin, so don\u2019t expect the Inuit to advance much further right now. Currently Iglook is damaged but still safe. Last war it was a key city, allowing its controller to move naval units into enemy waters safely, so expect it to be the city of most interest this war."

  narration: "Back to Australia, which is currently holding strong against a force of Maori units harassing their eastern core cities. Right now the Maori are unable to take any cities but are holding onto their really long-named city of Whan- HOLD ON A SECOND! UH-OH, WE HAVE TWO ATOMIC BOMBS IN RANGE OF THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL! WILL THE MADMAN USE THEM?\nWell, this explains the Australians hesitation to send more forces to the Maori core. The AI is very hesitant to use nukes as they carry a massive diplomatic penalty, but they also make enemy AI afraid to go to war. Will they matter here? We shall see."

  narration: "In the north, the Maori have secured the eastern and southern islands, but they are in danger of losing two large cities, Rangiriri and Waitangi. Important to note is the Maori have battleships but the Australians only have ironclads, so the Bobsgone fleet lacks total dominance."

  narration: "Another look at South Africa Shows the Boers are now in possession of bombs, jet fighters and a half obsolete, half terrifyingly advanced navy. Also, despite their being many tiles unimproved within their borders, they appear to have embarked their entire workforce on some sort of corporate cruise for teambuilding exercises."

  narration: "Back to the Cold War, where the Inuit seem to be launching some minor incursions into Yakutia territory. Despite the Yakuts having a large air force, it is out of date and bombing cities instead of units. The Inuit have moved a large amount of Rocket artillery into the area, and the Yakuts only have some AA guns, Gatling guns and some artillery to fight back."

  narration: "The Maori have somehow obtained a digger unit. Can privateers steal embarked melee units? My guess is the diggers where convinced to switch sides due to the Maori promising to teach them fabulous tribal war dances under a strange green glowing light.\nTPang‘s note: It‘s the Maori UA which reads as follows - (Mana of Tumatauenga) Every time an enemy unit is defeated in battle, receive 25% of the Production cost towards that unit in the Capital. Melee Units lower the Combat Strength of adjacent enemy units."

  narration: "The Keks realize that they have a juicy target right next to them, and prepare for war. Sweden is an overrated power in my opinion, much like Sparta and Carthage were. Sure they had success fighting bottom tier nation in their areas, but put them against a strong opponent and they buckle like they tried to win a drinking contest against an Australian digger. The Swedes do have a large navy in the area, but the Finns can drop paratroopers behind the fleet, and they are desperate for some of that oil the Swedes must have. Despite being a top 5 civilization with a very advanced army, the Finns lack an air force or tanks, and either need to wait for aluminum modern units or take oil while the Swedes are busy in the south."

  narration: "Deciding a war against a superior foe is not enough, the Spartans declare war on Hannibal, knowing all will be fine as long as Hawaii has their backs. A war vs. Carthage would normally be a good idea, if the Spartans weren\u2019t already losing a war, but hey, their navy is just sitting there, maybe this will at least save them some money on naval unit upkeep costs."

  narration: "The Wobblegobble fleet has moved to the north for now, focusing on the large city of Waittangi. The Maori have done a fine job defending themselves so far, but now that they have nuked the Australian capital, they have no hope of a peace deal. They must win and force a truce on the Australians, or be annihilated. (Does anyone else find it weird that the city is spelled capital but the building where a government is based is spelled capitol?)"

  narration: "The Inuit have wasted little time, annexing several Texan cities. If it wasn‘t for damaged cities giving away the recent war, I would say this looked like a peaceful place, as there is a lack of units on this slide, which means the Buccs have moved their fleet somewhere."

  narration: "And so we must press F to pay our respects to Anawrahta and the Burma, who were defeated by the Trung sisters on turn 452. For most of the game Burma was in an awkward place. The rough terrain prevented them from interacting with their neighbors, and they managed to lose a few cities from peace treaties. Towards the end, they managed to briefly capture some cities, and it was probably for the best that they went out on a high note.\nWell, now that this annoyance is finished, the Trung Sisters can finally move their forces north to deal with the Koreans. It they have a lot of paratroopers in the area, and paratroopers are just the unit they need to turn the tide up north.\nSenshi‘s Note: Farewell, old friends :,)"

We poked our heads outside the building to see we were not in Sydney anymore. It appears we have been teleported to some mythical land where elves and dwarves roam free. At least the flag is the same.'\nTPang‘s note: Look what they‘re constructing on the outskirts of Ruapekapeka..."

The war was a big win for Korea, who now control several key cities with high production. They did not, however, secure an oil supply. The Trung Sisters may have lost, but Vietnam is not much weaker than it was at the start. The lost cities are balanced out by their gains in the south, and they will be ready next time to recapture them."

Poor Incans, the entire game the other four nations in South America bullied them, and they held out for a long time.

For the most part, these are expected, though it is worth noting that there are less tiny civs as there used to be, as they have been culled out, and now some empires previously considered to be middle powers are on the last slide. Remember, as civs get cut off, 20 is now the middle point, not 30, and civs that may have previously been seen as somewhat powerful are now the sick men of the world."

Well, it has been an exciting part"
