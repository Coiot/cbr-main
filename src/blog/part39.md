  narration: "Hey everyone, welcome to another edition of the Seerc- I mean Civ Battle Royale, Mark II! I am your narrator, /u/KnightofNi (whom you may know by the name of ePiKnight pretty much anywhere outside of Reddit), and I am stoked to bring you part #39, especially with all the fireworks that appeared last time!\nCredits go to /u/MarmotaBobac for this amazing titlecard image!"

  narration: "Check out the map after part 38, and commend our mapmakers /u/SylonL and /u/LacsiraxAriscal (and all of their helpers) for a job well done! As was mentioned on /r/civbattleroyale earlier this week, a staggering 67 total cities flipped over the course of the last part (press F to pay respects), by far the most in the history of the Battle Royale, so they had their work cut out for them."

  narration: "It is hard to imagine anyone other than the Boer powerhouse sitting atop the power rankings once again. Depending on how the grand war in the Pacific goes though, we may end up with another challenger once again…\nYou can find all the Power Rankings of Part 38 here: http://imgur.com/a/olefC/layout/horizontal#0"

  narration: "Speaking of which, we begin with a nice shot of southern Australia, where the Wobbegong and Kimberley armadas are squaring off. Unsurprisingly, the central Kimberley cities are taking significant damage, but the Red Fort‘s bonus is meant for situations like these. If the Kimberley can pull more Destroyers around (see left edge of the screen), they will likely be able to hold off the Aussie naval invasion. Those land units are scary though, especially escorted by Bob Hawke. Why they‘re taking a leader to the front lines is something only the Aussie AI knows…"

  narration: "Medan and Geelong have already flipped - something these cities in modern day Indonesia will likely do many, many times this part. Both powers have huge air forces shelling all fronts, so regardless of who comes out on top, if anyone, all sides will take terrible, terrible damage. Could this be the opportunity for the Maori, Hawaii, or even Sri Lanka to make some serious ground?"
- scene_number: 06

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene06.jpg'
  narration: "And here we have the northern front. Cebu is about to flip, Iloilo has taken damage, and Manila seems firmly Aussie… for now. There are a few Blackfoot peacekeepers in the area though, taking away valuable surface area for ships to hang out in.\n \nWorth noting that Maria the Lazy (Portugal) denounced the Inuit. Don‘t you have enough problems back at home, Maria?"
- scene_number: 07

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene07.jpg'
  narration: "A slightly different view of the same region, centering more on the former Champan cities. Don‘t get caught up in the Aussie/Viet/Kimberley war hype to forget that the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) are still at war with Champa, who can absolutely take a nice bite out of some of those unprotected embarked units.\n \nAlso in the slide is the knowledge that Benito Juarez (Mexico) has reached the modern era! If he has oil, this means planes are likely quick to follow."
- scene_number: 08
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene08.jpg'
  narration: "Speaking of Maria, she loses Rome back to Sparta. The backdoor Privateer capture works wonders for the second time in less than five turns, and with only a Privateer and a Galleass even able to deal damage to the city, it looks to be likely to stay Sparta for a while.\n \nThat being said, Sparta is getting their teeth kicked in everywhere else. Gustavus Adolphus (Sweden) is stomping through the formerly Spartan territories in eastern europe - the former Byzantine cities that make up the Spartan core could be quick to follow. Personally, this is one of the most surprising wars yet. Sweden and Sparta were fairly close before the war, but the Regal Lions have made the Spartans look like roadkill."

  narration: "Wow, look at that Buccaneer fleet. The pirates have absolute regional supremacy in terms of navy - in a region that is thousands of miles from their capital. They are now sporting Battleships (which I‘d personally rather be planes) and modern Infantry and could pick literally any nearby civ, save perhaps Iceland, to plow through next. Morocco seems nice and juicy, especially for that Great Lighthouse in Marrakech."
- scene_number: 10

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene10.jpg'
  narration: "Since the last shot of the winter war between the Inuit and Canada/Texas, I believe four cities have flipped (Charlottetown) or fallen back into Canadian hands (Victoria, St. Catharines, Kiyaksa). Yankton is back in Inuit hands, but one has to question whether the Inuit have bitten off more than they can chew. All of this being said, they have already claimed seven cities off of Canada, a very nice outcome to any war. But when you‘ve got Infantry against Riflemen, you expect more."
- scene_number: 11

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene11.jpg'
  narration: "In a rare show of competence (or just a classic show of how having planes gives you a ridiculous edge), Brazil is brutalizing Argentina. If it weren‘t for the fact that La Rioja is deep in the Andean mountains, I‘d say Argentina might be gone before this part is over. They‘re desperately making peace with enemies all over the world, but the one looming threat will not go away."
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene12.jpg'
  narration: "Bidyadanga has already flipped once and will likely do so at least once more. This outdated Wobbegong Armada is fairly low on health though - planes plus Destroyers will make quick work of all these Privateers. However, they have to find a way to stabilize the ground forces, and using Pikemen is NOT the solution."
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene13.jpg'
  narration: "Kimberley is coming out ahead in the Indonesian isles, taking back Medan and having a gigantic naval presence. However, they need their core far more than they need these 1 pop fringe cities…"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene14.jpg'
  narration: "Speaking of their core, here‘s a good shot at the huge number of Aussie melee units rolling across the Outback. Kimberley does seem to have similar tech for their ground units, sporting Great War Infantry here, but they just need more. Again, the red fort will be crucial here to keeping Kimberley‘s cities in their hands."
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene15.jpg'
  narration: "Vietnam uses the tried and true tactic of throwing a Great Musician at an opposing force, in an early form of 'Creedbombing'. One can only imagine this musician is Scott Stapp himself. In other news, Cebu has fallen to Australia, but their navy is beginning to look rather thin. There are almost as many Blackfoot units in this slide as Aussie ones - where are they going?"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene16.jpg'
  narration: "Sparta finally shows some teeth and flips Ohrid back to their side, but there are so many more Swedish ground units here than there are Spartan it will likely flip back in short order. At the same time, Maria looks like she might be able to flip Rome once again, creating yet another distraction for Leonidas (Sparta). Speaking of distractions, that’s a nice army you‘ve got there, Napoleon. Ever going to decide to use it?"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "Buccanneer Infantry fighting against Portuguese Galleasses seems like a microcosm of this war. Maria is about to find herself on the Galleria of Dedness at the hands of a foe who‘s capital is across the world. I‘d say I was surprised, but this IS Maria the Lazy we‘re talking about…"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene18.jpg'
  narration: "Back to the outback, where Bidyadanga flips once again. Kunmunya is in the deep red, and somehow Junjuwa is completely untouched, though it has been citadeled into oblivion. Where are all of your planes, Jandamarra (Kimberley)?"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "None of those planes are over here, but there is a superior naval force instead. Destroyers against Privateers and Caravels is a clear edge, and it looks as if Jandamarra is shuttling down more ships from Indonesia to help out. They‘ve got a tall road ahead of them, but it is very interesting how the grand Wobbegong Armada is outmatched while the Aussie ground invasion forces are the ones carrying the day."
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene20.jpg'
  narration: "Cebu falls, and Vietnam also looks extremely thin in terms of their available units. They have only a very small handful of planes, and while Viet Congs are fantastic at dealing with units and moving through jungles, don‘t forget that they can‘t capture cities. They do appear to have horses though, so both Lancers and Cavalry can do this job as well as the melee naval vessels.\n \n(eventually some narrator will stop harping on this, but it is so damn important!)"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene21.jpg'
  narration: "Suddenly, out of absolutely nowhere, a massive Kimberlalian army sprouts of the ground! The Australalians looked absolutely dominant on the ground just a few slides ago, but now all of that is being called into question by this wave of Great War Infantry that crawled out of the sand. On top of that, the Kimberley navy is absolutely dominating the Wobbegong. Destroyers absolutely wreck Caravels, Privateers, and Frigates, and that is the matchup that we see prominently down by the minimap. That ring of Caravels does absolutely nothing against that lone Destroyer, holding out like a champ.\n \nIn other news, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). I made it through 20 slides, but I couldn‘t help myself.\n \nAlso, apparently we‘re back in 4000 BC. What the actual f@#k. TPANG CAN INTO TIME TRAVEL.\nTPang‘s note: ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \nTPang‘s second note:Also, the World Congress passed the vote to Embargo Australia."

  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene22.jpg'
  narration: "Even more gainz here for Kimberley, taking Orange while not losing any of their own cities. Weren‘t there supposed to be submarines in the Wobbegong Armada? If so, where are they? That‘s about the only unit I can see turning the tides here other than even more planes. This really is an impressive turn-around by Jandamarra. We‘ll see if he can keep it up."
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene23.jpg'
  narration: "Here we have both fronts of the Inuit wars of North America. The Ice Sheet Fleet isn‘t quite doing its job in holding Victoria, but they do seem to have a firm grasp on Oyuhpe, Yankton is besieged by Cannons but only has one melee unit in the vicinity, and Charlottetown and Regina are both likely to fall this turn (see that it is currently the Inuit‘s turn that is processing). Canada‘s core is beginning to take damage from the Snowstorm Air Force - if the Inuits can break through Quebec City decisively, I fear it is all over for Lester B. Pearson (Canada)."
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene24.jpg'
  narration: "A quick look at the relatively quiet north-eastern front of the Inuit wars. These frigid cities have flipped a couple times thus far, but are in control of Canada for now. A Buccaneer Corsair takes full advantage of its unique ability to ignore enemy borders and takes a quick peek at another extremely successful war. The minimap shows that the Buccs have not taken the rest of Iberia as of yet, but perhaps we shall see soon."
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene25.jpg'
  narration: "Remember that time when Argentina had cities and was relevant? Me either. What is for certain now is that they are down to one city deep in the heart of the Andes. Thanks to planes, Pedro (Brazil) can go after the city if he so chooses, but it may not be worth the 10x warmonger penalty to do so. Eva Peron (Argentina) is on her deathbed, and considering half of her land is mountains, she might as well be dead.\n \nIn other news, it appears that Chile has submarines? They continue to hold Vitcos, while the Inuit take four cities with the turn that was resolving in the previous slide (Charlottetown, Regina, Victoria, and Sarnia)."
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene26.jpg'
  narration: "Here‘s a shot of the suddenly icy blue cities all across North America. Quebec City is down to 0 health with a couple melee units staring it down, and a nice Bazooka (!!!) stares at the Canadian forces menacingly. Of course, this begs the question… NUKES???? *heavy breathing*"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "There‘s a lot going on in this slide, so I‘ll go through everything briefly:\n    1. Ohrid is back in Swedish hands, while Cumae is taking damage (from planes, most likely).\n    2. Rome is in the deep red, but none of Maria‘s units seem to be nearby.\n    3. This may be the last shot of Israel we see in this Battle Royale. Prepare your Fs.\n    4. The Ayyubids are somehow still hanging on against a vastly superior force in both tech and size. /u/ProletariatCossack, you are badly needed in the Carthaginian (Carthaginalian?) camp, ASAP."
- scene_number: 28

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene28.jpg'
  narration: "As a pile of Stalin‘s ships get deposited in the Mediterranean Sea (presumably from the closing of borders), the Buccs continue their charge at Coimbra, the current seat of Maria the Lazy. She stares wistfully out the window, admiring the effort of the Henry Morgan (Buccs), vowing to do the same with the Portuguese.\n \n'Tomorrow,' she says.\n \nIn other news, Vitcos flips back to the Inca."
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene29.jpg'
  narration: "Despite Mexico recently entering the modern era, Kamehameha (Hawaii) is not to be deterred, and redoubles his efforts to take Merida back into the Hawaiian empire. Considering how few Mexican ships there are (there are almost as many Inuit ships on this slide as there are Mexican ones) and how few melee units appear to be in Benito‘s empire, this future city capture could stick for a while."
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene30.jpg'
  narration: "Maria has been ejected completely from Iberia, having only the two 1-tile island cities of Goa and Funchal and the former Nazi city of Cologne left in their empire. It is hard to imagine any of these cities falling to the Buccs in this war, but then again, who really imagined that Henry Morgan would take Porto and Coimbra?"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene31.jpg'
  narration: "The Buccs smell blood in the water, abusing their Corsair‘s ability to pay Cologne a visit. I wonder what Iceland, Napoleon, and Gustavus are thinking right now. Cologne is literally free for the taking for anyone who wants it, and is staring three empires in the face. Instead, the Buccs are likely to be the one to steal it. From halfway across the world. AIs FailFish…"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene32.jpg'
  narration: "And we go back to the East Indies for some more warring action (I hope you guys keeping track of the city flips are having fun)! Henry Parkes (Australia) takes four cities off of the Kimberley (Orange, Milijiddee, Kandiwal, and Ardyaloon), but that doesn‘t look it is going to last. Considering how many ships, GWIs, and planes Jandamarra has in the region, there‘s going to be a lot of flipping going on here. Kandiwal might go from 20+ pop to 1 in this part though, which is a big hit to whoever ends up with it at the end."
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene33.jpg'
  narration: "The Aussie air force has been busy, bombing Vigan down to the red and hitting the irrelevant city of Chonqing down to the yellow (WHY?). As we wait for Kimberley‘s turn to process (so we can see them take back 3+ cities), notice again how empty the Viet core is. The Trung Sisters had better get some more units or they will actually be in some serious trouble."
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene34.jpg'
  narration: "Aaaaaaand they all flip back. The four cities the Aussies took in the previous part all end up back in Jandamarra‘s hands. The dogfight for the outback is hotter than ever, with Junjuwa down to the red for Kimberley and Bidyadanga (very bottom of the slide) down to the red for Parkes. Any city capture that Parkes makes will immediately be contested by Jandamarra‘s ground and air troops, so from this point on I find it hard to imagine any real progress gets done from either side. The only real hope is in the Kimberley navy, which may be stomping through the Wobbegong."
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene35.jpg'
  narration: "Wait, there are parts of the world that aren‘t northern North America, the East Indies/Australia, and eastern Europe? I‘ll be damned…\n \nAnyways here‘s a shot of a pile of Siberian forts in the snow, since what else can you do with snow tiles? Kuchum Khan (Sibir) does have a frightening navy - if he could get it somewhere where it could be useful. Then again, a significantly less frightening navy in Finland is right next door…"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene36.jpg'
  narration: "F. David (Israel) is no more. While there is a chance that Jerusalem does flip back Israeli, if it does happen, then the next turn it will be permanently in Armenia‘s hands. In this Battle Royale, David could never really get off the ground. He settled a few cities and then lost Gaza early on and never recovered. The only reason he wasn‘t put out of his misery multiple times by the Spartans was because Jerusalem was not coastal. As is, the armies of mossad agents will live on, forever scouting the land for whoever cares to know what is out there."
- scene_number: 37

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene37.jpg'
  narration: "Back to North America, where the Inuit have a strangehold on Yankton, despite it being at 0 health. The nearby Infantry are nearly immune to cannon fire and block the way for the Texan GWI to get to the city."
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene38.jpg'
  narration: "Somewhere in the previous couple turns, Panduranga (the Champan capital) flipped back purple while Kauthara went to the Viets. The lone Indonesian musket looks on at the war-torn region, with the odd realization that his former homeland is actually the only part of this area that hasn‘t been obliterated by the Kimberley-Aussie-Viet-Champan war. The former cities of Gajah Madah (Indonesia) sit comfortably in Jandamarra‘s hands, perhaps the only part of the Kimberlean empire that is not currently besieged.\n \nAlso in this slide: Burma. Because that civ still exists in this game."
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene39.jpg'
  narration: "The Wobbegong assault on the isolated Kimberlean cities of the south is not exactly going well. Looma is the only one that is even threatened (though it looks like Wulungarra was poked a bit by that Caravel). I hate to say it to all you Aussie fans (and conspiracy theorists…) but this is not the stomp that people may have been expecting. The Wobbegong Armada is outdated in comparison to what Jandamarra has, and it is costing them, big-time."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene40.jpg'
  narration: "Henry Morgan finally relents and makes peace with Maria the Lazy, who gives up Goa and promptly goes to sleep in Cologne (which is still hers because her capital isn‘t on this slide). This war has worn her out, and the midnight train to nowhere (but goes there fast) is calling. So Henry, who‘s next?"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene41.jpg'
  narration: "The other Indonesian unit, a scout in eastern Europe, looks on as Leonidas takes Ohrid back. Indonesia must think that this world is going to hell (which it probably is), as everywhere they look, there is carnage. Cumae is also looking close to falling, though Sweden only has one melee unit in the area which is on extremely low HP.\nTPang‘s note: Perhaps the Indonesian Scout is on a pilgrimage to embody the long forgotten Polish Scout :‘("

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene42.jpg'
  narration: "Oh dear, the Inuit have captured Quebec city. It will get flipped back immediately, but that is 13 population that will be lost in the blink of an eye. Furthermore, it looks like Regina and Charlottetown are in fairly firm control of the Inuit. I don‘t know if we‘d seen it before now, but Lester does have machine guns now."
- scene_number: 43

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene43.jpg'
  narration: "Hey, David‘s back! Not for long, but he‘s not giving up without a fight. Too bad that all his remaining units are missionaries, which (last I checked) cannot capture cities.\n \nAlso relevant is the Hawaii-Mexican peace that has been made. It does not look like Hawaii ended up with any cities in the deal, but it is hard to tell off-camera."
- scene_number: 44

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene44.jpg'
  narration: "Another large pile of cities flip down under once again, this time including Junjuwa (Kimberley) and Vigan (Vietnam). I fully expect most of these to flip back after Jandamarra‘s turn processes, but do check out the Submarine hanging out near Kandiwal. That‘s bad news for an already outdated Aussie fleet."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene45.jpg'
  narration: "The Trung Sisters are in big trouble here. They are being pressured heavily by the Wobbegong, and have almost nothing that can recapture lost cities. I count exactly two units capable of doing so on this slide, none of which are anywhere near the places is that need it. Vigan is pretty much done for, and if Henry Parkes focuses his air force on Hoi An, we could see a huge population city flip over to Australia. If only Viet Congs could capture cities… (not like they actually have any in position anyway though)"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene46.jpg'
  narration: "For the first time on the mainland, Jandamarra flips a city that was originally Australian, seizing Sunshine Coast, much to the dismay of an Aussie Destroyer (!). I‘m not actually sure whether that means that Parkes has the tech for Destroyers or whether his gigantic pile of Privateers happened to capture a couple (there‘s another one nearby), but I supposed we shall see soon enough. Also flipping on this turn is Junjuwa and probably another several East Indie cities."

  narration: "And it is official, David has been eliminated in 45th place. Armenia, now with some breathing room, has got to tech up ASAP. Find a great scientist and bulb it or something, your neighbors have GWI. Oh, and get bigger cities please."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part39-scene48.jpg'
  narration: "The mapmakers have got to be busy right now, as multiple flips are happening per slide. The furiously scribble out the previous Inuit borders and replace them with Canadian borders, as Quebec city and Charlottetown have been claimed by Pearson. Worth noting that Canada only has 7 planes left - a paltry number compared to what they had at the beginning of this war, and two of them are sitting uselessly in Washington."

  narration: "AYY SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING USEFUL! The Polar Vortex descends upon Maria‘s capital, forcing her advisors to do the unthinkable - wake her up. She rises groggily and asks, 'Is it tomorrow yet?' Her advisors shake their heads and walk away, content to deal with the threat themselves. That being said, Cologne is going to be Icelandic in very short order, and their Moroccan allies have an easy grab at the one tile island that is left in the \nMediterranean. We could have a double elimination this part, folks!"

  narration: "As Ohrid and Cumae (!) flip in the background, we see that Sparta has decided to play nice and make peace with Maria. She loses one enemy but gains two in the meantime. Sparta secures Rome, but who knows how long that will last with the Swedish threat continuing to barrel down towards their capital."

  narration: "The mapmakers continue to scribble as the Inuit capture three more cities back, this time with Helicopters. The Texan force around Yankton is disintegrating, and while the Canadian force is still strong numerically, they are vastly outteched. I would not be surprised to see Rocket Artillery out of the Inuit here soon."

There are no units anywhere nearby that can capture a city (something something Viet Congs), and the Wobbegong is still barreling down on them. The Trung Sisters need to peace out of the war with Che right now to have any hope."

If the Boers even so much as sneezed on them, they‘d probably lose five cities at this point. We also see the empty backcountry of Carthage in this picture, oh so very DOWable."

I don‘t know what he‘s beelining to, but he‘s already got Paratroopers and Rocket Artillery, so could it be the dreaded XCOM carpet? His core actually isn‘t particularly impressive, with no cities that really stand out as being amazing, but you can‘t argue with the tech lead he has on everyone else."

  narration: "Yankton finally flips back, but that isn‘t likely to last for long, as the Inuit have melee units sitting right there waiting to take it back. The Texan units are very sparse at this point - they need to bring up reinforcements if they don‘t want to risk losing more cities."

Anyways the Inuit core is impressive, and will be even more so after the Inuit finish the Pentagon in their capital. That pile of ships to the north of Ivvavik is quite impressive.\nTPang‘s note: 3,2,3,4... 4,2,3 *rapid clapping*"

They don‘t have a whole lot of anything, and while they do have planes (thanks likely to a mountain next to the capital for that sweet, sweet observatory), that‘s about all they‘ve got. Fortunately for them, they‘re surrounded by doormats on three sides (Persia, Mughals, Sri Lanka), but even then they‘ve lost wars to Sri Lanka in the recent past."

At least Texas is keeping up the image of fighting here? Also say hello to the long-lost trireme and galleass of the Inuit. The civ has destroyers and battleships, and here are the first two versions of those ships you build hanging out down here. Aren‘t they cute?"

After looking at these navies more and more, I do think that Australia simply captured those destroyers and the submarine in an earlier slide rather than building them, but it is still hard to tell, since we haven‘t actually seen a shot of the Aussie core yet."

It is fairly well defended by planes, battleships, GWI and Artillery, but that‘s exactly what they‘re facing off against from Australia, so we‘ll have to see how things go. Those planes are going to have to be clutch here. The only reason Jandamarra is still contesting this pretty well is because Australia decided to fight a two-front war (needlessly)."

It must be those mind-controlled Steves, but we all know how unreliable they can be.\n \nWorth noting that the peace treaty between Mexico and Hawaii did not cause any cities to change hands. Waipahu was the lone casualty of that war (well millions upon millions of casualties but still), while Merida lost a ton of population."

  narration: "(grumble grumble Viet Cong grumble grumble)\n \nThis is EXACTLY the scenario I warned of in one of the threads last week about the Viet Cong. The Viets lost a coastal city to ships and only have units on the ground, none of which are capable of taking cities. They do have a nearby Ironclad which could help out, if it survives the next turn, which it may or may not end up doing. They do also have a Lancer up near Vigan, but unless Australia has already taken its turn, it is unlikely that will survive."

Said stronghold has seen its borders shrink drastically as of late, after the Mongol Khans decided that Mao‘s lands tasted good.

In the meantime, Ethiopia STILL hasn‘t DOW‘d the Ayyyyyyyyyyubids, instead deciding to give them the middle finger with citadels. I guess one sacrifices one unit for a few tiles, while the other sacrifices a bunch, so that kinda makes sense? #JustAIThings"

It even looks like the Lancer has a buddy, so perhaps there is hope. One thing is for sure - the number of submarines that Vietnam has will put any naval invasion to an immediate halt, which is exactly what it looks like has happened. Australia‘s navy is nowhere to be found, and perhaps Vietnam may have a chance to counterattack."

There are a lot of Kimberley planes in the region as well as ships and great war infantry, but they absolutely do not want to lose that city if at all possible. Considering that Kimberley goes immediately after Australia (and it is neither of their turns), it is hard to imagine them holding Kalumburu past next turn."
