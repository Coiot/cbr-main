  narration: "Hello r/civ, r/civbattleroyale, and assorted fast friends and eager followers! I’m Pastry_Lad, longtime follower of the civ battle royale(s), and I have the exceptional pleasure of penning this week’s narration for you. These last few parts have seen our humble cylinder thrown into chaos on a global scale, with battles raging on every continent and in every ocean. Will the senseless violence continue? This part’s ominous numbering seems to suggest so.  Also joining us today will be veteran commentator TA_Knight who has gladly stepped in to help add in much needed info, insight and oversight!"

  narration: "And heres the stat comparison between Australia and Vietnam, made by the hard-working /u/patkellyrh. Vietnam has grown much from their previous wars, but they are still weaker than Australia in stats. However, the front is to their advantage, and the only question is if they manage to keep it."

  narration: "Of Note: Blackfoot regains A‘aninin from Mexico at the end of this war.\nThe war may be over between Mexico and the Blackfoot, but that doesn’t mean the dying will stop. For hundreds of miles the land is irradiated, poisoning what little water remains from the drought and accentuating the thirst in millions of throats. Still, at least “being shot by paranoid paratroopers” is a hazard that can be checked off the displaced survivors’ lists. \nMaria and Chepe, sister and brother, survived much together. When news of the war ending reached their community, everyone felt like celebrating. Problem was, celebrations feel so empty with nothing to eat...and Chepe was looking worse and worse by the day. He was always the cheerful one, the resourceful one, and he had borne them through the darkest days of the war by scavenging from the ruins of nearby Ahahpitape. Until one time rubble proved untrustworthy, and Chepe sliced his leg open on rusted sheet metal. Ever since then it had fallen on Maria to provide, but she dare not stray close to the city. \nThe countryside became increasingly barren as every abandoned cupboard was picked dry. Chepe needed medicine. Maria found a cellar, with a father and a young boy inside, her age. The father had fever and the boy had medicine. Maria killed him when he tried to stop her. Chepe needed it.\nWhen she returned, Chepe was cold. His body lay there, exactly as she had left him two days earlier. Maria felt like crying, then laughing, but was too tired to do either. She went to sleep."

  narration: "Finland takes Alexandria, using the joint forces of an advanced destroyer ship, aided by the assistance of an XCOM squad securing the perimeters from hostile forces.\n \nMuch like in World War Z, Jerusalem’s occupants are separated from the outside horde by only a wall. The city is again trapped, though these zombies are highly trained in repulsing alien invaders and kicking green ass."

  narration: "For all the XCOMS we see abroad, the Boer core is still remarkably Paratrooper-based. Meanwhile, a Hawaiian Great Merchant makes its way through the exciting and exotic lands of Ethiopia.\nThe exiled Ashanti pikeman and Moroccan musketman are in view, both residing in their respective lakes. With little to do, they seem to have taken up a feud regarding whether it is more aesthetically pleasing to have a straight lake or a curving one. A Moroccan was overheard by their babysitter/guardian Moroccan helicopter yelling “Yuh, well say that my muzzle, ya tin can!”, prompting the further deployment of Boer peacekeepers to the area."

  narration: "Brazil finally does it! Buenos Aires falls! What was supposed a simple and easy task of rolling some infantry in became a nerve-wracking task of poking the walls until they collapse across multiple parts, but Brazil does it!

  narration: "Meridia falls again to Australia\nThe madman. The legend. Henry Morgan. Under the gentle waves of Guadalajara’s famous beach waits a Buccaneer nuclear submarine with a deadly payload. Never a fan of stalemates or wars of attrition, Morgan seeks to bust this war wide open. \nThe Mexicans can’t be blamed too much for letting the sub slip by, as the Texans are making a legendary racket over in Laredo. Reunited with the city lost in the first Mexican conflict, Laredo has been nothing but an orgy of patriotism, barbecue, and six-shooters since its liberation. I mean really, what part did Laredo fall? Maybe five? The joy in the air is palpable."

  narration: "The Vietnamese core expands to include some relatively recent captures, though they seem so long ago given all the recent Vietnamese conquests. These cities have been annexed, had their landscapes thoroughly improved, and have grown healthily in population. Also note the Future Worlds improvements west of Gyantse. Despite this, the carpet is still predominantly paratrooper-based."

  narration: "The Siberian core is a true sight, and one wonders how the Vietnamese hope to make any inroads here, especially when tied up in a conflict with Australia. Meanwhile, the Roman Ballista drifts aimlessly, its sinews long-ago rotted and arms fallen into disrepair. Imagine the look on the legionnaires’ faces were you to tell then that Iceland holds Rome now."

  narration: "The conscripts are dead, the city is surrounded and...the siege lifts. Ever one to toy with his prey, Kekkonen of the Finns is satisfied with the humiliation the Spartans have endured.

  narration: "The Swedes may need to modernize their ground forces, but they can certainly boast a modernized air force. A stack of drone fighters and at atomic bomb call Tonsberg home, and one can only assume more drones comprise the 9/10-deep stacks in Trondheim, Bergen, Oslo and Stavanger.

  narration: "On all fronts the Chilean army looks to be worn and tired, while the Brazilians seem to bring a never-ending wave of reinforcements. Perhaps Chile has stretched its defenders too thin, and will soon have to bear the loss of three cities in a single turn. Time is not on Chile’s side, but at this point, what is?"

  narration: "The Boers do have a small XCOM force in Messene, and plenty more are coming. While XCOM are slightly weaker than the Swedish Power Armor Infantry (or PAI), the Skynet wonder means that the Boer XCOM are stronger anyway. \nFinland, however, is still recovering from the war against Sparta, and most of the nearby forces are just paratroopers. They do have PAI and Mech Artillery of their own, but their low production capacity may pose a problem."

  narration: "Sweden doesnt have that much more, but on the air, Sweden is superior in the moment. On the ground its a different story however, as Sweden has very little land units compared to Finland.

  narration: "A view of North West Africa shows the massive contrast between the Boers and the Buccaneers, though this is partly because of the Vietnamese carpet residing in Buccaneer territory not too many parts ago. The Buccaneers have no excuse any more, though, without a carpet they have no way to declare war on a nearby civilization without losing multiple cities.\n \nThe Boers build one of the very last remaining wonders, the Ultima Tower. Its not really useful, giving some gold and a social policy, but its better than the Al Burj that the Inuit built.\n \nFor more information see http://i.imgur.com/sY07KHU.jpg"

Due to all the fallout all the cities in Mexico are losing population and im not sure if Mexico is able to build any meaningful amount of units any more. \nTexas, however, isnt fairing better, as Mexican bombers destroyed most of the Texan forces and are bombing Austin and Lahore. If Mexico gets even the smallest break from Australia and the Buccaneers, Texas will be swiped apart."

  narration: "Puerto Montt falls to the advancing Brazilian army as Chile is being pushed southward under Conception. Looks like the new front will be decided at Valdivia, but by then Chile will be too small to provide meaningful resistance."

  narration: "At first I hoped my Swedish brethren might be spared Boer wrath by the distance between them, but recent conquests have brought Boer land to the Swedish doorstep. Hordes of XCOMS pour over the border as Corinth, perhaps first of many, falls."

  narration: "Kuchum Khan of the Sibir shows solidarity with his fellow Khan by joining the war against Tibet. Meanwhile, Brazil has reinforced the captures of Santiago de Chile and Puerto Montt while advancing upon the Chilean city of Castro. Though the Chilean navy still has some teeth, the sooner this war ends the better for Chile. Sadly, that probably won’t mean regaining their lost capital."

  narration: "A new war! Mongolia, sick of losing, has navigated its way out of war with Finland and into a war with the city-state of Lhasa (Tibet). I guess “pick on somebody your own size” was a less on Genghis never took to heart. He is aided in this noble cause by Sri Lanka, who may find it difficult to send troops through the Vietnamese carpet.\nTA_Knote: A Sibirian scout was here once. He got evaporated to say the least."

  narration: "Sweden has taken the initiative in its war with Finland, striking deep (well, not really) at the Finns with a forceful occupation of the capital of Helsinki. Finnish Poland is feeling the heat as Wroclaw is taken to a sliver of health. The Lion of the North is back!\nPerhaps this explains why Finland let Mongolia off the hook so easily.\n73- TA_Knote: Moscow flips back and forth here."

  narration: "With this close-up of Lhasa we have the chance to admire the city‘s wonderful natural defenses. Even without the ruthless Vietnamese carpet, this would be a tough nut for Genghis to crack. \nA Vietnamese paratrooper, itching for some action, has had a bit of fun by sneaking a shot at the Royal Tibetan Riflemen. Only a single HP was lost, but ever stuffy, the riflemen open a formal investigation of the matter. Guarding the royal family’s mountainous refuge is no trifling matter."

  narration: "The Australians seem to have united the former Philippines, with the exception of the Blackfoot exclave of Olongapo. Despite this, their navy is nowhere to be seen. Heavy blows are being traded across the the ocean, borne upon the wings of aerial units. While the air force may take cities low, the battle will be won by he/they who bring a navy to capture them! Right now, that seems to be Vietnam. Expect flips in My Son and Whangarei soon."

  narration: "As uneasy standoff between Vietnamese Vigan and Australian Cebu continues. The remaining citizens of Cebu know they are Australian this week, a particularly uncomfortable situation to be in when surrounded by Vietnamese belligerents. This is especially true when one considers that the belligerents have an atomic bomb parked only two tiles away.\nTA_Knote: What was once a paratrooper carpet in Vietnam now gives away to a drone carpet. Much more powerful, but contributes even more to Vietnam‘s lack of land units."

  narration: "War is chaos, and this region certainly is chaotic. It’s worth taking a moment just to relish it; this is what you came for after all, you sick bastard. One the other hand, one thing is certain: with a fresh peace deal inked, Turfan will remain a Finnish exclave for now."

  narration: "Protective of their little enclave, Vietnam’s Trung Sisters declare war on the Sibir. Like World War I of our world, the casualties begin piling up along the front of the nation which came to the aid of its smaller ally. Sparkbed Tibet has yet to feel a loss. I wonder if they assassinated an archduke too?"

  narration: "The front is even larger than it seemed before, stretching all the way over to Caucasus. This is made possible by Vietnam’s most recent occupations. Hostilities seem relatively one-sided so far, with Siberian cities betraying the enormity of the Vietnamese aerial blitzkrieg. \nKabul teeters ever closer to the brink, and the door comes ever closer to slamming shut of the Afghanis."

  narration: "The Middle east erupts once again in chaos as no less than 7 forces are at play here. Sweden captures Constantinople, but the Boers are advancing fast and hard against them which may allow Finland to regain some cities. Sibir attacks Finland from the east, taking multiple cities themselves. This couldve been a golden opportunity for Vietnam to expand upon Sibirian captures into the Middle east, if it wasnt for Ethiopian peacekeepers preventing capture.\n \nAlso, Sparta is still at war with Sweden and Sibir, so if either one gets close, Sparta could still fall."

  narration: "The Boers make quick work of the Sweden‘s northernmost holdings, conquering in hours what it took the Swedish centuries to in millennia past. Swedish cities are taking hits from the Finnish air force, but Finnish Constantinople, Poznan, and Nicaea are all much worse for the wear. With all three of these cities being conquests, perhaps the Swedes will be able to work on their PR by depicting themselves as “proactive liberators.”"

  narration: "Australia is 158% the size of second place Inuit. Let’s just appreciate how large that gap is. If it really is something in the waters of the Pacific that drives nations to bloodthirsty victory, then Australia’s future is bright as it seems they control most of the ocean."

  narration: "The Boers of course maintain their numerical advantage in Military Manpower, but the distance between every other nation ranked 3rd or lower is really quite regular. Australia seems to be winning the long game in its war with Vietnam, who will have to make a move soon if it hopes to emerge the victor.\nTA_Knote: Vietnam recovers a bit in units, but more importantly, Finland and Sweden plummet, with Finland losing 570k military power and Sweden losing 400k. This is even more severe than it looks, thanks to the logarithmic algorithm of Military power."

  narration: "Australia has edged out the Inuit by a mere 2 cities, while the rest of the pack follows the leaders...starting at 33 cities behind. Korea, peeking into top science output in at 11th place, has just made it into the top cities list in 12th place."

  narration: "The Boer’s tech lead over runner-up Inuit dwindles in terms of both size and relevance, as the end of the tech tree approaches more nations. Korea has made an impressive push in the sciences, and is now trailing the Inuit by only three technologies! Between their recent conquests, decent AI tacticians that successfully navigated a multifront war, and now this development we may see a global power in the making. Perhaps it is something in the water, as many of the most successful nations seem to be near the Pacific. Except those poor Hawaiians, of course.\nTA_Knote: the most surprising here is that Australia made another leap frog in tech, getting 5 technologies in the span of a single part."

  narration: "Catholicism has become dominant in terms of number of followers, but is followed by Eastern Orthodoxy rather than longtime-rival Judaism. This development is likely driven by the Boers’ obscene population growth of recent. As is tradition, 9 of the Party Pope’s most devout disciples make their mark by throwing “sick ragers”, according to a witness."

  narration: "We end this part with a religion map, presenting a worldview that appears far more unified than the reality. Mexican Catholicism has spread to every corner of the Americas and Greenland, while Japanese Shinto has swayed much of the Inuit’s core in Alaska. Ethiopian Eastern Orthodoxy and Israeli Judaism have provided rare common ground for the peoples of their continents, while in the east brother slays brother as Buddhist Australia and Buddhist Vietnam continue to murder each other by the millions."
