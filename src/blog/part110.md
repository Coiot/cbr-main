  narration: "Worldwide Boer Ryk\nTwelve Million Paratroopers\nWorldwide Brazil Ryk\nWelcome to the Civ Battle Royale part 110. I, Poblano, will be your narrator for this week, and if you can’t tell, there will be lots of haikus this part. Our OC for this week is a map of the Boers at their greatest extent. We can see now just how much they’ve lost. Poor, poor Boers."

  narration: "Inuit death comes\nNuclear hell consumes all\nWar never changes. \nLast week saw the Inuit make a fatal error: They declared on the Buccs, who had a defensive pact with Brazil(I guess the Buccs forgot that Brazil slaughtered them long ago). This will not end well for them. Nukes slaughtered their units that were stationed at the borders. This is the third Inuit-Brazil war since the reboot. Third time’s the charm, as they say."

  narration: "Once Mexican land\nNo longer Mexicans here\nOnly Carnival\nCoiot’s Note: Lunar will be joining Poblano narrating the odd numbered slides below the haikus.\nXcoms are truly winning the war for Brazil here. Brazil also don‘t have open borders with Blackfoot but do with Kimberley. I see they recognize the true foes here."

  narration: "Puebla, Mexico\nFound “where serpents change their skin”\nAnd where XCOMs land\nBrazil seems to be focusing on taking every single former Mexican city, Puebla being the latest victim. Jeez, a nuclear war being fought over Mexico? Haven’t we seen this before? Quit with the re-runs Blue Cassette."

  narration: "Here lies Albany\nTombstone of Lincoln himself\nReads “Let Freedom Ring”\nSurprisingly it seems that Inuit have a strong defense here. Brazil is becoming weak and Inuit have ton of planes in the area. It seems that pushing beyond here will be tough. Of note: Cincinnati is now completely blocked off by Buccaneer Bordergore™"

  narration: "No turtle ships now\nNor hwach’a for Sejong\nNo units at all\nKorea is running out of units quickly. Vietnam seems to be focusing on Korean coastal cities first, a wise strategy. Korea has no way to reinforce these cities. More importantly, Brazil and Vietnam do not have open borders. Brazil’s city in this region is just more ammo for the “Delete Brazil” camp."

  narration: "Pax Siberia\nWhen Jokuskai slept in peace\nThe sleep is gone now\nYakutian capital seems to the only thing flipping. I could see Tommot flipping once as well, but it seems to be flipping for once as they move east. I do however find it difficult for Korea to make long term gains here though."

  narration: "The Boer capital\nBut only penguins live here\nThe Boers are dead\nThe Boers have been restricted to the antarctic. These cities do not hold any humans anymore. They have populated by robotic human-penguin hybrids for years. Now the robo-penguins are all that remains of the Boers. Australia declares war to try to get rid of the penguins."

  narration: "Huehuehuehuehue\nHuehuehuehuehuehuehue\nHuehuehuehuehue\nIt seems the remains of former Texas proper are good health packs for this army as it moves onward. A good amount of Brazil disappeared as a good amount of Inuit form. If Ekeuhnick can hold, they might hold onto the husk of America. Also, Brazil has Giant Death Robots. Yeah. Moving on."

  narration: "Cincinnati falls\nA world renowned city falls\nLol jk who cares\nInuit have some troops on the coast to defend this region, but the real worry is their interior core is defenseless. They may protect the coast, BUT AT WHAT COST? AT WHAT COST?"

  narration: "Not-Brazil loses\nA city to not-Brazil;\nAnd more will follow\nBrazil is still being detrimental to the Vietnamese war efforts and Australia is ensuring the war will be one sided. Australia does as Australia does I suppose."

  narration: "Peaceful ocean gulf\nNo nuclear fallout here\nAncient citadels\nThe gulf coast is almost unified. All that remains of the ancient maya, Mexicans, and texans is the city names and citadels. It’s a shame."

  narration: "Blackfoot Torreon\nThen Inuit Torreon\nBrazil Torreon\nIt’s more likely that this front will flip over and over much like the Blackfoot Mexico war of old. War will be determined on the whims of central US. So it’s like the US election. Except with nukes, death and Brazilians."

  narration: "No more OCP\nNo more Boer containment\nNo more Boer ryk\n“Dear goodness. Oh geez. Oh dang. Oh darn. Oh wow. Guys, I think this game is over”…. Is what I would say if these weren’t primarily hovertank. You keep on being you Pedro."

  narration: "Do you remember?\nMexico once laid claims here\nMexico is dead\nThe Brazilian push finally reaches cities that were originally Blackfoot, a testament to the amount of land the Blackfoot conquered from Mexico before the Inuit brutally slaughtered them."
- scene_number: 17

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "Nothing to lose, here\nNothing to win, here, either\nMorgan is alone\nThe Buccaneers are officially surrounded on 3 sides by Brazil. There is no territory for them to conquer. The Buccaneers helped Brazil win this war by ruthlessly slinging nukes because they have nothing else to lose."

  narration: "Inuit collapse\n“Omae wa mou shindeiru”\n“NANI?” - Inuit\nFort Rouille is a massive multiplayer shooter where sixty war trained warriors drop into a map and fight it to the death. Except they are all Brazilian. And just like the game that shall not be named, there is one flagy boi doing absolutely nothing waiting to die. Of actual note Iceland can probably make some gains here… is what I would say if Iceland had a single melee unit period."

  narration: "Fifty words for snow\nyet no words for “a defeat”\nNo need, until now\nOut of nowhere, a great mass of Brazilian units appears to greet the Inuit defenders. I wonder if this how people felt when the mongols invaded in. A great number of cities fall. The Inuit have never tasted defeat before."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene20.jpg'
  narration: "New York has fallen\nWas the carnival worth it?\nBillions have now died\nI used to think it was unlikely that the front wouldn’t be supplied by Brazil, but I think I know why more units keep on appearing here. Brazil have been using airports to teleport units to the frontline using Inuits well developed territory, turning the roads that Inuit made in their sleep to their advantage to bring units from the core. If Inuit was joined with a power like Sibir, this war might be less decisive, but all units generated by Brazil appear in the front, airdrop to the front and paradrop to the warfront. Unless Sibir attacks now, this is over folks."

  narration: "War torn Rach Dia\nLow health for eternity\nNo peace in our time\nIf you looked at the screenshot of last turn, you probably could see this coming. Rach dia will be at zero health for a long time, but there’s little to no chance Korea takes it back."
- scene_number: 22

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene22.jpg'
  narration: "Nothing happens here\nAnd yet everything happens\nI’m very confused\nAs predicted, Tommot and Jokuskai remain in Sibir’s hand. Inuit clogging up this war while losing another. All in all things are proceeding all on schedule."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene23.jpg'
  narration: "End Korean war\nAnd Vietnam has no seoul\nRach Dia is free\nWell, way to make me look dumb, Vietnam. Rach dia doesn’t have to worry about war for a while now. Vietnam gets most of the Korean peninsula… except for the south part. Motion to call Korea “South Korea” for the rest of the game."

  narration: "one-sided peace deals\nVietnam’s main specialty\nAt least ten cities\nAustralia not having open borders with Vietnam is huge here, effectively entirely crippling and immortalizing Seoul up north and forcing his mediocre navy down south. Vietnam, how did you do it? How did you take an entire Buccaneer amount of land in a one-sided trade deal? Teach me your methods."

  narration: "Vietnam-Sibir\nTen screenshots of a bad war\nNothing happens here\nNothing here has changed since the last screenshot. For some reason, this makes me feel tired. Maybe it’s the former Yakutian lands?"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene26.jpg'
  narration: "Brazil loses troops\nNow this could have meant something\nBut Inuit dumb\nThis seems to be the holding point for now. Brazil is overstretched on this front and they do not have significant enough air superiority for this to mean more than a few city flips. Inuit also are bringing out their most feared unit. Artillery."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "God died long ago\nWe killed him with carnival\nHuehuehuehuehue\nThe Inuit quickly try to get their troops to the interior, but in doing so leave their coastal cities unprotected. Look for Montreal and Vancouver to fall soon. Vancouver being on the east coast is triggering me right now."

  narration: "Quiet Joinville\nNow, Population: Zero\nBrazil killed them all\nThese mountains are likely to be a meat grinder as man versus machine here and the only victor is the bloodthirstiness stat at the end of the part. Let us all celebrate the senseless death. In more positive news. Brazil has almost fully formed the former empire of their once ally Blackfoot."

  narration: "Winnipeg is bad\nTheir hockey team isn’t good\nZero Playoff Wins\nExcuse me for the hockey jokes, but Winnipeg is the latest city to fall to the Brazilian horde. Look for more cities to fall as Brazilian troops teleport and paradrop behind the Inuit troops. Nothing personnel, Ekeuhnick.\n(Lunar Note: No U)"

  narration: "Nothing happens here\nIt’s the curse of Yakutia\nJokuskai is cursed.\nSibir front has slowly moved inwards. It seems unlikely that this war will go on longer. But the question is how much border gore will the peace deal accomplish. Finnish supporters wait with bated breaths."

  narration: "EGADES! My roast is\nRuined! But what if I were\nTo purchase fast food\nI’m not sure what i’m looking at here. Aurora Boer-ealis? Steamed SAMs? Either way, Carthaginian cities have advanced in technology. Hannibal would be disgusted."

  narration: "Inuit fight back\nBut it will be Brazilian\nCarnival won’t stop\nBlackfoot abandon Inuit even more so, allowing the famously flipped city of A’Aninin to relive old times once more. I think this is worthy of a celebration. If only there was a globally recognized festival they could participate in?"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene33.jpg'
  narration: "Charlotte’s town falls\nD E L E T E B\nR A Z I L\nEither Inuit troops are retreating and letting Brazil push north unimpeded, or Brazil is simply slaughtering them. I’m inclined to believe the first one, in which case: Ekeuhnick, this isn’t Russia. You can’t raze your own cities and hope the harsh winter will kill Brazilian troops. It doesn’t work that way."

  narration: "Sibir is next\nHide yo children, hide yo wife\nCarnival’s coming\nFor real tho’ this war would be absolutely beautifully chaotic. A war from the inside out with an equally superior groundforce. If they only had an airforce to back that us, it could be something to fear. Sibir has to war and now. Do it."

  narration: "Poland is dead\nThey’ve been dead for awhile\nThey’re dead in sea-bricks\nPoor Poland. They didn’t have a chance in the BR and they didn’t make it into CBRX. I’m sure the 2 or 3 Poland supporters left have been happy to see their former enemies slaughtered by Brazil though."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene36.jpg'
  narration: "Unpronounceable\nCan’t fit it in a haiku\nZero out of ten.\nBrazil keeps on hitting about their belts. I would say that this is exceptional, but this is just normal business for Brazil. When they were fighting in wars, Brazil were building units. When they were nuking their neighbours into irrelevance, Brazil built units. When they wasted their days being diplomatic with Blackfoot, they cultivated even more units. And now that the world is on fire and Brazilians are at Inuit gate, you have the audacity to come to Pedro for forgiveness?"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part110-scene37.jpg'
  narration: "Want to see the world?\nThen book a carnival cruise\nHuehuehuehuehue\nI could see an Inuit pushback in this region, but it would ultimately be a big mistake for the Inuit as Brazil continues to jump behind Inuit lines. Vancouver is at low enough health that if Brazil can get a melee unit nearby it’s gone. Those submarines in the coast aren’t helping the Inuit, either."

  narration: "Druzhina now flips\nBut It might flip back next turn\nLife is meaningless\nThe war is chaotic all around. Remember the Korean denouncement of Australia; yeah that might be the worst decision in the history of everything CBR. There is more Australia fighting units here than there are people who hate Australia. That’s a lot of units."

  narration: "You forgot this war\nThat’s okay, I did it too\nBoers forgot too\nRemember the first Boer-Sweden war? That was when we really though the Boers were really unstoppable. They won the first OCP, slaughtered Ethiopia, and captured a lot of Sweden cities. Sweden only forced a stalemate through nuking their own former cities."

  narration: "Vancouver, Brazil\nQuaint Atlantic coastal town\nNone of this is real\nThis seems likely to flip, but units here are getting a bit worse off for wear. Paratroopers replace XCOM and no Giant Death Robots are to be found. Does this mean that Brazil are done aggressing. Haha. Haha. Ha. No."

  narration: "Druzinha flipped back\nBut it might flip back next turn\nLife is meaningless\nKorea continues to defend this region despite being nearly out of units. They flipped Druzhina to keep for part of another turn, but was it worth it? When the city flips back they’ll lose yet another unit and the defense will get even more dire."

  narration: "No revive today\nSitting Jesus please come back\nCylinder needs you\nThe Sioux Inuit are collapsing rapidly. They lose a lot of former Sioux cities. Perhaps if they flip them back we’ll see a panic revival? Hopefully the Inuit have been studying ancient Kilwa defense strategies."

Your welcome voice narrator sir. It seems likely that Mongolia might make some gains here. Yeah, I said that. What is the Battle Royale?"

  narration: "Tabriz builds units\nIt will take six turns to build\nAnd six turns to die\nTabriz is a rare city in this BR: it hasn’t had time to redevelop, so it actually takes more than 2 or 3 turns to build a unit. Too bad this biotrooper is probably doomed to die in a Korean meat grinder."

  narration: "Erik Karlsson\nHe can’t save you anymore\nOttawa is done\nSee, this joke is funny because Erik Karlsson is a hockey player for the Ottawa Senators and he dragged them to the playoffs last year but this year the Senators are really bad and he got hurt and so he can’t drag them to the playoffs and also he almost got traded this year and I’m sorry for this comparison I’m so sorry. All this to say Ottawa fell to Brazil."

  narration: "Must be lonely here\nIn this desolate icetown\nSix million penguins\nSince there’s nothing species to note here: I thought I might as well take note that Cargo Ships have an icon that looks like a sail. I know the unit graphic changes, but I like to imagine them refusing to stop using ships with sails in the Futuristic time of 5351AD. Dear God."

  narration: "“It’s over, Kruger!”\n, says Emperor Pedro II\n“I have the high ground!”\nThis might be worrying for the Penguins if Brazil actually had a navy or any place to land their troops. At least Boer’s lose their carriers to strikes, which can no doubt help the zombified Boer nation’s limited resources."

  narration: "Unpronounceable\nWhy can’t the Blackfoot settle\nCities with real names\nT-This has to be the end right? This has to be the end to oppression. This has to be end of Brazilian dominance. I’ll pull a quote from Hamilton to aid us in the upcoming battles.\n“Scratch that; this is not a moment, it’s the movement. Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went? Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand. We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land.  If they win their independence. Does that guarantee freedom for their descendants. Or will the blood be shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants.”\nDawkinzz Note: Hey come on now, don’t go disrespecting my Blackfoot! Sure I can be a bit harsh on Sweden, Norway, and Finland, but whatever!"
