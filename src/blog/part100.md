  narration: |-
    Hello! I’m /u/ReonMonterus, with me are /u/Limerickarcher and /u/LunarNeedle, and we are here to bring you Part 100 of the CBR! We’re so excited that you have stuck with us this far and hope that you continue to enjoy the CBR. There is still plenty of exciting events to come, many of which are in this expanded part, which has come in at a grand total of 125 slides and a full 30 turns!
    In this, the centennial part of the CBR MkII, we should take a moment to look back at days long gone. This civball map of the world from part 6 shows how many fallen civs we have lost, and how far some of our current contenders have come. With nations like Korea and Sweden coming up from behind to live as long and be as powerful as they are shows that in a game like this, anything can happen!

  narration: "Hello, this is /u/Limerickarcher or Lime as I’m more commonly known.
    I’ll be narrating this first batch of slides, before passing the baton to another
    comrade. Let’s get started with the Power Rankings! \nThe Boers stay at the top
    for another week, will they ever be deposed from their throne?"

    the finer details and familiarize yourself before we get started!

  narration: "Alright enough introduction, let’s get this party started! What better
    way than with the capture of Yerevan, the Armenian capital. Content with their
    capital in hand, Sibir leaves Armenia to rot in the poor 4 tile city of Gaza which
    doesn’t even appear to have a Courthouse, so much for justice. I suspect this
    is the last we’ll see of Tiridates until a nearby civ decides to absorb the warmonger
    penalty. Perhaps the Boers could add it to their new collection of cities in the
    Middle East, I count 3 new ones in this shot already. \nAlso, as a disclaimer.
    When I make predictions they are purely how I would view this part as a first
    time reader, there are no hidden spoilers so I wouldn’t bother over analyzing
    my outlandish claims.\nCoiot‘s Note: Armenia #1"

  narration: "Not much has changed here in the Sweden-Iceland war, both sides seem
    to have a large crop of new recruits so I suspect the flippy-floppy will go on
    for a while. \nIn other news, why in the world do the Boers have so many units
    in the Black Sea? Further, at least 8 of those air units are missiles!? Are they
    nuking Vietnam from all the way up there?"
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene07.jpg
  narration: Rejykavík flips twice and Sweden keeps Cologne. I would wager Cologne
    is permanently theirs now based on the wide expanse of neon green in the way (although
    there is a singular line of workers that could act as an avenue).
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene08.jpg
  narration: "Brazilian units seem to be preventing any land attack on Keflavik, and
    the Iceland navy appears large and intimidating enough to scare off any Inuit
    attacks. Speaking of that navy, St. Louis appears like it might flip, I see some
    nearby melee units. \n7: number of Inuit settlers on this slide. 1: number of
    potential settling spots (southern tip of Nova Scotia, currently occupied by a
    Brazilian paratrooper)."
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene09.jpg
  narration: Mongolian, Korean, Kimberley, Blackfoot and Brazilian units all watch
    as Australia and Vietnam continue to beat their heads against each other in futility.
    Rugby anyone?
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene10.jpg
  narration: We return to South India where Vietnam reclaims Trincomalee from the
    Boers, although it may be short-lived considering there are a couple Boer units
    sitting on the doorstep. There may also be the potential for a Sri Lankan snipe,
    a couple eagle-eyed observers noticed Sri Lanka denounced Vietnam last part.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene11.jpg
  narration: The Boers continue to repopulate the Middle East, as a couple more cities
    are shown off here. Kruger appears to be getting friendly with every civ on the
    cylinder, as I spot open borders or trading with Sri Lanka, Hawaii, Finland, Sweden,
    Iceland and the Boers. Don’t worry, a couple tweaks are made in the future to
    correct this friendly behavior. Also of interest is the conga line of 10 boats
    floating in a row on the Red Sea, all oriented in exactly the same direction.
    Coincidence? I think not.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene12.jpg
  narration: Sweden retakes Constantinople in their last gasp attempt to secure as
    many cities as possible before the encroaching wave of Brazilian troops overtakes
    their troops.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene13.jpg
  narration: 'Well so much for my claims about Cologne being unequivocally Swedish.
    It’s also curious to note how many Swedish cities have been nuked to oblivion:
    Hamburg, Oslo and Berlin are all obvious examples but I’m sure others have also
    tasted the nuclear rain.'
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene14.jpg
  narration: 'A look at the Swedish core reveals some of Gustavus’ idiocy: 10 settlers
    and not hardly any land military to fight their ongoing wars. At least they settled
    a new city? (Jönköping)'
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene15.jpg
  narration: Part 100 is surely the cause for the sub’s golden age, but eh who cares
    let’s get to the new WAR!!!
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene16.jpg
  narration: "Or not. Yet. Which idiot culled these slides? Oh wait, it was me. :D
    \nBut actually, I think this slide is quite interesting because it shows that
    not only are the Inuit willing to send their massive navy far and away (whereas
    the Boers are more homebodies), but also the Inuit have much better naval biases,
    their fleet consists predominantly of Arsenal Ships, which are significantly stronger
    than the Boer alternative of Cybersubs. \nCoiot‘s Note: Glaciers sometimes do
    go adrift."
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene17.jpg
  narration: Onto the war! At first glance Sibir appears to outnumber Sweden but then
    you realize it’s mostly workers and the weaker Robot Infantry. As if to accentuate
    that detail, Sweden quickly spins around and captures Gothenburg while they deal
    massive damage to Moscow, Antioch, Jyvaskyla and Vaasa.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene18.jpg
  narration: The trend continues up north where Tampere, Linköping and Long Xuyen
    all fall into the red from an aerial barrage while every single Swedish city in
    this slide remains untouched. What are you doing Kuchum?
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene19.jpg
  narration: Gustavus’ fleet starts pouring out of the northern seas, descending on
    Jyväskylä and Akrofuom without any Siberian resistance. This is the perfect
    chance for an AI naval showcase! C’mon Gustavus, you’ve already proved you can
    perfectly pull off the land blitzkrieg!
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene20.jpg
  narration: Bye bye Messene. Never fear, Ingólfur has already prepared by wisely
    building a settler in Sparta. Genius move, better hope it doesn’t get nuked to
    oblivion again.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene21.jpg
  narration: Flip. Flop. The best city (find it in eastern Britain) takes some scattered
    damage from stray Swedish aircraft.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene22.jpg
  narration: 'A Brazilian cybersub bravely enters the DMZ, hoping to slip unnoticed
    below the constant firing above them as the Lion of the North and his brother,
    the Aristocratic Wolf, blast missiles at each other at a high velocity. Note:
    Ingólfur translates to Aristocratic Wolf, if you were wondering.'
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene23.jpg
  narration: Australia regains a foothold on the mainland again with the capturing
    of Panduranga. As we’ve seen in other parts of the world, peacekeepers are causing
    Vietnamese generals extreme consternation as they carpet South East Asia.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene24.jpg
  narration: Come in? We’ve briefly gotten ahold of a communications arrkrsssttzzz
    Get us out of this frozen hellhofiiisssszzzzz... POP (a small explosion can be
    heard) Mao shall live foreverrrrrr.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene25.jpg
  narration: Vietnam takes Panduranga back, but Australia’s still the pestilence that
    won’t go away, capturing Thi Li Bi Nai. Kimberley peacekeepers stand by and watch
    the war go on.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene26.jpg
  narration: The Boers’ expansive front of biotroopers stares at the Himalayas; most
    of them appear fortified as they contemplate how to scale the mountains. While
    they’re thinking, a Robot Infantry captures Balkh for the Kruger War Machine and
    Vietnam retakes Peshawar. It appears Peshawar flipped offscreen a couple times,
    as they’re down quite a bit of population since we saw them last.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene27.jpg
  narration: Gustavus captures Vaasa but judging by the Mechanized Artillery and Biotroopers
    I wouldn’t hold out a whole lot of hope.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene28.jpg
  narration: Awwww how cute! It’s Gaza! They have 5 tiles now! 12 Citizens! And not
    only are they so developed, they’re obviously quite willing to spread their culture
    of cuteness with the rest of the world judging by the 4 specialists in the Guilds!
    Awww, Armenia. :)
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene29.jpg
  narration: 'Yeah you read the notification right: apparently the Boers aren’t so
    chummy with everyone on the cylinder. In all seriousness, a Boer-Sibir war would
    cause tons of damage, the two share a wide border and could potentially lead to
    a Boer escapade into Asia proper? Intriguing...'
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene30.jpg
  narration: "A Siberian convoy stumbles into the Middle East, quietly sneaking behind
    the Swedish guard to hop the river into Hebron. Befuddled, Swedish units stand
    and stare and produce more settlers. The same tactics also appear to work in Tigranocerta,
    as the city falls to Sibir. \nAlso in the northern corner, Iceland retakes Constantinople
    from Sweden. Hah, I bet you forgot that war is still being fought."
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene31.jpg
  narration: "Gothenburg turns grey again while Vaasa flips twice and joins the 1
    pop city club. Sweden has a whole bunch of units down south, I think Sibir might’ve
    bitten off more than they can chew. Sure they’re winning in city counts, but I’m
    not sure how long that’s going to last. \nIn the bottom left corner of this slide,
    the new city of Sundsvall makes an appearance. It was actually founded a couple
    turns ago, but we get our first real shot of its terrible positioning between
    two mountains."
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene32.jpg
  narration: In the north, Gustavus makes a strong push through a bunch of weak cities,
    claiming Stalingrad and Kuopio, seemingly permanently based on the paucity of
    nearby military units.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene33.jpg
  narration: |-
    Goodbye Tegea. You will be immediately forgotten and replaced by another Swedish settler. The only debate now is which settler will make it to the prime spot first.
    Coiot‘s Note: Sparta‘s lasting legacy will soon only be Dvin at this rate.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene34.jpg

- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene35.jpg
  narration: Perhaps in retribution for the brutal citadelling of Kazan and Almarikh
    Genghis Khan denounces Kuchum Khan. I’m pretty sure all of Sibir’s neighbors have
    either denounced them or are at war, yet somehow the old grey menace holds on.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene36.jpg
  narration: 'The Boers found Kupartiya only for it to be immediately flattened by
    the Vietnamese Air Force. Boer Biotroopers are still wondering how to climb mountains.
    Here’s a hint: start. Or go around.'
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene37.jpg
  narration: 4 cities flip in this war. All of them are now at 1 population. Will
    someone just throw a nuke and get them out of here! They’re ruined shells! Surely
    no one lives there anymore?
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene38.jpg
  narration: "Thank goodness, finally the cylinder understands the plight of seals.
    They’ve been carted around like some luxury, forced to perform beachball tricks
    and act as the dumb animal in many an American movie. It’s good to see the world
    begin to care about the nature they live in and thrive off of. \nWait? What was
    that? Record high levels of radiation around the nation? Impending doom? \nBut.
    Seals?"
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene39.jpg
  narration: In other news, the Boers and Vietnam come to terms, as Vietnam decides
    to forfeit a pile of cities for peace, including the useless one tile island named
    Ambon. Funny enough it happens to control a singular tile on the coast of South-East
    Asia, causing many a mapmaker to tear their hair out at the continued border gore.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene40.jpg
  narration: We pan north where Vietnam has finally struck back against the Australian
    menace, retaking Hai Phong and Bien Hoa. Perhaps they’ll have the chance to completely
    expel Parkes now that the Trung Sisters are finished being stomped all over by
    Kruger.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene41.jpg
  narration: Speaking of getting stomped on, Kruger somehow receives the massive city
    of Lahor while Vietnam keeps the useless Peshawar. But wait, there’s more.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene42.jpg
  narration: |-
    Yup, the Boers also received Lahore...
    Coiot‘s Note: Lovely way to bookend your conquests.
- scene_number: "43"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene43.jpg
  narration: Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, Vavunya, Kalumnai, Galle, Colombo, Pathen and
    Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte in the peace deal. That’s 10 cities, in which a grand
    total of 105,023,000 citizens are living. For reference, in that peace deal Kruger
    received an entire Sweden, 2 Finlands and 2 Armenias in the form of citizens.
- scene_number: "44"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene44.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian carpet continues to expand at an alarming rate, overtaking
    France and most of Germany now. Speaking of Germany, Iceland sneaks around and
    takes the city of Hamburg.
- scene_number: "45"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene45.jpg
  narration: The Iceland-Inuit showdown ends with about as much flair as it was fought,
    not a whole lot. The Inuit come away with 4 more cities to add to their snowy
    collection, but there wasn’t any massive collapse of Iceland as was predicted.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene46.jpg
  narration: 'Ah, the terms of peace become more clear: Iceland is sending ridiculous
    amounts of gold to Inuit for the Inuit to do approximately nothing with.'
- scene_number: "47"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene47.jpg
  narration: "As a final parting shot we get a view of the other Inuit-Iceland front
    that’s been closed off for now. With that, my time with you has come to a close,
    it’s been a pleasure to narrate, please keep on reading though, it only gets better!
    \nMake sure to watch out for the ridiculously large DC coming out on Friday, and
    visit the Info Sheet! It’s almost completely up to date, and if you’re interested
    in making sure it stays there please PM me, I’m open to more help!  \nAu revoir!"

  narration: |-
    Hello! I’m /u/ReonMonterus and I will be your guide for these next few slides of the part.
    As the war between the Inuit and Iceland closes, the other front with the perennial underdog Sweden slowly becomes more and more clogged up with Brazilian vacationers. It seems like it will be difficult for either party to make any more headway here.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene49.jpg
  narration: From one peacekeeper clogged front to another, we shift to Aus v Nam
    where it looks like Blackfoot and Kimberley peacekeepers are making it difficult
    for Australia to advance.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene50.jpg
  narration: |-
    We shift back to Europe for the next turn where we can see the brutal methods of the Swedish Air Force at work. Interestingly, they choose to reduce cities to zero HP before moving to the next.
    A lone Australian Robot Infantry stands near Malmo (and real world Denmark) watching the effects on the Brazilian vacationers on the front and transmitting it directly back to Henry Parkes supercomputer center for analysis.
- scene_number: "51"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene51.jpg
  narration: "Looking at a clearer front now, between Sweden and Sibir, we can see
    Sweden has finally achieved tech parity with it’s snowbound counterpart, at least
    when it comes to biotroopers. \nIt seems Sweden is favoring an attack on Stalingrad
    while Sibir is looking to take Akrofuom."
- scene_number: "52"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene52.jpg
  narration: The party on the sub slows down for a bit as our most recent golden age
    ends. Babylonians are passed out in the hallways, sleeping by the light of monitors
    displaying the constant destruction going on around them. They will not sleep
    long however as there is still much more to come.

  narration: |-
    Vietnam pushes forward in the north, isolating Rach Gia and potentially cutting it off from Aussie reinforcements. The vast Korean navy looks on from near Seoul. Whether they are sleeping or plotting, no one is really sure.
    Coiot‘s Note: No one indeed.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene54.jpg
  narration: Northern Anatolia sits in Sibir hands while Iceland holds Constantinople,
    the ever flipped former capital of the Byzantines. A Sibirian expeditionary force
    pushes in towards Gothenburg and Antioch, and you can see the Brazilian vacationers
    start to spill in from the left.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene55.jpg
  narration: Moving north, the Swedes are making a move on Moscow, hoping to take
    back the former USSR capital and destroy whatever air unit is currently stored
    there. A significant Sibir worker army stands at the ready to repair improvements
    as the front moves forward, restoring services and amenities to the few remaining
    citizens in the area.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene56.jpg
  narration: One of our spies gives us a look into the Mongolian city of Dalandzadgad
    where Mongolia seems to be building an implant clinic. It is of debatable usefulness
    considering it adds 1 Gold and 1 Hammer for each 4 Citizens, meaning it will add
    2 Gold and 2 Hammers to this, a 9 citizen city. It is still growing however, which
    is good for Mongolia as it, in its entirety, contains a similar number of citizens
    as the Hawaiian city state.

  narration: |-
    Panning back south, we can see the no man‘s land between Vietnam and Australia in southeast Asia. Some units are attempting to make the crossing but it is unlikely that any shall live.
    You can, of course, see the notification on screen…
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene58.jpg
  narration: That’s right, someone finally decided to put the hurt on the Kimberley.
    Here we can see the forward operating bases that will be used to station air units
    to fight the war. Recently gained from Vietnam in a peace deal, these cities are
    still not even out of resistance yet.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: Image 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part100-scene59.jpg
  narration: While the large number of Kimberley troops stocked up in Vietnam will
    most likely prove useful in fighting Kruger, the Kimberley navy is also quite
    large and spread out, although seemingly lacking in any melee units.

    On to the next turn as we can see that Sweden’s push for Stalingrad was successful, although the city is surrounded by Sibir units looking to take it back. In a surprise move it looks like Sweden was able to pick up Moscow as well, at least for the moment. Sibir units have advanced into the Swedish interior, almost reaching Minsk.
    A Boer carrier sits in a lake near Tampere, it’s captain wondering how he got stuck with this assignment. How could he have angered Kruger so bad that he would strand a carrier on a lake far from home just to punish him?

    cities and free them from Skynet’s control. The Trung Sisters look on from afar,

    At 49 pop, a city flip of Wulungarra would be one of the most devastating single
    population losses of the cylinder to date. On the flip side, the Kimberley have
    bombed Middleburg down to almost zero health. If they can move a melee unit up,
    they could reasonably flip the city and put some hurt on Kruger, at least in this
    small part of his vast empire.

    red lines between most of the active wars, as expected, but more interestingly
    is the red/orange combo between the Blackfoot and Hawaii. Could this lead to us

    In the European theater, we can very easily see flips; and with nuclear devastation

    While it seems like Sweden is choked here, don’t fret. For the same problem that allowed Australia and Brazil to cloak the world is in effect here, and considering their neighbours aren’t likely to have Open Borders, it will likely flood to the Eastern front. However, it seems pretty unlikely as the requirement for that to happen is a garrison in each city and almost every city here is lacking a garrison. Come on Gustavus, I switched my flair for you. Either clear open borders and abuse the relocation bug Firaxis oh so generously provided you.

    Everyone’s favorite vacation home gets visited by the Boers who still seem determined to take every single city they can reach. It doesn’t seem likely this city will flip more than once but due to the wonders in the Boer’s possession and the palty forces accumulating in the vacation home, I expect millions if not billions of people to erupt once the city flip and not much more. Bunker down vacationers, we promise the Boer Ryk will be swift, sudden and far more stable than in the hands of the Kimberley. And hey, according to the brochere they dropped on you, you’ll be getting free iPads, so that’s cool!
    For real though, can anyone here actually estimate how many people would be lost if the city lost a third of its population? I guess we’ll have to wait for the inevitable won’t we?

    succeeded at another mission forcing a warfront that could’ve been exciting to
    a boring standstill. Sweden ends up holding Constantinople and maintaining many
    of it’s fronts while it seems that Iceland is losing ground on all fronts; and
    this isn’t factoring in the amount of citadels flooding the hollowed out city
    of Cologne. It’s unlikely with the Brazilian menace nearby that this front will
    amount to anything but disappointment, so use this time to bolster your cities

    Mk3 ends up using the Community Patch AI, then we’ll be seeing less of this, which

    world largest city and now thanks to Boer’s heavenly protection, it might grow
    to be healthier and stronger than it ever was. Pictured is a small navy fighting
    the encroaching Boer army. Remember, this army has SkyNet on it’s side, so even
    an evenly matched army wouldn’t fair. Also, whatever happened to the AI between

It’s also protected by Boer territory which has ballooned out of control, even owning tiles in the Black Sea which hosts an empty… carrier… okay, how did that get there? Are we seeing unit teleportation on a naval scale. In fact, yes, we are as there is no way a unit got lodged in the lake just north of Varna. And the planes just off Adrianople.

Europe is in shambles and now the Boer is done with Vietnam; a sweep of grey over this area better happen else a sweep of green or orange will come in its place. Gustavus, your life might already be over, so enjoy the small victories while they exist.

    their military to Blackfoot. In actuality, their player didn’t want to play so

  narration: Compared to others, the trade history of Henry Parkes is rather Spartan,
    only receiving for a bit of oil from Exclavia and giving the same amount from
    the Boer core. They seem definitely spartan, but the Furs he got from Mongolia
    were worth their weight in Uranium.

  narration: Boer apparently dislike Vietnam still and Sibir meanwhile Korea and Sibir
    aren’t best buds at the moment. Vietnam is looking to rip the Sri Lankan stain
    off the map to either pretty their lands or to grant relevance to them before
    the non-relevance paradox opens a hole in space and time killing us all. Smart
    move. Blackfoot wants to probably kill Hawaii for the same reason, I’m certain.
    However, unfortunate to my original prediction, it seems like Brazil doesn’t care
    about any empires and only cares about it’s square miles of Paratroopers it will
    no doubt create.

  narration: And right when I make that joke, Brazil just has to go and make me shove
    my foot in my mouth. Thanks Brazil. Australia and Brazil seem to now hate each
    other, which makes sense. They’re both Green and with the eventual destruction
    of Vietnam they need to prove who is best. A war here would be… well, laughable.
    They’ll be exiled to Townsville faster than the opening of Fairly Odd Parents.

  narration: |-
    Uhm… guys? This is… good right? I mean, two of the world powers are denouncing each other is good right? War is good right? Will this game be ended by the New Type of Warfare™…
    Nope, this is actually hype. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the hammer dropped although this declaration means little for the open borders agreement the empires have. Once it expires though, it seems increasingly unlikely that a war will not happen between these two empires. I think Brazil is ready but are we ready for the outcome?

  narration: "I repeat, are you ready for the outcome? \nSibir is the farthest away
    from Brazil but even then the entirety of Boer core is now stuffed. A war would
    see the most amount of units and population death pretty much in the entire game
    history combined. It would be glorious, so there’s that. This overflow has effectively
    halted the taking of Hebron by the ever brave Sibir worker and maintains the iron
    grip that Sibir has on Yerevan. My only thought right now is what’s going on through
    Krugers mind as his continent becomes overrun."

  narration: Meanwhile in a sane spot of the world not dominated by Brazil’s obsurd
    navy, we see the front pushing every so farther back as the battle goes to Leningrad
    and Kharkov. We’ve seen so much chaos since this part started but how much farther
    will it go? How much is enough? Meanwhile Leningrad, taking after it’s original
    owner has become a city of the workers staging celebrations on the East side of
    the town.

  narration: Gaza strong! For real, it’s actually pretty up there. Producing over
    184 science in this city is no joke and containing all the National Wonders (and
    soon to be Ironworks) means a lot for this cities growth. The random tile of border
    gore also provides a hefty ten gold. It amazes me how strong this city can be.
    For instance, a game in modern era had my 46 population capital produce a whopping
    222 science, This was with a lot of science buildings and great people improvements.
    To be fair that had 292 production, but that’s incredibly impressive nonetheless!

  narration: Blackfoot declare war on… Kimberley? I mean yeah, sure, but all you’re
    doing is hurting each other’s chances at victory. Still could see some units trading
    blows and freeing up spots for Vietnam to regrow, so it’s useful for someone I
    guess. Still a very puzzling choice.

  narration: With the convention over, the Kimberley carrier fleet retreat for more
    pressing concerns. Perhaps their former capital that was taken or maybe their
    cities in the red, burning alive awaiting a sweet death. It seems everyone hates
    on the Kimberley right now.

  narration: Here we see our competitors. While they’re both compressed by major empires,
    it’s obvious who is on top. If this was a land battle, it would be over and Blackfoot
    would easily be the superior empire. But from this distance, it’s hard to see
    a single city flipping, especially with peacekeepers in the way.

  narration: Kimberley Aboriginals still have things going for them, namely the 81000
    gold in their treasury which actually as we found out is good for rebuilding military,
    they could defend off all combatants here, especially with the paltry melee force
    being tossed their way by the Boers. It’ll be interesting to see who will or will
    not own Kimberley’s holdings. Something tells me neither combatant will have a
    chance.

  narration: Such as Vietnam, who if they declare war would have far more damage.
    I could see them flipping the empire to their satellite states in less than one
    part of turns.

  narration: Let’s not forget Brazil! From the rafters comes Dom “The Judge” Pedro,
    slamming down hard on Pathen in front of the Boer’s like a display of grandeur.
    Oh Kimberley, I don’t know what you did to make the world hate you, but I imagine
    it’s the same forces at play that is keeping the Sri Lankan Non-Relevance Paradox
    in full effect. Pedro, you could’ve doomed the sub with your actions. Let’s just
    hope your judgement is soon and quick, for the sake of our sub.

  narration: Really Gustavus? All the units available to you and you bring out your
    artillery to Kouvola. For shame. Oh wait, it’s a peace deal between them both?
    It seems like Gustavus isn’t happy enough with most of Europe being in shambles
    but is dedicated on bringing the chaos further east. I really am not surprised.
    Both of these empires are barren and need the sheer amount of workers between
    them just to keep working. With Future World improvements becoming the norm, it
    appears that right now focusing on upgrading might be for the best, as well as
    repairing the no doubt dozen of pillaged luxuries in the area. I see four sources
    of dyes smoking alone in this screenshot.

  narration: While we look upon in horror at the sheer amount of units in Sweden’s
    german holdings, we can see the true heavyweight attacking Jandamarra. It’s not
    even close in almost all regards, and the 800k treasury means that while Jandamarra
    can buy a small fleet, Brazil can raise the ocean. This will be an uphill battle
    that’s only reliant on the stream of units flooding in from all directions quantity,
    and direction. Godspeed Jandamarra.

    immortal and has ascended past the mortal realm and into the realm of god. Do
    go ahead and ascend soon, Reon is bored of being the only god in the building."

  narration: Boer’s population once more is ridiculous and as the peace deal is exchanged,
    it seems that Vietnam is just getting worse and worse. Also, please note how much
    Mongolia has seemed to improve despite the absolutely terrible conditions inside
    his empire, actually managing a doubling of his population throughout this part.
    He needs to get internal trade routes going and bad. Speaking of bad, Buccaneers
    despite being a coastal empire is growing slower than expected. He does know that
    internal trade routes with Cargo Ships can keep a flatland Desert city afloat
    right? Oh wait, it’s the AI. I don’t think he knows anything. Keep on drinking
    Morgan.

  narration: Boer’s really have benefited from this war, gaining a lot more hammers
    over the course of it than any empire really should. From Egypt to India, they’ve
    come far and will be rewarded. Sibir is spent and Sweden is as well, their only
    two potential competition that isn’t Brazil. As much as I hate to say it, but
    only Brazil has a chance of stopping them, and I don’t rest my laurels on anything
    Australian being positive.

  narration: Buccaneers, like holy. Please remember Buccaneers are all coastal. Possessing
    that amount of hammers is actually pretty insane. Ocean tiles can, at best contain
    2 hammers per one worked and cannot gain any other improvements, so to see this
    much hammers is insane. I wonder if maybe the AI was favoured to building Workshops
    and other improvements on land and that’s why they are suffering. Imagine if they
    could use this and actually declare war on Inui-... actually no, maybe they could
    declare war on… actually no… not Brazil. Well then, keep on keeping on Buccaneers,
    maybe you’ll make your eventual death a little bit harder for Brazil, Inuit or
    the almighty warmonger Armenia.

    makes me wonder how long other wonders are considered wonders. I mean, once you

People are thinking Brazil could crush this game and they have the least amount of wonders at all. They don’t even have a religion. This is just proof that those who just wonder rush all day long don’t often come out on top. Especially when someone else can take it from you with absolute ease like the Boer Ryk can manage. Also, Babylon doesn’t have a single wonder? Nonsense, we have 10000+ wonders! Our audience. Damn that sounded cheesy, I do apologize.'

    Everyone:
    You know, we were originally going to all narrate every slide at the same time, and as a joke in every slide my narration would be “Lunar is typing” and that’s it, but we scrapped the idea, mainly because it was a joke. However, looking up at the near 4000 words I dumped, I think I need to stay away from the keyboard not only for my sake, but yours. Oh yeah, and Dawkinzz… Jyvaskyla.
    For real though, thanks for keeping around with us and thanks dearly for being who you are. You’ve been exactly what has fueled us to work through sleepless nights and what has fueled us to pull money out of our pocket to keep this show running. The future of the CBR will nevertheless be exciting and we hope everyone enjoys the ride! Till next album and next Tuesday, keep sane sub-goers. /u/Limerickarcher, /r/ReonMonterus and /u/LunarNeedle out!
