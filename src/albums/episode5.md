  narration: "<p>Hello and welcome back to part 5 of CBRX, I’m your narrator for today on reddit as u/Orangechrisy, or Orange for short, which is what I go by on discord. I’m the resident useless piece of crap catgirl on the discord, which you should definitely join, where I regularly get yelled at for not taking care of myself and…Uh...Yeah...I...um...probably need help.</p><p></p><p>...Anyways, I’m here to escape my life by watching a bunch of AIs struggle to fight each other in a gigantic Earth map and you are too, so let’s get into this.</p><p>Coiot: Our new Intro image comes courtesy of Lunar. As Civs get eliminated, their TV set will become faded (or worse).</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>u/FakeFakeDouble’s wonderful OC here showcases just the absurdity of Algeria’s moves. Honestly, I was rooting for Algeria and they’ve let me down so hard in only a few parts. I was really hoping for their nice cream color to sweep across north and west Africa but those dreams have been dashed.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the power rankings it seems the Khamugs have retaken the top spot. I’m still a bit unsure on these rankings as they haven’t done anything yet, but if they do start moving they will likely steamroll any of their neighbors. Maybe that will happen this part, maybe it won’t, but I can at least be hopeful.</p>"

  scene_title: "Evenk-tually Expanding"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>To start us off we have a shot of the Evenks in their corner of the world. Although Siberia can be extremely hazardous to humans, the Evenks have two settlers out and one of them seems to be moving to settle on the Arctic Sea. </p><p></p><p>Also here we can see the formations of Scoutcon 1160 BC.</p>"

  scene_title: "Empty Lands"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we can see the Kazakhs in all their...glory? The recently founded city of Isfijab looks well settled on its river and they have 2 more settlers out, likely ready to go settle the Parthian front lines. On the note of Parthia, the entire Kazakh army is up in the Urals and around Sauran, two great generals sit around their capital, and there seems to be no movement of troops south. Ablai Khan doesn’t seem to quite understand what’s going on in this game.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Plight of Toronto"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Canada looks to have repelled the spearmen around Toronto, but it’s still surrounded by the Iroquois and Poverty Point has a warrior two turns away. Canada also has a small group of reinforcements around Ottawa but they aren’t sending them in. Poor Canada just can’t seem to catch a break. </p>"

  scene_title: "Big Brother Alaric"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Over in Eastern Europe we can see the conflict between Muscovy and Prussia is still at a stand-still as Muscovite men continue to throw themselves at the walls of Danzig. Prussia also seems to be getting their army together and could maybe be sending it Ivan’s way.</p><p></p><p>In other better and more interesting news, there are no less than 5 settlers on this slide, 2 in Prussia trying to figure out where they can settle and 3 in the upper right corner from the Goths, looking to box Muscovy in with cities as Ivan probably pouts to Alaric, “It’s not like I wanted you to surround me, b-baka”.</p>"

  scene_title: "Korean Turnaround"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Wooo! Korea actually manages to take Pyongyang back from Shikokoof and it looks like they will hold it as the Japanese navy is nowhere in sight. 22 turns after the city fell the first time Seonjo can proudly proclaim that the Korean peninsula is definitely his. Sorry to any Shikoku fans, maybe they will invade the wide open Ba’arin?</p>"

  scene_title: "Settlers-Ho!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The settler game is afoot. The Aztecs have founded Tlatelolco even nearer to the Apache then their previous city. Along with this, Yup’ik, the Apache, and Poverty Point all have settlers with warrior protection on this slide. Wonder when they will settle.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Turks, Schmirks"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>As could be seen since slide one, Mehmed has peaced out with the Czechs without taking Ostrava, the city lives another day. Even more worryingly, Mehmed is just about completely boxed in with maybe one city around where Izmir is IRL, if they can beat Palmyra to it of course. I would say that the Turks are completely out of the running after this, I don’t even think they could take Malia off of Minoa if they tried.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Otrarian Collapse"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Parthians send Otrar to yellow and have the city surrounded. Sadly for them they have one half health warrior nearby and that’s it, their other melee units are stuck behind the large amount of bows. If the warrior dies then maybe, just maybe, Ablai Khan can hold the city until his non-existent reinforcements arrive. Oh wait... Non-existent? Maybe the city will fall, eventually.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Jesus Christchurch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>New Zealand managed to flub their invasion so badly that the weak and dying Murri fleet was able to damage Christchurch. I don’t know what Seddon is planning but it clearly isn’t a good plan.</p><p></p><p>Also on this slide we can see the city of Darwin, founded at the very end of the last episode, where it leaves Murri with one small gap to reach the rest of the continent and their settler doesn’t seem to be headed that way.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Bergen-ing a War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The newly founded Viking city of Bergen is shown here giving them even more control of Sweden, although the Sami could settle right where that settler is. The Vikings also have another settler in their capital ready to go. But enough of that, war is here!</p><p></p><p>Prussia declares war on the Vikings and a trireme instantly tries to damage Roskilde, to not much success. I don’t know how big the Prussian navy is so this war might just end up being nothing, or maybe they will send a large invasion across the Baltic. Would be unlikely, but exciting. I have also been informed that the Czechs joined the Prussians in declaring war but they can’t do anything. Havel is just trying to get on the Prussians good side.</p>"

  scene_title: "Aw Manx"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Manx’s invasion of the HRE went just as well as you expected it to as the two nations peace out soon after Illiam Dhome faces the Dutch coast and realizes “Hey wait a minute, that’s not water”.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "*Sigh*-naq"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ignoring my terrible attempt at a terrible pun there (and there will be many more), the Kazakhs found Sighnaq right next to the Parthian city of Zadracarta, with two more settlers eyeing up the place as well. </p><p></p><p>In terms of Otrar, both the city and the Parthian warrior are in the red, will it stay alive long enough to take the city? Will the city continue to survive until Ablai Khan’s patented “Non-existent Reinforcements” arrive.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Korea... Victorious!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Seonjo manages to peace out with Shikokoof just before their navy arrives, keeping Pyongyang in their hands. Our boys in pink have had quite the successful day it seems, they even have a settler out ready to settle more lands. Hopefully they don’t get attacked by the Qing anytime soon. </p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Swimming with Sulu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we get a shot of the South China Sea, or in this case the South Canton Sea, or maybe the North Sulu Sea? I’ll go with that one. The North Sulu Sea remains empty of cities and units. The Sulu on the other hand have filled their waters with their UU the Proa, ready to defend against anyone who wants to attack them for whatever reason. This is all good and all but they really should be building more settlers to fill out Borneo, the Philippines, and maybe even land in Vietnam.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Preying on Palmyra"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyra faces two war declarations from the Goths and the Turks, and I have been told the Prussians also join in on this quest to save Oman. The Turks are really the only people here that can do anything to Palmyra and I don’t see them getting their army through Constantiniyye anytime soon to take Hierapolis. Although these war declarations might pull Palmyran troops away from Nakhal allowing Oman to retake the city. C’mon Oman, you got this!</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "The End of the Great Trek"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Qing have finally used that settler they sent out so long ago to settle the Kamchatka peninsula with Fuzhou. The Yup’ik citizens from across the Bering Strait kinda go “Hey I think I see something over there, should we check it out?”“Nah, let’s stay here and continue to not do anything, it’s not like crossing the strait will help us grow and expand or anything.”“Oh yeah, you’re right.”</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Danziggian Defense"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Is Danziggian the right word? No idea. Not sure there even is a good adjective for Danzig. Oh well, there’s action to be had. The Muscovite archers have brought Danzig down to red but there isn’t a melee unit ready to capture it as the nearest one is two turns away and fortified. AKA, never gonna do anything.</p><p></p><p>In other news, the Sami still haven’t settled with that settler in Sweden, maybe they’re still bummed about the Bergen spot being taken from them. </p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Otrarian Nightmare"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Otrar falls! The Parthians bring in their unique horseman replacement the Grivpanvar, a slow but powerful unit that grants extra bonuses if garrisoned on a conquered city. The Parthians continue to move north towards Almaty, although the city has more units around it to defend. Ablai Khan wonders to himself how his patented “Non-existent Reinforcements” didn’t save the city. His two settlers are moving on their way though, with one still unsure where to go and the other moving to the southern shores of Lake Balkhash, with a large scout entourage to protect it. </p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Kazakhs have begun production of their unique unit the Tolu-Batyr, a strong horsemen replacement ready to beat back the Parthian hordes. </p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "It’s Nakhalright"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyra Settles Callinicum and Germanicea in western Arabia, stopping any thoughts of Minoan expansion into the region. Callinicum’s position on the red sea near Mt. Sinai also looks to provide them with a starting base to dominate the waters around Arabia. Oman looks like they are trying to consolidate a force to go take back Nakhal but it looks unlikely to do anything with the large Palmyra army along the Euphrates. Maybe they will send some units north to fight the Turks but it’s unlikely. </p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Tlemcen 2: Electric Boogaloo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Abdelkader decides to refound Tlemcen, in a spot that is even more surrounded by Songhai. It looks like Abdelkader will be purchasing one patented Non-existent Reinforcement package to defend the city when war inevitably breaks out again. For now they just have to hope Songhai doesn’t want to fight them again and that the jungles around the city can hold off the Songhai army. </p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Hah, Urugay"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sorry about that one, I just think taking the third “u” away makes their name funnier. Uruguay have decided to found Maldonado and Rivera, aptly named for being on a river, with their third settler still heading north into the jungles of Brazil. They also have quite the army hanging around just in case a certain Eldritch Horror decides to invade from below. </p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "An Independent Army"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Zimbabwe settles Chitekete right next to the Madagascar colony and they have two more settler hanging around Dhlo-Dhlo. </p><p></p><p>More importantly, I figured out what the Zimbabwe army is doing. The army has rebelled against Nyatsimba Mutota and have established the Free Independent State of Epulu (after the Epulu river going through their state), under a military junta. This state controls much of Central Africa, bordering Lake Tanganyika in the northeast, Ndongo to the west, and their recent overlords Zimbabwe in the south. Due to being formed out of an army, they enforce much of their rule over the small tribes and groups of people in the area through force. I have much hope for these guys.</p>"

  scene_title: "Aussie Fight 2: Electric Boogaloo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yes, I am using that same joke twice within 5 slides, what are you gonna do about it? That’s right, nothing. Well… you might complain about it in the comments or on discord and I’ll be saddened but you guys wouldn’t do that, would you?</p><p></p><p>The Murri finally settle another city with Boob-heh-arran Ngummin. And Australia also has a settler near Uluru, whether they will settle the hill or not still remains uncertain. </p><p></p><p>Oh yeah, the actual topic of this slide, Bob Hawke declares war on the Murri again, their large army, superior production, and them surrounding the Murri looks like this war is set in stone already. Although I wouldn’t hope that much, there is still pretty rough terrain and some mountains in the way so Ganuuru might come out of this alive.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Missing Navies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>A view of the Tasman Sea shows no one having a navy here to speak of, besides New Zealand having one, although it’s on the wrong side of the island. Here we can also see the Australian offensive into Gunnedah, doesn’t look like it will do much though with a mountain in the way and the lack of any ranged units. </p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Another One"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another shot of the conflict? Alright then. Nothing new is shown here other than getting a better overview of the war, and showing that yes, New Zealand did in fact manage to destroy those three low health triremes attacking Christchurch. </p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "War Nenets-ually"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Nenents and Kazakhs continue small fighting in the tundra forests where neither civ can actually do anything to each other and it’s just a slow meat grinder until they make peace. Guys please make peace. Please. Just a little peace...</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Gettin’ the Boot"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>As we look upon the absolutely horrific failure of Algeria to take Benghazi, a wild Torcello makes an appearance. Venice finally got their settler down here and found the city on the tip of the boot, just perfect for a navy to take.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Indus Time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Maratha continues their settling spree by founding Sinhagad just southeast of the Indus River. Although the city has zero natural defenses, Maratha does have an army around, and a bigger presence then Indira has in the area. On that, Indira has a settler ready but not going yet and has most of her army gathering near Nepal, hmmm….</p>"

  scene_title: "Newly Found Land"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Newfoundland is showcased here along with a bit of Greenland, the area completely empty save for a few scouts. No idea why these empty barren lands are shown so let’s check out the sidebar. The Evenks make a diplomatic declaration of war against Canton as a show of support for Taungoo, who also declare war. Along with this, the Prussians also back up the Moors in attacking Venice. The Prussians are now in something like 5 wars or so where only two matter. </p><p></p><p>Also while we’re here, a reformation belief is added to some religion, I don’t know which but it was one of them. There was also a reformation belief added a few turns ago that I didn’t mention. </p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Danzig or Peace"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Danzig has finally fallen to the Muscovite horde as archers from both sides try to maintain control over the city. The Muscovite UA comes into play here as the Prussian cities take a chunk of damage.</p><p></p><p>Also in this slide we can see the Sami settler slowly heading back to their heartland along with a large amount of Boazovázzi, the Sami UU, which can temporarily remove resources from the game to give food and production to a city. Hopefully they don’t get too crazy in their removal of natural resources.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Almaty Hopes are Gone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Parthians begin damaging Almaty has Ablai Khan struggles to figure out why his patented Non-existent Reinforcements aren’t doing anything. He also can’t decide where to settle as he’s kept one settler completely still since the last time we were here. Anyways, we need to believe harder in his Non-existent Reinforcements and then maybe they will do something, unlikely as it is. </p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Plains of Gold"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Back in the midwest and Rockies, the Apache are the next civ to use their settler, founding Shis-Inday north of the Poverty Point capital and just west of Montreal. The Poverty Point settler turns and starts heading more north instead of west to get around Lepai-Nde. The Yu’pik settler continues heading south as it finds itself at what I believe is the Colorado river. None of the civs here really have an army pointed at any of the others, in frame at least.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Unnamed General"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Moors declaration of war on Venice is backed by a massive army around Balansiyyah. The army seems to have an actual composition to it with a good mix of catapults, warriors, and archers. The Venetians on the other hand are caught with nothing but two archers and a great general. It would probably be wise at this point for me to ask BC what that general’s name is and for me to write some small thing about them, but I won’t ask that, so you’ll have to give the general a name yourself.</p><p></p><p>[General’s Name] stood on the walls of Murano, looking tired and worn out. His campaign during the war with the HRE left him weak and overworked. Now, with the approaching Moorish army, [General’s Name] welcomed defeat, welcomed death to his door and invited him in for tea. [General’s Name] knew the city he loved and wanted to protect would fall and burn as Enrico Dandolo continued to ignore the need for military. [General’s Name] wanted nothing more than to see Murano thrive, for it to stand tall as a mighty flourishing city in the heart of the wine fields of Europe. But [General’s Name] knew it would not come to be, for now [General’s Name] could only hope that the Moors were gracious in their conquest, and that the city could continue to live under their rule. </p>"

  narration: "<p>We finally get the first shot of the Taungoo Empire in a long time, maybe the first one, I don’t really know. I’m not an expert. Anyways, Taungoo decided the Cantonese city of Sum Chen should be theirs. Now, they don’t seem to have the army in place to take it, but it’s the thought that counts. They might bring their troops over eventually and actually prove themselves worthy of always having a high ranking in the PR.</p>"

  scene_title: "An Interesting Conflict"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Syke! You thought there would be something of substance here and you’re wrong. It’s yet (not) another earth map pa- uh, I mean, it’s the Tasman Sea conflict again. The only thing new here is that Hawke is trying to conquer Gunnedah with only two spearmen, this wont go well for him.</p>"

  scene_title: "Deja Vu, I’ve Just Been in this Parthia Before"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yep, we’re back here where Parthia once again has a Kazakh city down to yellow, surrounded (for the most part at least) by units, they have a single melee unit in range who is at 2/3rds health, and Ablai Khan once again is trying to use his Non-existent Reinforcements to try and save the city. </p><p></p><p>On another note, one Kazakh settler began moving south and I have no idea where the other one went, maybe it went north to make a city on their other frontline.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Fall of Toronto"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Poverty Point warrior went away and it was the Iroquois who managed to finally bring in a warrior of their own to take Toronto. Canada has so far played abysmally and it’s just such a sad sight to see, I had such high hopes for Canifest Destiny 2. But they’ve been dashed by William Mackenzie King who refuses to defend his cities has he’s knocked down to just Winnipeg and Ottawa.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere in this slide an Iroquois settler makes its way into Ohio to found another city, things really are looking up for the Iroquois today, much to my disappointment. There is also the new Metis city of Battleford, where many battles will likely be fought. And the Metis army surrounds the city, they could be heading up to Winnipeg to get their own piece of Canada or they could be heading south to Montreal or Shis-Inday for what would likely be a more useful city.</p>"

  scene_title: "All Quiet on the Eastern Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Prussia still surrounds Danzig and has it in the perpetual black as it tries to find a pathway for their spearmen to get through. They also made peace with the Goths and thankfully didn’t stupidly trade away a city to a non-threat. *cough* Canton *cough* The Gothic army is still looking absolutely massive, maybe they will use it on Muscovy? Or use it at all for anything? That would be good, wouldn’t it? Their settlers have also gone offscreen so I can only assume they are off to the frozen wastes to further surround Ivan-chan.</p>"

  scene_title: "Fruitless Fighting"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nubia is quite effortlessly dealing with the coalition against them, beating back the Songhaians to a peace after just getting done with the Ndongo army. Nothing in danger of falling anytime soon for Piye. In other news Benin has a settler out, heading for the western split of the Nile, while Beta Israel has a settler near Dabat trying to figure out where to go. Overall this mess of troops and civilians isn’t getting anything done though.</p>"

  scene_title: "Actual Fighting"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hawke has positioned troops around Boobarran Ngummin and is beginning to damage it. Will the current army there be enough? No, but they do have more troops in the south that they can bring up. Hawke is also sending a small army towards Cavanbah and has brought an archer with him, already improving. Lastly here, New Zealand has gotten together another small fleet and is trying to sail towards Cavanbah as well. </p>"

  scene_title: "Golden Coasts"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode5-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>We finally get a shot of the Benin core and it seems they’ve been up to some stuff. The new city of Akure sits where Douala is IRL, and is extremely defensible form the south. They also have two more settlers in between Edo and Ughoton, I believe that’s three settler in total that they have, just gotta settle with them. Benin also came down with a plague of random brown lines which is whatever the hell their unique improvement is, can’t say I understand any of it.</p><p></p><p>In terms of military, Benin is brandishing both spearnmen and composite bowmen while the Songhai army to their north is still on the weak archers. Any conflict between them though will likely end in Songhai victory or a bloody stalemate that lasts for far too long.</p><p></p><p>On the sidebar, Benin also makes peace with Piye after failing to hurt them and they build a wonder. As someone who doesn’t know what it is I’ll just let Lime fill in what that does.</p><p></p><p>(Dawkinzz’ Note - Cheomseongdae is that new fangled wonder you might be curious about; an ancient astronomical observatory used for stargazing.  It provides +1 Culture, +3 Science, +1 Great Scientist Points, and most importantly +1 Science for every 3 citizens in the city.  If Benin builds tall, they can become a scientific powerhouse)</p>"

  narration: "<p>Were back to the fields of southern France, the Moorish army has yet to damage Murano but they are making their way over. They also are bringing another settler up to settle the rest of Brittany, or maybe Normandy, or maybe even central France. The HRE also brought their settler back from the area and is currently sitting around Aachen waiting for new orders. But there’s something else here, a certain thing is missing. That’s right, the unnamed general is missing from Murano and I don’t see the great general anywhere nearby. Looks like it’s the end for this poor fellow.[General’s Name] looked upon the advancing army, the size of it larger than anything they had seen before. As the siege machines began to be set up, [General’s Name] stepped forward to greet them. “To whoever this may concern,” [General’s Name] spoke to the advancing army, “I can see the victory of your people over us. The Venetians have abandoned us to you and left us with no support or aid. Although I am required to defend this city I see no hope in doing so. I will put down my sword here and renounce my status in the Venetian Army. I only hope that you do not harm the innocent citizens of Murano, that you may treat the city as one equal to your own, and that under your reign the city maybe grow prosperous.” With that [General’s Name] become not a leader of the Venetian army, but a leader of a city, no matter the owner. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Golden Horde is having quite the exciting slide, they’ve damaged Kuchan. Well, not that exciting. It’s not much at all and won’t lead to anything further as they only have the one trireme. They do however join in the coalition against Palmyra along with the Evenks as seen in the previous slide. They can just about squeeze an army through the mountains of Armenia but it won’t do much against the strong defense Palmyra has around Circesium. They also have a settler out near their capital although they are yet to send them somewhere settleable. Almaty also rests at 0 hp as there are no Parthian melee units right next to it, although there are at least 3 melee units, including one of their unique horsemen, within a turn or two of the city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qin, fresh off their latest war with Canton, build the Terracotta Army, giving them many many free units on top of their already large army. They also have two settlers in frame ready to go off and expand the empire even more. The Khamugs nearby found Manghut hidden in some mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, slowly encircling the Qin. However, they have failed to send more than a few archers to protect this line of cities and the Qin army looks like they have an easy snack on their hands, lets see if they decide to act on it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We get a better look at what I’m dubbing the Kurdish Conflict, you can call it something different if you’d like, but I’m the one writing this so really you don’t get a choice here. The hilly and mountainous terrain lends little to there being any fighting and both sides have larger armies in the area. I don’t see this as ending up as a victory for either side; it’s either going to be a bloodbath or there will be no fighting at all.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Indira declares war on Nepal claiming “It’s too close to us. Also they have uranium.” Nepal is busy sending a settler into the heart of Tibet, which looks like it could hold some great production cities with all the hills and plains around, despite being 5,000 feet above sea level, truly stunning. The actual military conflict however begins with a string push by India towards the city of Gorkha, but the Nepalese army is also large and should be able to defend it. Will this be a repeat of the previous war or will one side reign victorious? I for one am hoping Nepal manages to take Delhi and becomes the dominant Indian power but that’s just a dream.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I am clearly the absolute best at creating names for repeat scenarios. That aside, Gunnedah is still in the green but Hawke has brought an archer over to help, his efforts to attack Cavanbah seem to be fruitless though. In the upper left corner it seems Boobarran Ngummin is taken down to at least yellow, maybe Hawke will have better luck taking that city.</p><p></p><p>But the main portion of this slide seems to be dedicated to the New Zealand invasion of Cavanbah as this time they do not seem to be splitting their navy in two and they can actually focus on the one city. And possibly even take it if they believe enough.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Very important notification has appeared as Songhai returns from their Algerian conquests to turn their army around straight into Benin. They lack the superiority in not having composite bowmen, but they do lead in numbers. There is also a Songhai army in the northeast returning from the failed war with Nubia. Benin also still has their settlers hanging around, maybe they will settle during war time. Hopefully this war has some spicy action and I’m rooting for Songhai to come out on top.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Prussia has come out on top again with Danzig back in their hands and the Muscovite army nowhere around. They will likely keep this for quite a while, maybe they can make peace before Muscovy starts an offensive again. Muscovy does have 3 great generals around Suzdal’ but it is unlikely to change much. On the other side of the Baltic, Prussia brings Bergen to yellow but it doesn’t look like they have the navy to actually take it. Sami has also pulled their settler completely out of the Swedish area giving more room for Ragnar to plant a city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Almaty continues to live as all the Parthian melee units vanish before our very eyes. The city looks to stand for another few turns at least, maybe more if Parthia doesn’t get their act together or if Ablai Khan stops relying on his Non-existent Reinforcements he loves so much. Elsewhere here, one Kazakh settler heads into the Gobi desert to settle instead of where it originally was, which will be much harder to defend. The Kazakhs also have a unit at Zadracarta and maybe they will decide to back them up and to a stronger attack on the city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It seems I was wrong and it was just a visual bug or something, but the unnamed general is still in Murano, overseeing the change in occupation to the Moors. The siege seems to be going without problem except for the almost dead warrior, although there are a few more warriors nearby ready to fill in. They also have a settler still heading up the French coast. But that doesn’t matter, let's take a look at what [General’s Name] is doing. </p><p></p><p>[General’s Name] stood in the local capital building of Murano, overseeing the transcription of many of the documents into the Hassaniyah Arabic while also learning the language better themself. [General’s Name] paced around the building, making sure everything was in order as the Moorish troops slowly worked their way through the city securing the streets from the small amount of Venetian rebels who still thought they had a chance. It was not a situation one would want to be in, but given the barbarians to the north and the lack of aid from the capital, it was only inevitable. [General’s Name] took a break and climbed to the roof of the building to overlook it’s small sprawl. Taking a deep breath of the nighttime air,  [General’s Name] thought to themself, “For as long as I’m alive I will watch over this city and keep it from ruin, today was no different.''</p>"

  narration: "<p>Minoa also folds out of the Nubia Coalition, but give up Gournia to the rapidly advancing Nubian army, right? Oh, there is no threat to the city. This is where it pays to like Nubia more than Minoa cause it means I get to be happy about this peace and laugh at Minoa instead of being sad about stuff like I was when Canton decided they didn’t want to participate anymore. So good on Piye for managing to get a city out of this, they are looking to be a strong power in Africa if they can keep their performance up.</p>"

More stuff on this slide includes but is not limited to; a Venezuelan settler heading past the mountains into the middle of the Amazon, a Nazca settler around Estaqueria looking to settle near to the Kuikuro capital again, and decent sized armies from everyone in frame, although Kuikuoro’s seems to be more on the weak side. Maybe there will be more conflict here in the near future. </p><p></p><p>As it hasn’t been mentioned yet, Nepal also declares war on Canton but they are nowhere near to them and won’t be able to have an effect on the war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kazakh’s settler reached success with the founding of Tashkent, and more importantly, they seem to have placed it right before Indira was going to claim it. Parthia also has a settler in Hecatompylos that has to look elsewhere if they want to settle. In terms of Almaty, it’s still in black, still no melee units around it, and the Kazakhs have a few troops around the city protecting it. But it seems more that the Kazakhs are going for the approach of just surrounding Parthia in cities faster than they can take them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The more important thing that was seen last slide was that Poverty Point and Metis declared war on the Iroquois, I assume because of the conquest of Toronto. From what we can see here, Metis moved their army away and are just here for moral support. Poverty Point doesn’t have many units around Montreal, and with the new Iroquois settle of Hostayuntwa in Ohio, it looks like Poverty Point will end up defending  more than attacking in this war. Although if we get a better shot of the conflict maybe they will have the upper hand. I’d also like to point out Saint-Louis De Langevin is still at one pop despite being founded last part and that Canada has another settler out, maybe they will use it better this time.</p>"

With a few composite bowmen and spearmen for days it looks like they have a chance at the city. They also have their two settlers in the north hoping to find a suitable location to plop down a city.</p><p></p><p>The Goths, as big as they are, remain motionless and unwavering.

  narration: "<p>Ah, here is the better picture, why it wasn’t right after the first one I don’t know. Either way, we can now see that Poverty Point can possibly hold Montreal as they have a huge army in the central US. This army looks to be heading northeast as a relief for Montreal and to make a move on the New Iroquois city. They also brought their settler back from near Apache land, maybe they too decided it was a better idea to settle these vast forests to their east instead of letting the Iroquois have free reign.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We’re back in the North Sulu Sea for some reason to notice almost nothing! What I can see here is that Sulu is continuing to beef up and not build settlers while Taungoo have a settler on the edge of the screen making their way down into the region. Sulu do have a large 18 pop capital though, so that’s something I guess. I’ll also take this moment to point out that another reformation belief has been added to someone’s religion.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Beta Israel settles another city, Ambober, on the Somalian coast in a good spot. They also have two more settlers around Gondar which could potentially fill out the rest of the horn if they wanted to. Although they still haven’t claimed Lake Victoria yet so maybe they could get on that instead? Another thing to point out here, Beta Israel does have an army, but it’s mostly warriors and archers, no spearmen or composite bowmen here.  Madagascar in the south, just barely on screen, should really be getting more mainland settles before it’s too late.</p>"

Mutota is wasting no time to set up his own control over the area through three settlers. It’s more and more looking like the army will get forced back into service under Mutota’s iron grip.</p><p></p><p>Ndongo also has a settler out, if it means anything. They will likely have their settle locations taken away by Zimbabwe as they continue to sit idly by in what will be a repeat of the Mk2 Boers except Zimbabwe doesn’t have to fight to take the Zulu cities. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Yeah, that’s right, I did that same joke one last time. For our last slide, we’re back at the never ending Tasman Sea Conflict. Cavanbah falls to yellow through the New Zealand navy. But it looks like they don’t have the ships necessary to take it. They’ve even sent a ship off to attack Gunnedar, splitting their navy just as they did last time. If they send more triremes over they may take it, only may. For Hawke’s side, things have kind of fallen apart as Boobarran Ngummin goes back to green as Murri look to hold the city.</p><p></p><p>As this is the last slide, taking a look at the minimap to see what I missed I notice: a city on the southern coast of Iberia for the Moors, a city in Morocco for Algeria that they can actually defend, a city in southern Germany for the Czechs, a city in the frozen north for the Sami just east of their other cities, two new cities for the Khamugs near the Evenks, a new city on the western Mexican coast for the Aztecs, a new city in Costa Rica for Venezuela, a new city in Florida for the Iroquois, and a new city just east of the Kuikuro for Uruguay. That should be all the settles missed this part but correct me if I missed any.</p><p></p><p>Will Cavanbah finally fall? Will New Zealand ever bring enough ships and only focus on one city with those ships? Will we ever get to see another picture of the Haida where they will hopefully have another settler out as there has been no mention of them or pictures of them for at least two parts now? Find out next time on the Civ Battle Royale Mk X, Episode 6, where I will no longer be your host and you can have a new narrator.</p>"
