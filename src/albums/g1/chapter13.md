  narration: "<p>Yemen has a lot of potential energy, like a rock on a hill, but doesn’t know which way to roll.

The Pahlavis have done it. Shulgi stands no longer, and the great forefather of all civilization sits in ruin. So it goes.Ur has been eliminated in 49th place.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Elsewhere, it seems as though Gilles de Rais’ senseless slaughter of children through the French countryside would be enough of a blood sacrifice. Still, his prayers go unanswered. For every kid that came into the world to die by his hands, he wondered how many he would have to kill to save his nation. Perhaps the eyes of god no longer touch this blood-stained land.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe it wasn’t enough in the first place, Jeanne thought. Perhaps, if a leader needs to succeed, they must believe in their people as much as their people believed in them. As the Illyrian muskets rang through Orleans, the patron maiden gently lowered her flag. So it goes.France has been eliminated in 48th place.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ngurunderi of the Ngarrindjeri is not happy with the Papuans minding their own business, much like colonial Australia, so they decide to interfere in the most predictably violent way. Honestly, it looks like Ngurunderi could deal some major damage.</p>"
