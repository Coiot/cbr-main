  narration: "<p>We’ll begin today’s episode with a pair of recaps from the previous, as we see Azande finishing off that episode with a horde of units coming to lay the smack down on Luba!</p><p></p><p>Don’t worry though Luba fans, they’ve got a steel defense in the form of…. Uh… one trebuchet. Yeah, uh, unless they pull the greatest of peace treaties out of their rear Luba’s beyond fucked.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Last bit of our recap is the frontlines of the Makhnovia-Timurid conflict. While Atil and Marupol still lay in Makhnovia’s hands, their forces are dwindling. All the while, the Timurid assaulting force is still looking fairly strong.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over to the Middle East we seen that Yemen has made peace with the Pahlavis. That’s cool. You know what’s not cool for the Pahlavis? That sizable Egyptian army King Tut is throwing at them. That’s pretty un-cool, I’d say.</p>"

Seems like Brigham’s actually decided to up his forces a bit down here, sending in a couple gatling guns to the front. Maybe he can start messing with Texas now?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yemen’s up next to grab an ideology, the 4th one overall, and it’s yet again Liberalism. It feels weird seeing the big powers prioritize liberalism when in other realities they’re always autocratic or communist dystopias.</p><p></p><p>Funny how it works, hopefully we see a bit of a mixup for our next ideology?</p>"

Sierra Leone’s also looking to grab a bit more territory, sending their unique units to Kipushya.

I guess you can say that’s pretty Mari-mpolite huh? *cue sitcom laugh track*</p><p></p><p>Moving along from what was undoubtedly the greatest comedic act of the year 1520 AD, this may be as far as the Timurid’s conquest goes as the front line force has pretty much fizzled out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Swedes and Nords make peace, with Uppsala remaining in the Norwegians’ hands, allowing them to essentially lock down the rest of upper Scandinavia! It’s a pretty bad time to be a Swede now: 3 cities and stuck between the Norwegians to the North and Makhnovia to the south, the latter of whom looks to be sending a settler up into Southern Sweden.</p><p></p><p>They just lost a war to Sweden, Nestor.

  narration: "<p>Makhnovia and the Timurids make peace, with Timur managing to keep their new conquest of Atil. From this screenshot, I’d say Timur’s concentration of a good amount of his forces in one place is kinda concerning. It may just be partially showing them off, but the Kazakh military could be worrisome should they eye unfortified Merv, Bukhara and Shahrisabz.</p>"

Weird but alright I guess.</p><p></p><p>They shouldn’t relax just yet (hell they shouldn’t be relaxing at all), Azande units are still crawling all over their territory, and Kipushya’s now down to the red.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a bid to break even from the loss of Atil, Makhnovian forces are now pushing on towards France. It may be a bit tough though, as it seems France is litered with higher-end ranged units, and their unique cannon replacement, the Bombarde-mortier.</p><p></p><p>Also yeah looks like that Makhnovian settler founded a city just outside Sweden’s turf.</p>"

Huh, maybe actually bringing fucking melee units wouldn't have been such a bad idea NOW WOULDN’T IT TUT?</p><p></p><p>The Pahlavis come out of a joint war against the two big powers of the Middle East with a second capital! Was it because of the Pahlavis being absolute tactical geniuses? Not really. Was it because of Egypt’s and Yemen’s incompetence? Definitely more likely.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Looks like a new coalition is brewing against France as Portugal now joins in on the fun! The Makhnovian forces in the top right haven’t seem to have moved, and for the most part look generally outdated against the French army. </p><p></p><p>Also for some reason all of France’s cities have taken a minor amount of damage, but this will almost certainly not amount to anything major.

Hyeondo’s down in the red, and there’s a hefty number of Chinese troops ready to take it.</p><p></p><p>Hell this slides one of many carpets: Rouran, the Mongols, China and even Shu Han have some decent carpets going for them.</p>"
