  narration: "<p>Welcome back to the Civ Grand Royale! My name is ExplosiveWatermelon, I’m your lovely host for today. Let’s talk about the shenanigans that happened last episode, shall we?</p><p></p><p>After lots of bloody conflict, a few events occurred. Notably, Sokoto got eliminated. However, perhaps the biggest subject was a global-scale colonization effort focused on turning regals into rumps. With all that out of the way, let’s get started.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Luba is definitely hitting its stride recently, having devoured most of Sokoto and now going after Sierra Leone. However, they’re still in a tight spot in central Africa.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On the other side of the spectrum is Shang, who have wasted the early game and now look to be eliminated by Sun Yat-Sen’s China in little over a few turns. But, that’s just a guess. Let’s begin, shall we?</p>"

  scene_title: "Sri what I mean"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>Or, so I would say, but I’m gonna use some of these early slides to discuss the position of several civs. The first is Srivijaya, who despite having done nothing noteworthy, has maintained their little corner of the universe. Well, besides Prambanan, which they lost.</p><p></p><p>Srivijaya is actually a naval civ centered around wonders, and their UB is a reworked Candi. The unfortunate news is that Srivijaya has made absolutely no use of their bonuses- even failing to get a religion to make use of Faith gains. Sri Jayanasa is, slowly but surely, digging his own grave. Only time will tell if the Wahgi or Siam are the ones to push them in.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yeah, the Kaweskar are in a bad position. Honest to god, they were a pretty powerful civ in testing, but my suspicions are that a nerf that had to be made might’ve been responsible for their competence. Indeed, they failed to settle more than two cities, and now both of those cities are under siege.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ur is facing a very minor naval siege, but more notable is the lack of attention Yemen is giving to this war. They could easily take those cities, which would launch them into the top tier of CGR civs, but unfortunately I don’t think we can expect much.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the midst of their capital’s naval siege, Shulgi gets the bright idea to give away Uruk to Yemen. ‘Oh, thank god’ Arwa al-Sulayhi must be thinking, as she would definitely have not been able to take that city if not for Shulgi’s incompetence.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Siam’s sizable core looks to serve them well- they’ve taken over most of Southeast Asia and have a solid navy if they want to take over some of their neighbors. However, they have the constant reminder of mortality in the form of neighboring China. They’ll have to play their cards right if they want to pull ahead. Luckily, it shouldn’t be too hard.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a war I honestly haven’t been giving the attention it deserves, Stolp has fallen to red health via Makhnovist siege. The former Pomeranian city might just become a former Russian city as well.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kazakhstan has built a pretty large nation, but are typically overlooked in favor of the more active Timurids. As such, let’s give them the time they deserve to shine.</p><p></p><p>Okay, time over. Let’s move on.</p>"

  scene_title: "March on Marrakech!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marrakech sits at red health, but Portugal’s running out of units to throw at the city! If it doesn’t fall soon, Portugal might lose their opportunity to push into Africa.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Big Boy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>One of our most expansive empires on the cylinder, the Timurids have a really good shot at the top. However, this shot seems to be going overlooked, as the Timurids are doing diddly and squat. True, they took Samandar from Makhnovia, but most of their cities have been settled by them. The Timurids empire isn’t weak, but they’re more a sleeping giant than a rampaging one.</p>"

  scene_title: "Lusophone Home"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Portugal has taken Marrakech from Sierra Leone, but ultimately that seems to have been as much as they can act at this moment. Moreover, it seems to have left them defenseless against invaders, and Braga is taking damage up north.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Lands of Lancaster"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>England’s war with Portugal has yielded some results, but has left their southern lands totally defenseless. However, they do field a decent navy, and their Longbowmen are pretty strong. However, if a war between England and France erupts, it’d look pretty rough for both sides.</p>"

  scene_title: "David and Goliath"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timur, having heard my previous slide putting them down for not declaring enough wars, declares war upon Khazaria! Honestly, a welcome change of pace, but ultimately it seems like they’ll only be able to grab Sarkel.</p>"

  scene_title: "Thomas Peters Out"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our bold leader of Sierra Leone looks over his dwindling forces and his diminishing empire. Sierra Leone sits at 4 cities, and is surrounded by larger powers on all sides. That empty core may soon be flooded by enemies, and it seems as though the rising star of CGR is about to become another setting sun.</p>"

  scene_title: "When in Good Compagnie"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>New France puts up a ferocious assault on the city of Hukunduka, although they don’t field that many melee units. However, of the ones they do put out, they seem to be their Unique Unit, the Marine Compagnie. However, the Marine Compagnie isn’t too useful in combat, being more of a utility unit overall with a slight bonus to embarked movement.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene21.jpg

  scene_title: "Burn Down for What"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of being put to flames, Hukunduka is captured and torched as well. Honestly, I wasn't expecting it this soon, but that’s what I get for not having narrated this chapter sooner.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Wen in Shan, do as the Rourans do"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Wenshan is at half health, but a siege of crossbowmen isn’t going to be enough to take this city in. They’ll need a melee unit if they wish to capture the last Shu Han city- and if this invasion fails, Shu Han might be sticking around as a thorn in the side of Rouran for a while.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Don’t Fear the Reefer"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The United Fruit Company fields one of the most colorful banners for one of the darkest civs. Nevertheless, they’re doing pretty well. They maintain 6 cities due to the help of their UU, the Reefer- a cargo ship replacement that plants bananas. However, the main issue the UFC faces at this moment is their diminutive military for a nation of their size.</p>"

  scene_title: "Shopping Qart"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>I can’t lie- Carthage has a pretty decent army but I can’t see it going anywhere. What’s more, their navy is non-existent. That’s not good for a naval civ. I can easily see Carthage being a power in the Mediterranean, but if this is their performance so far? I doubt it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Granada is at half health due to Luba’s invasion force, but I’d look at the new peace deal Sierra Leone was able to forge- the war with Portugalis over. It’s now up to Luba to take out one of the most promising players in Africa.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mongolia is one of the more powerful civs in Asia, but considering there’s a lot of powerful Asian civs, let’s talk about WHY.</p><p></p><p>Mongolia is based around being an expansive civ, and their playstyle has shown that they can settle a lot. Their biggest issue right now is that they’re sandwiched between a lot of powers, and none seem easy to invade. However, the same goes for Mongolia- as it stands, they’re a large citadel. All that remains to be discovered is who will be able to make the first move?</p>"

  scene_title: "Cylinder Theatre"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter7-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Deseret empire has been known to be very wide, and that’s pretty much the extent of it. Unfortunately for us, their lack of involvement in local wars means we haven’t really gotten a chance to show them off. It seems, despite their expansion, they field a rather mediocre military. However, they continue to pump out settlers like Illumination pumps out bad animated movies.</p><p></p><p>Consistently and without surprise.</p>"

  narration: "<p>France is not only sieging Norwich to 1 HP, but Budapest now sits at 1 health as well! But, Jeanne d’Arc should watch her back- it looks like Tours is under a naval siege that could turn sour fast. It would do France well to remember that the best defense is a good defense.</p>"
