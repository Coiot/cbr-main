  scene_title: "Chinese Fortunes"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>As some might recall, the last chapter saw a few dramatic happenings, including a shocking rise to power for China as they invaded neighboring Shu Han. However, looking at the map, it doesn’t seem like they’re done just yet- they still have a few units to spare, and some extra settlers too. Be careful, for as a famous Chinese idiom goes: 有勇無謀.</p><p></p><p>Other events included war between Yemen and Ur, Texas’ fall from grace, and a rather forgettable Hundred Years’ War occurred.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tygyn Darkhan (The Yakuts) has built a pretty sizable empire for himself, but he needs to find an opening if he wants to invade the steppes. Currently, that tundra isn’t going to afford him much luxury.</p>"

  scene_title: "A little bit of everything all of the time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>Unfortunately for me, this chapter starts off with IMMEDIATE ACTION as Mongolia actually puts Rouran on the defensive. This might come as a surprise to our power rankers who have usually witnessed the opposite. Also, over in Europe...</p>"

  scene_title: "Szeget gud"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>Szeged has been given up in a peace deal to France, thus ending the regent Horthy’s desire to create a sprawling kingdom for his youthful monarch, who we have still not actually seen. In other news, France is doing pretty good, creating a sprawling empire across Europe.</p>"

  scene_title: "David vs. Goliath"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Balanjar teeters on the brink of destruction- the Khazar government-in-exile’s capital basically consists of a few rocks to sleep on. However, they retain the city for now.</p>"
- scene_number: 07
  scene_title: "Sayonara, Sahara!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>A lone Portuguese settler wanders the grand Sahara, allowing us to get a glimpse of the West African empires being carved. Sierra-Leone has a modest 3 cities, the Almohads have 4, and Sokoto is stuck at 2. While the situation may look grim for Sokoto, their eponymous capital has a pretty sizeable population compared to their neighboring capitals.</p>"

  scene_title: "Basotho Base"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>In Southern Africa (not to be mistaken for South Africa) we can find the most peculiar civ in light blue- Lesotho. TranquilSilence’s lone entry into the royale, this civ has some late game uniques, replacing the Gatling Gun and the Observatory. However, they do receive some notable bonuses from Declarations of Friendship, however they need a more aggressive approach if they want to go far.</p>"

  scene_title: "Kaweskarred for life"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Jetarkte and Malte are perhaps 2 of the worst cities on the cylinder, but they’re also the only cities on the cylinder for the Kaweskar. Yes, it seems like the Power Rankers put too much faith into the Kaweskar, as they mostly refused to settle and now hold one of the smallest empires on the planet. We can’t even see if they have their Unique Cargo Ship, the Wallef.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Perhaps the Choctaw have a rather decent shot at success, somewhere in here. However, it does not lie in this war with the Shoshone, in which they have already lost the city of Doaksville. Now, a rather intimidating military presence is starting to form around Bok Chukfi Ahiliha. Pushmataha better prepare for the worst.</p>"

  scene_title: "Wriggle away"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rouran seems to be holding itself together well, despite the Mongolian invasion. The reason, I’d suggest, would be the presence of their UU- the Wriggling Rider. Not only does this UU get additional movement, its movement is restored near Freshwater. However, there is a catch- I don’t believe the ability works correctly due to an error elsewhere in the code. It’s a case of bad luck, really.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sarawak’s luck seems to be taking a turn for the worst, as the Wahgi have captured Simanggang. The Wahgi have been proving to be extremely opportunistic in this game, and we can potentially see an empire based in Papua if they continue to play like this</p>"

  narration: "<p>Cascadia.</p><p></p><p>What can be said about Cascadia? Well, they’re competing for what is basically a participation trophy. With 2 cities and several rising empires in North America, what can we expect from them? Personally, I wouldn’t get your hopes up.</p>"

  scene_title: "Omaguaycuru"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>There’s a war in South America, but it’s not as exciting as one would hope- the Omagua and Guaycuru declare war on each other, but there’s a slight problem in Brazil’s existence between the two civs. I don’t expect this conflict to go too far.</p><p></p><p>Good ship name tho for the slide title.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Grenades over Granada"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Okay, maybe that’s an exaggeration because Grenades haven’t been invented yet, but here we are, the major conflict of the episode. Yes, Thomas Peters’ Sierra Leone has declared war upon the Almohads. This looks like it’ll be a decisive conflict.</p>"

  scene_title: "Carnage Carnival"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>That’s not all- do you remember when I said the Omaguaycuru war wouldn’t go too far? Well, I lied. Brazil AND the United Fruit Company join on Guaycuru’s side. However, with the Amazon in the way of any easy battles, it’ll be seen who will take advantage the most of this war.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mongolia makes peace with Rouran, thus ending a conflict that was only too short. However, it’s probably for the best- Mongolia’s army was looking pretty tattered, and Rouran seems like it was holding still.</p>"

  scene_title: "Run A-Mokjeo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter4-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Japan starts sending ships into the port of Mokjeo, starting an invasion that will probably last far too long because triremes aren’t the best siege weapons. However, that’s not to say this is a bad move- indeed, it’s one of Japan’s major chances to get onto the mainland.</p>"

This powerful unit heals after defeating enemies and can permanently increase its strength by pillaging tiles. However, what I want to talk about is the unique religion, and the Missionary UU that we won’t be able to see until the Maravi adopt one. The Maravi have a chance to found the Nyau religion, which is a custom addition that’s included as part of the mod, and ties into their UU: the Nyau Cultist. However, these uniques are only useful if the Maravi raze cities, which they haven’t done yet. Not only that, we have seen every religion that CAN be founded. I simply wanted to bring attention to these aspects that we won’t be able to show off properly.</p>"
