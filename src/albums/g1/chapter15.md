  narration: "<p>Louis de Buade (New France) maintains only a slight portion of his once great empire. Washakie has proven his hegemony over the North American plains, and it seems there is little in his way to pursue further conquests. As for de Buade, it looks like he’s out of the game for now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Home to the largest population of Gatling Guns per capita, the Wenshan Autonomous Republic under Liu Bei (Shu Han) is, quite frankly, a relic. They’re a great civilization who had one fault: they started next to Sun Yat-sen. Really, it’s hard to blame them for getting into this position, but that’s show business baby.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Eystein (Norway) decides to put on his big-boy pants for once and retake the city of Reykjavik. Honestly, it’s probably too late for either of the Scandinavian civs to make any gains- they’re in a relatively cramped position in Europe and their biggest obstacles are each other. I wouldn’t be surprised if, in a war between the two, Christian (Sweden) would win. Seriously, it looks like our beloved empress has a well-maintained army in addition to a sizable navy. Norway might be bigger, but has nothing to show for it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a slide so flavorless the British call it food, the White Huns adopt Liberalism. In all fairness, this gives us a chance to see their core in which they still field both UUs for some reason. They also field Great War Infantry, Cavalry, and… Pikemen… This isn’t so much as a unit composition, moreso a unit Guernica. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Gwanggaeto (Goguryeo) loses the valuable core city of Jolbon, and Tygyn Darkhan (Yakutia) decides to raze it down. With no melee units in the vicinity for either side, I don’t think the city’s gonna flip soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Marajoara has a single cannon and a Great Musician. How are they still alive? Well, that 12 population city also happens to have 79 defense, and the bordergore around the city makes invasion a hassle. Whenever the Omagua wake up, I suspect they’ll roll over Marajoara and leave a weird orange-red stain on the cylinder</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the CBR discord, I was discussing with some of the readers how I felt that the Azande are pretty cool, and there were some comparisons made to the Boers. While Paul Kruger was cold and calculating, Gbudwe (Azande) is the exact opposite- he’s a hot-headed warmonger who conquers with brutal efficiency. Honestly, I love it. </p><p></p><p>From my experience, a lot of AI games have these civs that use brute force to conquer, but they only ever manage to take 2 cities. Gbudwe absolutely wiped out Sierra Leone in 1 part. They could practically direct their army anywhere in Africa- with the only risk they would face being the Yemeni Order. This Great Orange Blob is a serious threat, and one who’s willing to get his hands dirty.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Norwegian-Finnic treatise of 1905 goes on the record to state that the territory of Uppsala would be sacrificed to the ravenous hordes of the Eastern Finns, with the only concession that Tyushtya had to make was to publicly state that ‘Eystein I never cried or wet himself during the negotiations.’</p><p></p><p>“You know,” one Norwegian citizen is reported as saying, “I think he DID cry and wet himself during the negotiations.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a lesser-viewed angle of Papua, we see that a bunch of very small islands have been claimed by the Ngarrindjeri. Bol’im (Wahgi) doesn’t have any boats to conquer them with, so these could potentially be the staging ground for Ngurunderi’s (Ngarrindjeri) naval invasion. At least, that’s what I hope happens- I don’t know how many more slides of Bourges I can fill this chapter with.</p>"

Here we have two civs who have blown their chances against all odds- Khazaria who had defeated Makhovia in most tests, only to lose in the final game, and the Maravi who… Well, they typically didn’t lose as fast as this.

  narration: "<p>I’ve never really talked about Portugal at the length they deserve, so let me clear this up: Carlos I has put on a fascinating performance. They’re clearly one of the more powerful civs in the region, perhaps even capable of taking down England, and they haven’t let us down yet. However, they show only moderate aggression even when faced with a war on their home continent. Indeed, their interests lie mostly in their colonies- such as those in Africa.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Veselaya Yevreyka has taken marginal damage since we last saw it, giving me the opportunity to talk about Yemen!So, I was sharing this in the CBR discord the other day, but I actually had a head-canon for Yemen in particular in order to explain their nature in this game:Yemen is not a country but a secret organization. Arwa al-Sulayhi is their ‘Grand Commander’ because she commands the operations they undertake. They’re the most powerful because they’ve set up monasteries in various different countries in order to recruit soldiers for their homeland- hence their incredible military advantage and thriving population. However, they don’t declare large-scale wars because doing so would be revealing the size of their operation. Thus, they only work on minor operations, such as the siege of Veselaya Yevreyka.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Illyrians adopt Liberalism, but let’s face it, that’s not interesting enough, so here’s another head-canon:Teuta has been regent for the kingdom of the Illyrians for a long time- perhaps most of the game. This is because she’s using necromancy on the REAL Monarch- the one who would be the immortal leader of the royale- to siphon their never-ending lifespan for her own means. By acting as regent, she gets full control over the country, while the REAL immortal gets to live a seemingly average life.</p><p></p><p>But we know the truth.</p>"

He also fields his Unique Unit, the Literacy Corps (which might’ve already been discussed.)</p><p></p><p>One thing I’ve noticed is that the Pahlavis are rather small. They’re one of my favorite civs in this game, actually- having conquered their way into semi-relevance. They have a few possible options for expansion, but overall they field an impressive military and have proven themselves repeatedly. Despite all that, they have little to show for it. How come?</p>"
