  narration: "<p>Hello and welcome to Episode 11 of the Civilization Grand Royale, hosted by ExplosiveWatermelon, Coiot, and the whole /r/CivBattleRoyale showrunning team! My name is /u/Weasel_Man, and boy do I have an exciting part lined up for you.</p><p></p><p>It’s been a dream to narrate a CBR episode for a long time - I, like I’m sure many of you, have been following this crazy community since the very first Battle Royale by /u/thenyanmaster almost seven years ago. I’m grateful to the showrunners for giving me this opportunity to write an enormous amount outside of a grad school context. Without further ado, let’s get on with the simulated bloodshed!</p>"

  narration: "<p>To catch everyone up from last week’s riveting episode, we begin on the East Coast of North America with a look at New France. Louis de Buade was very hyped coming into the Royale (with a Part 0 ranking of #3!), and proved to make quick work of their other New rival. While their conflicts have cooled off substantially, let’s have a look at that core!</p><p></p><p>Very healthy build-up here, staring down the...very empty barrel of the Shoshone. When they do face off (and mark my words, they shall), it’s bound to be legendary - a #1 prelim rank against a #3 doesn’t come around every day. Not sure if they’ll be the next target of the army, however, with those four embarked cannons off the coast. Can’t do much with ‘em there, de Buade!</p><p></p><p>A skirmish takes place outside Richardson, and the enigmatic Houston retains control.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And, a war which started as an odd declaration from Sierra Leone has morphed into an existential threat for Dido, as the coalition descends on all sides. Portugal and Yemen are poised to do the most damage. I can’t say I expect Carthage to put up much of a fight. Qart Hadasht seems a particularly ripe prize for the plucking, at a central Mediterranean location and with an impressive 23 population (and that’s after an embargo!).</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Dido’s Great Admiral would be of more use if he had ships to command rather than outmoded crossbows.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, up north, France continues to be at the pointy end of Illyria’s big stick. Time will tell if the brave defense of Venetian Paris amounts to much.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On with the show! And jumping right into the thick of it too, as the Azande finally begin to bear down on Luba. Mwibele is already lower than half health, and if it were to fall, Katende would be easily approached. Gbudwe just has to keep that one lancer alive, as the rest of his melee units are spread to the wings.</p><p></p><p>The Maravi and Sweden have decided to put aside their petty differences, realizing they forgot what they were fighting about in the third place. They end up getting Thai takeout and renting Kung Fu Hustle.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shifting over to good ol’ Terra Nullius, the Ngarrindjeri have battered Jandamarra’s doors well enough and have Bandilngan down to 1 HP! This would appear to be wretched news for the Bunuba, unless of course, Ngurunderi forgot to bring a melee unit to the fight.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Ngarrindjeri only have one melee unit on the entire screen, a measly trireme in the bottom right! The tech advantage is clearly in their favor, but strategy may not be a strong suit.</p><p></p><p>The Ket and the Guaycuru realize they want to join the movie party too, and make peace.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Returning to a dismal Carthage, where the capital is nearly at half health! Surrounded on all invadable tiles by Portuguese privateers, it seems Yemen may not have much of a chance for the capture. The same can’t be said of Hippo Regius, however, which could be assimilated into their queen’s Mediterranean holdings with a wave of her hand.</p><p></p><p>Illyria continues to fail in the conquest of Paris. The unit supremacy is there, it just needs to be carried out!</p>"

  scene_title: "Maravi wants its mommy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho carves out Mankhamba, reducing the Maravi to one city... on flat land... with only a single crossbowman standing in the way of conquest. I’d start numbering the days, but lots of Moshoeshoe’s army is very badly damaged indeed.</p><p></p><p>Also of note on this slide, take a look at Yemen’s army! Already on artillery and Great War Infantry, and filling up even her far-flung colonies. I wouldn’t be surprised if Moshoeshoe and al-Suryahi came to blows (and the Arabians came out on top).</p>"

  scene_title: "No pies in Madagascar!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yemen has recruited Oliver Cromwell, the head of the Parliamentary army, to govern Jibla and Mecca. Maybe he’ll convince his queen to begin a great holy war, or maybe he’ll just try to imbue the province with that famous Protestant work ethic. Those colonies certainly seem to be growing like a family of Catholic jackrabbits.</p><p></p><p>With the four ironclads in her arsenal, Yemen could very easily unite all of Madagascar under its warm taupe colors. It’s uncommon to see an Arabian civ perform this well in a Battle Royale, so I’m all for it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We return to Qart Hadasht, which has lost *checks notes* the in-game equivalent of a million and a half Phoenecians in the siege. Carlos has a bloodlust that can only be sated by a capital in his clutches (and maybe Utique too, but he hasn’t made any progress in that respect yet). </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Yemen has begun the assault on Hippo Regius. With Portuguese ships in the vicinity though, we could witness a snipe. Sure to engender bad blood, even among coalition-members.</p><p></p><p>Up north, Paris is still under assault, and Illyria has withdrawn a very almost dead cannon from the front lines.</p>"

  scene_title: "Carthage’s hopes are Qart Hadashed"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>And indeed the Carthaginian capital falls on the very next turn! With it, Carlos extends his control over North Africa even further. He doesn’t seem to be done yet, with Hippo Regius nearly in the red and most Yemeni units withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>Now to see what becomes of Utique, which has yet to be attacked. Maybe Carlos will leave it intact as a monument to eternal Carthaginian ineptitude!</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Azande have finally knocked Luba down to one city with the capture of Mwibele! The capital of Katende is surrounded by pillaged tiles, and now there are enough melee units in the vicinity to take it!</p><p></p><p>Lesotho’s looking mighty empty. It would be a shame if they were the subject of a coalition, hmm?</p>"

  scene_title: "*poke poke* C’mon, do something"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>It wouldn’t be a Battle Royale if some Hunnic or Mongol offshoot didn’t do anything. The White Huns, turtling proudly in the Hindu Kush, are still wielding their UU swordsman replacement, the Xingar-yir. It’s a little late in the game to still be wielding swordsmen, isn’t it, Toramana?</p><p></p><p>They don’t seem to be terribly far behind their neighbors in techs, either, which is the curious thing about it all! But faced with wars, truly only Sakala would be safe.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Jimmu is one of the first civs ever to have united the island of Japan in a BR! But what has he done with all that land? Surely not much in the way of production - a mostly-filled core, but what is that worth with the bloodthirsty Sun Yat-Sen breathing down your neck? And using not one, but two tiles of land at a high premium for archeological sites? Just shows not everyone is in this for the conquering.</p><p></p><p>Hard to say if Maurice of Nassau will make a big splash in the region. Certainly no Spaniards to excise from the Korean Netherlands as in the history of our cylinder. </p>"

  scene_title: "Stop it, she’s already dead!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>With Qart Hadasht firmly in Portuguese mitts, the assault on Utique has begun and the one on Hippo Regius nearly finished. Yemeni melee units are not in position to take the city. Just as well - who would want to border Carlos right now? He’s on the warpath.</p><p></p><p>Thomas Peters might be trying to sneak a unit or two into the conflict over Utique, but that would only serve to antagonize Carlos and stretch his empire thin.</p><p></p><p>Venetian Paris update: still under siege, still at about half health, and not likely to flip hands anytime soon.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Ngurunderi reads the narrations"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>A knight sneaks its way into Bandilngan, and the Ngarrindjeri have taken control. With all those gatling guns to defend with, you’d think it’d be safe from any flips. This doesn’t seem to be Jandamarra’s finest game. He’s sitting in the corner of his war room right now, sipping a piña colada and reminiscing on the glory days of his Kimberley leadership, which ended in... well, maybe it’s not important.</p><p></p><p>The Wahgi are in fairly good shape for a South Pacific island civ at this point in the game, though they should really try to strike while the iron is hot here. If they make significant gains against the Bunuba, it could be a solid industrial base they’d need to avoid the usual South Pacific island civ fate.</p><p></p><p>In the sidebar, the Fuck France coalition may be coming to an end, as the Snoryaks be the bigger men and sue for peace.</p>"

  scene_title: "Liberté, Égalité, Éternité"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now a shot of Central Europe. It’s sad (perhaps pathetic is a more apt term) to see civs crippled quite like this - there are more former French-founded cities than current ones. And that ratio could be worsening, one day... if Illyria ever takes Paris below half health. </p><p></p><p>Teuta certainly has the upper hand here, and all the ranged unit firing points one could ask for, but just isn’t using them effectively. Maybe the AI isn’t up to this particular task - I reckon most human players could have taken Paris an age ago.</p><p></p><p>Henry V has certainly overcome this historical weakness of the British TSL, and established himself well on the European mainland. However, he’s going to have to get rid of his sentimentality and upgrade those longbowmen if he wants to compete long term.</p>"

  scene_title: "All those poor hippos!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Portugal has run right in and taken Hippo Regius, reducing Carthage to just the city of Utique. Is it worth the warmonger penalty to finish her off, Carlos? Dido certainly isn’t putting up much of a fight, with her only remaining unit a worker stationed inside the city.</p><p></p><p>Small amounts of damage coming against Lyon, perhaps from Lesotho, who have maneuvered four different ships into the Mediterranean to take pot shots at poor Jeanne d’Arc.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Out, damned spot!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Ngarrindjeri consolidate their homeland a little more, removing the blight of Siam’s small city of Chonburi. They’re wielding a decent-not-great army and navy, but have the frigate advantage that New Zealand lacks as of yet.</p><p></p><p>Interesting that no civs have claimed Uluru yet, as the AI tends to beeline settling near natural wonders. Perhaps the faith bonus means little to this area of the world that knows no gods and masters, yet to adopt a religion.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Eystein’s Norway seems to be in pretty good shape, a sharp divergence from the typical Royale that leaves the Scandinavians to squabble and die whimpering amongst themselves. Unlocking frigates would be a great help, as they seem to outclass Sweden in almost every military category besides naval ranged.</p><p></p><p>Sweden can rest easy knowing that the Timurids are no longer a threat to invade Stockholm. Norway, on the other hand...</p><p></p><p>In other news, that Yakutian settler looks poised to make Tyukanskoye a friend. Isn’t that a little far from your capital, Darkhan?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Pahlavis are just the next domino to fall in the worldwide scourge of Liberalism. That certainly won’t make them any friends in Communist Makhnovia, but that’s not an imminent threat - their army seems to be otherwise indisposed elsewhere. Speaking of armies, Pahlavi, where are you embarking that group of cannons and gatling guns to?</p><p></p><p>Yemen, who seems in the early-going to be a real contender in this game, has built the Statue of Liberty. Certainly by the population totals it seems they’ve been collecting huddled masses!</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Trouble on the Indian subcontinent as conflict WAR breaks out between Rashtrakuta and Bengal! Muhammad Khan seems like he should be the obvious favorite in this conflict, but it seems he left his army in the Northeast reaches of his empire. That could prove to be a little dangerous - even behind in tech, Mayurkhandi is mostly undefended at the moment and Rashtrakuta could make a play.</p><p></p><p>Unless those units move fast, or a real game-changer joins the war, it doesn’t seem like the end of the line for Amoghavarsha quite yet.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter11-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Is that a game-changer enough? No...I don’t really think so. Timur also declares war on Rashtrakuta, but would have to cross a handful of messy borders to have any serious impact on the war.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, though England has made a convincing breach into mainland Europe, Henry V has failed to consolidate the isles, leaving Scotland and part of Ireland open to Lesothan  and Yemeni settlements. </p><p></p><p>Good for King Tut, the brave soul to first settle Iceland. Does that put him in the line of fire of Deseret, the stewards of Greenland? Who had Egypt-Utah conflict on their BR bingo cards?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Heading down to Patagonia, we see a nearly-uninterrupted settlement from the Guaycuru, who have cleaned up nicely in South America - they hold about half of its landmass at the moment. But, there’s a little thorn in Eso’s side, as the Inca found Machu right in Tierra del Fuego. I wouldn’t be playing with fire if I were the Inca, as Guaycuru could roll over and end their existence.</p><p></p><p>In the sidebar, we see France swapping one foe for another - peace with Sweden allows for war with the Ket to break out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Heading to bordergore galore, central Russia, where Rouran has bravely declared war against the Ket. Well, maybe foolhardishly would be a more appropriate word. Unless there are some other coalition members besides faraway France, this could be a serious mistake for our bright yellow friends who are seriously outclassed in terms of military might (at least in the northern colonies) . Given Ket’s unwillingness to expand, this could be a few free cities on a silver platter.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Jimmu shoots his shot and declares war on Goguryeo! A shame that none of Japan’s military seems to be in position, or even with a great path towards Goguryean cities, since it looks like Sun Yat-Sen’s settler is poised to plop a frustrating little city across the river from modern-day Seoul.</p><p></p><p>On the bright side, that probably staves off Chinese invasion a little longer due to the war buddies diplo boost!</p>"

  narration: "<p>F</p><p></p><p>And with that, Carlos fulfills the great dream of the Roman Censor Cato, destroying Carthage once and for all. Carthage is officially eliminated in 51st place.</p><p></p><p>It’s tough to eulogize a civ that didn’t do much and didn’t amount to much... so I’ll just say that Qart Hadasht was probably a great place to live in its heyday.</p><p></p><p>The new province has been renamed Carlosthage. Citizens find it difficult to pronounce, and the Portuguese settlers don’t even have a sound for the “age” phoneme, but kings will do what kings will do.</p>"

You forgot to expand, or tech up, or really do much of anything besides be the only adopter of Judaism. But at least you’ve got something new going on!</p><p></p><p>The little sword icon is the Bek, Khazaria’s Great General replacement. It can be used to passively convert cities it’s stationed in, which would be helpful if Khazaria had participated in any wars and had to convert any cities, but this is not the case.</p>"

Now, it’ll be interesting to see where Teuta goes from here - grab another Mediterranean port in Lyon, or try their hand at central Europe in Debrecen?</p><p></p><p>Either way, it’s starting to be a risky bet. The tech weakness certainly must be obvious to Illyria’s neighbors, and production doesn’t seem to be replacing all of the lost units well.</p><p></p><p>Makhnovia has a really sparse border in that region - perhaps they know Illyria and France are no real threat, but perhaps they’re gearing up for something else...</p>"

Standing at #4 in the preliminary power rankings, I’m not sure three cities and a halfway decent military is grounds for applause.

With all razed tiles bar one farm up north and a single trebuchet to their name, Luba lives to fight another day! How much longer is yet to be determined.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Lesothan incursion into Maravi’s capital seems to be going well, if not going particularly fast. Doesn’t Moshoeshoe know cannons can’t shoot over mountains? Get that sucker into range!</p>"

Cannons and gatling guns are closing in on Amoghavarsha’s capital, but he has abandoned his palace, joining the merry minstrels heading south out of the city.</p><p></p><p>Again, with another high-pop capital! The Bengali city of Murshidabad, at pop 38, has an equivalent real-world population of 26,509,000. Dhaka ain’t too shabby, either.</p>"

It will almost certainly fall, unless Lesothans vote their way out of a capital capture like the Azande. But I suspect not too long from now, Kalonga Mazula will be fleeing to his accidental colony of Tamantarkha.</p><p></p><p>Yemen continues to display industrial prowess, completing...a wonder I am not familiar with, but hoping the showrunners can help me out with!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yakutia joins the Liberalism boys’ club, and is the eighth so far to do it in the episode! But holy moly, look at all those low-pop, yet somehow productive cities. Hopefully that production goes towards a military soon, since it looks like Mongolia is itching for a war to test out its toys on. Plus, getting a piece of Goguryeo doesn’t seem too bad a deal.</p><p></p><p>Strange for Makhnovia to declare war on Luba out of the blue, unless it means there’s a coalition building to finish them off for good this time?</p>"

In only a few parts, China has really amassed quite an impressive amount of productive and populous land. If they filled it all with units... euugh. It makes me shudder just to think of it.</p><p></p><p>We also see the introduction of the Tongmenghui, China’s UU and replacement for the Great War Infantry! This handy little unit is stronger the happier China is, so it’ll be important for Sun Yat-Sen to keep morale boosted. Maybe a little less conquest for the time being would do the trick.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Did you know that locusts and grasshoppers are actually the same species? It was thought for hundreds of years that the two were different, but it turns out that locusts are just grasshoppers that have undergone a chemical change. You see, grasshoppers are usually very antisocial, but when enough serotonin is released, they change coloration and begin swarming. And one way to release that serotonin? Brushing up against the back of each others’ legs, effectively tickling each other and making the swarm larger and larger!</p><p></p><p>Bengal must have gone into serotonin overdrive, because they’re swarming Rashtrakuta. Sthambadri is at half health, and Lattaluru has started to take damage.</p><p></p><p>Joining the Rashtrakuta campaign - perhaps a little too late - is Illyria. Not sure I’d want them on my team given how long it took them to walk into Paris.</p>"

Is it possible Lyon has flipped to have such a dramatic population loss (they were at 9 earlier this episode), or have people been starved out by the constant barrage? Either way, the city could be Illyrian not too long from now.</p><p></p><p>The same could be said of Debrecen, which has mounted a slightly better defense, but still finds itself in the yellow. Any way you see it, France has really cut the cheese on this one.</p>"

At this point in the game, it is no longer a real achievement to amass the same number of cities as an embarrassed France.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even more embarrassing, the open borders that war dictates allowed two Rouran settlers to pass directly under Kellog’s nose.

The necessary units to take it are without a doubt there - what’s the hold-up, China? Having happiness issues?</p><p></p><p>Hopefully not distracting too much production from the existential threat literally on the doorstep, Gwanggaeto has declared his intention to rid the world of Luba once and for all.</p><p></p><p>Maybe I don’t give Goguryeo enough credit.

But it seems that once again, Luba could be under threat - that is, only if Sierra Leone has open borders with Azembe. Seeing no units of either civ within the other’s borders, we can conclude that Luba rests (albeit uneasy) another night.</p><p></p><p>And, in the top right corner, we see Yemen sporting the first aircraft carrier of the game!

A big push from the Guaycuru means Lula’s former São Paulo has begun taking damage!</p><p></p><p>Nuevo Pilcomayo seems too far gone at this point for Eso to worry much about, but if he could make serious inroads against São Paulo and Brasília, that tune might change.</p><p></p><p>Look at the Marajoara... sitting there... not doing much...

Bengal still has both cities surrounded, so time will tell if al-Sulayhi can get her licks in, but they wouldn’t be the most filling morsels anyway. Attrition has knocked both Manyakheta’s and Lattaluru’s populations down to the low single digits.</p><p></p><p>Bengal sure does have a lot of gatling guns, and they aren’t the only ones!
