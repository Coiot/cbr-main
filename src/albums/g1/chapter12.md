  scene_title: "Sultana of Swings"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>On our first slide, we witness the new no.1 most wanted - Yemen. Contrary to their current irl position, Sultana Arwa has been dominating the ranks with her red sea fleet, her good production, well-strewn cities and high science and growth. Her army doesn’t seem to be too plentiful however, especially with the rebels pitting up here and there, and Egypt is breathing up at her with a pretty big carpet, so she has to stay wary. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>We’ve seen the woman of the hour, now lets witness the man of the hour! Bengal has been rising through the ranks recently with timely invasion of Rashkakurta (Ayy first try!). They seem to have signed peace despite having them on the ropes, and their army seems sparse, but nevertheless they have sizable cities and solid stats </p>"

  scene_title: "Wilting Flower"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>We move on to Mexico where we find the living corpse of the Mixtecs. They have their Great General replacement, the Chauana Chii, and a decent carpet of crossbows, but lets be real here - Texas, the Shoshone and the UFC would probably crush them in a few turns if not for the mountains. Speaking of Texas, they got a force around Corpus Christi…</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uhh looks like I got things wrong with the Bengal-Rashtrakuta war! They are still at war, and Bengal is still besieging the entirety of the Tamil minor power with extreme prejudice! Amonghavarshta must be malding right now. Even the gods can’t go in his favour with their narration. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Down in the Caucasus mountains, Bulan of the Khazars is sitting still in his yurt. He had just gotten the news. The Pahlavis have called off their invasion, and they had given their offerings to YHWH. He grunts in his chair. There really isn’t much left for him or his people in this desolate plot one can barely call a city. His peoples old lands have been tossed around for generations, first taken by the “Anarchists”, then by the Timmurids. He sighs. Home is where the heart is, and he should be thankful that he even has a home. Many are not as lucky. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Debrecen is being boltened by the Illyrians, and they have more than enough troops to conquer the city and take 33% of the French’s land! Joan of Arc tries to rally the local troops under the name of God, but all they say on the walls is “We Surrender!” </p>"

  scene_title: "Sacre Bleu!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Debrecen has been predictably captured by the Illyrians. They probably have the units to try for Lyon or Orleans but it's probably not worth the effort and not enough to make it worth. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene11.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene14.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene16.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems that the Deseret city of West Jordan has committed one too many acts of debauchery, because they defected to the Yakuts and God is punishing this defection with immolation! All several million people in the city are to be roasted by the Yakut horsemen of death, and though this may hurt Young in the short term, it really shouldn’t matter in the big game in exchange for cleanliness of the soul. </p>"
- scene_number: 19

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>The dual hordes of Mongolia and Rouran decide to duke it out! They have roughly even amounts of power on the front, so it should go nowhere. The ritual sacrifice should please the blood gods though. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a slightly more relevant war, Tutakhamen has decided to gun after Ur! Though the front is sparse, it should fill up enough for him to take the city. </p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Ok this actually makes sense"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Liberals have been dominating the cylinder, and Portugal is the latest to adopt the ideology! It actually makes sense though, given Carvalhos position as a prime minister irl and the Portuguese penchant for trade</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here lieth the Maravi, sent to a grave by Lesotho. They tried to push a bit early on but just never expanded enough. I’m not sure if they’re dead btw. Consider this a premature funeral. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene23.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Illyrian warbands of musketmen are marching over Lyon! This may be a bit precarious, but nothing to worry about too much. Then again, this is France we're talking about. Oh, and to add insult to injury, the Portuguese are invading! This means that either way Lyon is lost.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kalonga Mazula awakens in an unfamiliar town. The place he had called home for centuries, nay, millenia, had been conquered by Lesotho not long before. To some degree, this place feels just a tiny bit like home, with its hills and drylands. However, all the forests were fir, and the people spoke in tongues he could not parse. His trusted advisor stood behind him. “My lord, welcome to Tamartakana.” Meanwhile, Bulan gives a dry, sobbed chuckle from Balanjar.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene27.jpg

  scene_title: "Jungle Retribution"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a flyover to the Guaycuru-Omagua war. These two stalwart powers have been juking it out for centuries, the terrain preventing heavy progress. In this slide, we can see the Guaycuru are poised to retake their lost city of Nuevo Pilcomayo. </p>"

  scene_title: "Si Senor"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>And the Guaycuru take it! There are few troops nearby to defend, and Brazil will probably prevent much reinforcement, but on the flipside the Omagua looked gassed so </p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Knaarrrrrrrrrrr"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Knaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. This Great Admiral would probably be more useful early game since when expended to boost production, all your settlers can go overseas. But alas, here he lies, in the admittedly pretty strong Norwegian empire. They are keeping with the times in terms of tech and can gulp Sweden any time of the day. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>We peek at western Australia. The utter failure of the Bunuba to settle the vast stretches have resulted in the great Bengal colony and the New Zealand convict colony of Christchurch, strewing the sands with spice and misery respectively. Speaking of the Bunuba, the Ngarrindjeri have begun to besiege the capital of Junjuwa. It should be a matter of time now.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "The Convergence of Three Armies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>We move back to the great northern steppe, where the Rouran city of Xihai is under siege by a joint Mongol-Chinese force. A group of intrepid crossbows have tried to siege Chongqing to no effect. The Rouran are utterly outclassed by the Chinese, so this should be a quick one</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Not you too Logan!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the city of Logan, a little boy named Logan decided to take candy from the child of a Yakut diplomat. This is enough for the Yakutians to take control of the city in a bloodless coup and to set the town ablaze thinking that the city has wronged them. Congrats Logan. You just slaughtered millions of people.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Trouble in the Tundra"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of the Yakuts, their core seems a bit empty right about now. There are some rebel riflemen, showing discontentment with the current government, and the troops while up to date aren’t plentiful nor good for offense. Those happiness issues must be fixed soon or else. Speaking of which, rejoice, we’ve entered a golden age!</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "France is Washington"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene36.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene37.jpg

- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Everythings freer in Texas"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>Texas just owned themselves by adopting Liberalism. Actually, no, they just decided to go true to their core values of property and freedom. Once again, makes sense.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Nuevo no more"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene39.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ok so these notes mentioned that Yemen is a great power, and you can see why. Good tech, good production, and a good position to invade India to go further beyond. Speaking of India, we witness the sad shell of the Rashtrakuta and battalions of the Bengal swarming the south to prepare for expansion.</p>"

  scene_title: "At the edge of the earth"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>At the very edge of the earth, layeth the second Mongol frontier. A strange happenstance of events have resulted in the Mongolians gaining a second core on the shores of the Bering strait, bordering the Yakuts wide open. These Eastern Mongols should always stay wary of their local opponents, but for now they thrive. Also, take note of that Chinese settler.</p>"
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: "How hard could it be?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Bunuba capital is literally at no health, but there are no melee units that can take it aside from a Kiwi trireme. It really should not be that hard to move a rifleman up there and take it, but AI gotta AI. </p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Choc-naw"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a look at the tragic state of the Choctaw. A one city empire, cut in two by Shoshone and New French citadels, at the mercy of the aforementioned powers. Poor Pushmanta can’t get a break. </p>"

  scene_title: "C’mon get more creative"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene44.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Heavens Christ this might be the first time I ever see an empire start to crumble due to internal strife. Ogden just revolted to the Yakuts, and along with it a litany of Great War Infantry! Deseret is really taking a massive L down here with their happiness.</p>"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: "Should’ve brought the rifles man"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kiwis capture the Bunuba capital of Junjuwa under the noses of the Ngarrindjeri! The commanders of the nation are baffled that it could’ve even happened. Decades of conquest only to get taken by someone else. When asked whether the lack of rifles mattered, they simply dismissed the notion of their cannons and gatling guns being unable to capture the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 47
  scene_title: "Is this really a good move?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>Makhnovia has decided to attack those accursed authoritarians in Kazakhstan to fund a peoples revolution! However, no troops are anywhere near the Kazakh border, so it may be possible that Makhnov just gave two free cities to the Kazakhs.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Ngarrindjeri, seeing no reason to keep fighting after being stolen off a city, peace out with the Bunuba. The Kiwis and Bengals still exist, but they should be less dangerous.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene51.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Rouran military rally their might to protect Xihai from the Sino-Mongol invaders! Though they are awfully outteched by the Chinese, they can still endeavour to use the hills to hold the line. Nevertheless, Xinhai is in the yellow. </p>"
- scene_number: 52
  scene_title: "Ur Boutta Die"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene52.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well it looks like Tut decided not to move any troops against Ur. Pahlavi seems elated at this opportunity, as he launches another invasion of the land! This should probably go better.</p>"

  scene_title: "Letsgotho"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene53.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho is shown chilling in this slide. They have a decent empire, and that army could be a bit bigger but I know most of it is up north. Also we get a look at the Azande Skeleton Coast and the Sierra Leone outpost of Kenema. And the Azande have planes.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ur really screwed now"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene55.jpg

  scene_title: "Funneling funds"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene56.jpg
  narration: "<p>“Sign this contract”</p><p>The stalwart lord of the Rouran, Yuljulu, eyed it despairingly. He did not like the new ways these foreigners promoted one bit, the so called “liberal” ideology. But he has no choice. If Xinhai was to hold, he’ll need their funds. </p><p>“Thank you for your cooperation.” </p>"

  scene_title: "Epic Liberal Fail Moment"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene58.jpg
  narration: "<p>Welp looks like the foreign support failed to save Xinhai. As if to rub salt on the wound, the Chinese make sure they can never recover the city with a great fire. Yuljulu must not be happy.</p>"
- scene_number: 59
  scene_title: "Not even trying"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene59.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite not a single unit being anywhere near the Mixtec lands, the Texans have taken Tilantongo to the deep red. Man, the Mixtecs are such a fun civ. Too bad Six Deer has a monkey brain. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene60.jpg
  narration: "<p>To round out the part, we return to the Iranian invasion of Ur, with the progress being… non existent. Is this really a new slide? How the hell do you make that little progress?

  scene_title: "Bottom of the Barrel"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter12-scene62.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the other hand, the Choctaw, Shu, Khazars, Srivijaya and Swedes make the bottom of thee list. Interestingly, Shu Han has a higher rank than all 4 powers below them despite being two eras behind in tech. Speaking of that last power, Ur is probably dead next part. So, anyways, thank you for watching the show, and till next time!</p>"
