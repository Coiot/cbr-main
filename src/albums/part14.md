  narration: |-
    Greetings, mates and matesses, welcome to the r/civ 60+ civ Battle Royale Mk2. Part 14! We‘ve got some very exciting stuff happening here tonight, and it is an honour for me, /u/Burgerkrieg , to be narrating this. I will also narrate it later. Don‘t know what I‘m talking about? Think I‘m having a seizure? Well, I‘m the bloke who takes the slideshows, reads them all and then puts that on YouTube so all the lazies who don‘t want to read don‘t have to. Aren‘t I a splendid guy? Anyway, I finally got to actually writing one of these, so I can make myself say anything, ANYTHING! So yeah, I may go a little mad on power occasionally, because who can control what he says, really?
    If you haven‘t been there yet (in which case: what is wrong with you?), go take a peek at r/civbattleroyale, where you‘ll really be at the centre of the action surrounding this Battle Royale. Fan made content of all shapes and sizes, our own brand of countryballs comics, trash talk and shameless slander, dick pics, and much, much, much more. Join this awesome community today!
    And now, strap in.

  narration: Another one of those magnificent maps made by /u/SylonL , which you should
    very much open in full definition to catch all the details. Cities added by /u/LaxiscalAraisical
    and city flips by /u/thehonestyfish

  narration: It would appear as though the Ottomans, out of spite for not being part
    of the game, contract their admirals out to the highest bidder, with Hayreddin
    Barbarossa now working for the Inuit, who are definitely the kings of the Bering
    Strait. It would also appear as though the Blackfoot are looking to start their
    own chain of shellfish restaurants, Blue Lobster, as they pull tons and tons of
    crabs out of the water on their small island chain.

  narration: While the Siege of Hoa Lu is only making slow progress, Tibet launches
    a proper invasion of China. If they manage to grab both it and Shanghai, we might
    see the comeback of a nation we thought had been relegated to turtle limbo. Meanwhile,
    Sri Lanka is making friends with the Fins and the Burmese. Perhaps this alliance
    will lead to great things in the future? And over in the Americas, the White Walkers
    decide that it‘s time to cool down the hot-blooded Texans.

  narration: Not that the DOW really matters, as Houston shares no borders with Ekeuhnick.
    Instead, he focuses on securing his hold on the cream cheese capital of the universe
    and exchanging notes with Sitting Bull as how one successfully survives being
    at war with almost all of your neighbours.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: Image 06

  narration: Speaking of DOW that don‘t really matter, the Timurids have had enough
    of being spied on in the shower by the filthy Jewish scouts. He also very effectively
    counters the Scourge of God from taking his shit, which only further helps to
    embarrass the man. What gives, Attila? You were supposed to sweep over Siberia,
    burn all of it down and replace it with city names that follow absolutely no coherent
    logic. Instead you‘re just angrily striking at whatever is in your reach.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07

  narration: 'Aaaaaand in today‘s instalment of “I did not see that coming”: China
    snipes Hoa Lu with a lone horseman right from under the Tibetans. It‘s doubtful
    that they‘ll hold it for long, however, as the entire region is swarming with
    foes. Still, well played Mao, well bloody played.'
- scene_number: '08'

  narration: War should be going a lot better for Vietnam in the south, where they
    have an impressive fleet. They are about to retake Vigan from the clutches of
    the Japanese, who not only have an Ottoman Admiral of their own on their payroll,
    but also seem to have enlisted the help of some Korean ships to make up for the
    fact that their fleet is nowhere near the Trung Sisters‘ In terms of size and
    technological development.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene09.jpg
  narration: Despite all involved parties sitting practically on top of each other,
    the war between the three -lands is limited to a few admittedly brutal skirmishes.
    On land, English bowmen are getting battered from afar, while their impressive
    fleet looks like it could actually make a good run for Derry. Mainly though, the
    English and the Irish are shouting at each other in overcrowded pubs, while the
    Icelanders look on from their table in the Irish corner. What‘s much more interesting
    is the small fleet of powerful galleasses the Nazis seem to have been churning
    out these last few turns. True to the German stereotype of preferring quality
    over quantity, these folks could actually do some serious damage in these waters,
    which are almost exclusively inhabited by Triremes.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene10.jpg
  narration: As David and Saladin kiss and make up (no homo), the Ayyubids defend
    Gondar against both Congolese and Ethiopian aggressors. There‘s a steady stream
    of reinforcements coming in, so this city capture might take a while. Meanwhile,
    Kruger has amassed enough workers around Klerksdorp to start a Marxist revolution,
    and a lone Zulu warrior has somehow gotten a front seat to an actual real conflict,
    so that he may learn how to go about this whole “war” thing and teach his people
    about it.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene11.jpg
  narration: Forget what I said about Attila, he seems to have once again found his
    calling as he takes Chimgi-Tura and immediately puts it to the torch. He is, however,
    facing a dire situation in his own back yard, where the Top Keks start their (admittedly
    a little poorly planned) assault on his court. Finland, who everyone thought would
    get eaten alive by its neighbours, now has a real shot at cutting the head off
    one of the scariest civilizations in this game. Next thing you know, Yakutia actually
    does something interesting.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene12.jpg
  narration: North of Hudson Bay, Blackfoot, Inuit, Sioux and Canadians alike try
    to etch out a living between snowy land and icy waters. This, of course, is accompanied
    by the constant drum fire of fierce-looking galleasses blowing away the goddamn
    snowman they just rebuilt for the THIRD BLOODY TIME! Jesus Christ you people!
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene13.jpg
  narration: 'Vigan is back under Vietnamese rule, and it looks very unlikely that
    Meiji will get it back any time soon. He has, however, successfully devalued a
    city belonging to Asia‘s current front runner (by a narrow margin). The Korean
    mercenaries decide that Japan isn‘t really worth dying for after all, and go back
    to playing Starcraft: Brood War, because 2 isn‘t out yet in 1560 BC.'
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene14.jpg
  narration: Seeing as the Yakuts are fundamentally boring, let‘s talk about the fact
    that some hillbilly engineer apparently stumbled upon the technology required
    to propel Texas into the ree-nay-saunce. The Texans are constantly working on
    new ways to “send dem goddaym northerners back to dey land”, except if they‘re
    Sioux, in which case it‘s OK. Same goes for “goddaym Yankees”, “goddaym frenchies”
    and “goddaym mexicanos”.
- scene_number: "15"

  narration: Benito Juarez seems to have given up completely on carving himself a
    slice of that sweet pecan-and-bacon pie, mainly because the pie appears to be
    made out of cinder blocks and he‘s cutting with the dull edge of his knife. His
    Army doesn‘t look as impressive as it once did either.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene16.jpg
  narration: With that Buccaneer fleet, it is unlikely that Argentina will be able
    to hold onto Paraná for too long. However, Henry Morgan will have to divert some
    forces to prevent those Brazilian party boats from taking Nevis off of him. Also
    note that the workers south of Paraná seem to have been pretty drunk when building
    those roads.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene17.jpg
  narration: In the Mediterranean, Nicomedia is still very far in the red, but appears
    to be recovering. I‘m not sure how long though, as Leonidas already plans tom
    hit him with the next DOW. The much more interesting thing happening in this shot
    is Rome‘s visible plunge into decadence. Seeing as they‘ve pretty much lost the
    BR at this point, the Romans have decided to go out in a blaze of booze, sex,
    and hallucinogenic substances.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene18.jpg
  narration: To the south, Hannibal makes peace with the Moroccans, so that he can
    clear a little time out of his schedule to prepare and consume a delicious liver,
    onion and carrot stew with big chunks of meat from the chops and white pepper,
    served on a bed of steamed basmati rice with a side of gammon roses garnished
    with parsley, some fava beans, and a glass of chianti. He does this on his terrace
    in Carthago Nova, from where he can see the goings on of the fight between the
    Kongo and Mali in Kongo Dia Nlaza.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene19.jpg
  narration: Not saying that Darius could just go for it and take a crack at Jerusalem
    now that he has his units so perfectly positioned around it, but he totally could.
    David is way too busy filing the latest mail into the “DOW‘s from Leonidas” filing
    cabinet, the accommodation of which required a recent expansion of his already
    impressive palace.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene20.jpg
  narration: With his Korean allies threatening to leave, Meiji decides to construct
    some additional pylons and takes the war for Vigan into his own hands. Not that
    it looks god for him, as the city is surrounded by bowmen and an endless stream
    of triremes is coming from the south.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene21.jpg
  narration: Now that the Ottomans started the trend, Spain also decides to send some
    of it‘s own personnel to do some mercenary work in the form of Alvaro de Bazán,
    who I totally did not have to Google. Neither the Kimberley nor the Aussies seem
    particularly concerned about each other when it comes to border security. I do
    wonder what those Maori are doing running around the Outback like that.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene22.jpg
  narration: Morgan successfully drives off Pedro‘s boats and sets up a massive blockade
    around Paraná, which now seems doomed to fall into the hands of the swashbuckling
    scallywags. Leonidas‘ constant temper tantrums make the news the world over, leading
    even Mao to decide he‘s had enough of this bullshit and gives him a stern talking
    to.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene23.jpg
  narration: Smoke on the water can be seen in the southernmost Philippine cities,
    from which one can see the looming carpet of Digeridoom in almost uncanny high
    definition. Looking at this, one cannot help but see that the Indonesians have
    been busy building a navy that would be considered grandiose in most other parts
    of the world. Similar things go for the Cham, though theirs seems a little lacking
    in the galleass department.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene24.jpg
  narration: Down in south South America, a variety of warships is giving a variety
    of differently coloured warships the middle finger, but not much else. Meanwhile,
    those additional pylons actually paid off for Japan, who have, against all odds,
    managed to recapture Vigan.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene25.jpg
  narration: In other parts of the continent, one can witness even more middle fingers.
    Onlooking Hawaiians are confused and wonder if the natives of this continent don‘t
    know how to use warships, despite having built many of them.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene26.jpg
  narration: Sam Houston decides that scouts will be best suited to support Sitting
    Bull in his war effort against the Canadians, because they literally carry big
    sticks. Further in the core of his Empire, Pearson has got some shiny longswordmen
    waiting to dirty their shiny armour with casino money when they finally arrive
    to take on the Sioux.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene27.jpg
  narration: Meiji seems to understand that the best place to preach your religion
    is shellfish restaurants, as he sends an army of missionaries and even a prophet
    over to North America. Looks like the catholic are finally going to get some competition
    up there.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene28.jpg
  narration: Here come the Turtle Ships, and not a small amount of them. Designed
    specifically for no-holes-barred lan-parties on the high seas, Korea will annihilate
    its enemies by the sheer speed of their clicks. It will take of while for them
    to reach any theatre of war, however, even though the sea up here doesn‘t look
    as clogged up as certain other parts of Asia.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene29.jpg
  narration: You know, TPang, it‘s actually getting pretty late for me here, and every
    time you show me a slide of Yakutia there‘s a good to fair chance that I‘ll fall
    asleep on my keyboard.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene30.jpg
  narration: Jose Rizal decides he‘s had enough of war and promptly makes peace with
    both Japan and the Kimberley. If rumours are true, this new era of peace was celebrated
    with a huge karaoke party in Manila, where Rizal himself gave a great rendition
    of Led Zeppelin‘s “Moby Dick”. Also, expect Vigan to turn green again any moment
    now.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene31.jpg
  narration: As St. George‘s channel fills up with the blood of dead seamen (green
    and red blood respectively), we come to the slow realization that this was going
    to be a war of attrition from the very start and we shouldn‘t be disappointed
    that nothing interesting has happened yet. It‘ll happen. Or not.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene32.jpg
  narration: Leonidas, spitting as he shouts commands in a rabieslike battle rage,
    tries to besiege both Ravenna and Rome at the same time, with varying success.
    Meanwhile, the entire eastern half of his empire is almost entirely devoid of
    military personnel. If one were, for instance, Byzantium, or maybe Poland, and
    one were so inclined, one could possibly maybe take several cities off the Spartans
    as though it were a cake walk. This is your chance! Take the madman down before
    he becomes unstoppable!
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene33.jpg
  narration: Vast steppes once green with fields and filled with men willing to die
    for their countries are now nought but smoking pyres and groups of weary soldiers
    fighting not for ideals, because it‘s the only thing they have ever known. I think
    we should all take a moment to step back and contemplate what we are actually
    doing. We laugh when one leader shames another, we clap when peasants who have
    been given weapons slaughter each other for pointless conflict, and we cheer at
    the genocide of hundreds of thousands because we find it entertaining. We are
    horrible people.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene34.jpg
  narration: Moving on, Kongo Dia Nlaza has been taken by Mali, hilariously putting
    hundreds of people to the sword. It does not look as though the Kongo has any
    chance at recapturing the city, though it does provide a fantastically weakened
    target for an opportunistic cannibal who has seen it all go down...
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene35.jpg
  narration: While Tiridates and Saladin refriend each other on Facebook, the southern
    half of Africa is almost as boring as Yakutia, only here there is actually the
    chance that something might happen. Kruger doesn‘t seem as concerned with the
    Impi casually walking by his border and making conversation with his way too chill
    workers. Though maybe there‘s good reason for that, as the Zulu are still using
    bows now regarded curiosities fit for museums in most of the world.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene36.jpg
  narration: It seems to me like almost all of the civs who have been at war for these
    past few instalments are having their armies slowly reduced by the ever-grinding
    machine of death that is armed conflict. Meanwhile, Byzantium is fit and ready
    to take on the world, though it is doubtful that they‘ll be very successful at
    it, seeing as they would compliment a Zulu bowmaker on his craftsmanship without
    a hint of sarcasm.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene37.jpg
  narration: Looking at this slide makes me think Henry Morgan has made some big dum-dum,
    as Paraná is still under Argentinian control and his fleet is actually being legitimately
    challenged by the Brazilians. However, the city still looks doomed, as now actual
    land troops are helping out the situation.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene38.jpg
  narration: 'I‘ll be entirely honest here: I have no idea what the Hawaiian unique
    is, but it looks to me like they are probably wielding sex-toys that took the
    whole “little things for extra pleasure” idea a little too far. What? They are
    longswordmen that are more expensive than usual but require no iron and come with
    built in amphibious promotions? I like my sex-toy theory better, thank you very
    much.'
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene39.jpg
  narration: Taking a look at the beautiful and peaceful Blackfoot-Inuit border, I
    see a scout near a city I‘m scared to even type, let alone pronounce, with a colour
    scheme I do not recognize. Is he Indian? Will nuclear Gandhi make a surprise appearance
    in this series? Is he the John Cena of the Battle Royale?
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene40.jpg
  narration: 'Paraná flips, and the chances of Eva Peron taking it back are, let‘s
    be careful and say “unlikely”. Henry Morgan is still taking shit from and giving
    shit to Pedro, but at least Nevis is safe. Also, in case you‘re like me and missed
    it: the Maori declared war on the Huns a while back, because reasons, probably.'
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene41.jpg
  narration: Greenland looks like north-western Australia, if north-western Australia
    was a freezing white hellhole instead of a scorching red hellhole, what with all
    the mining towns and everything. It also looks like Iceland has the biggest military
    in this particular part of the world, though they probably have little interest
    in cities like Sheerbrooke or Kiyaksa, seeing as they‘re just as inhospitable
    as what they already have. Note that Nattfaravik has a population of 11, which,
    in these latitudes, can probably only be achieved by extremely efficient recycling
    of food, and not the kind where you put plastic and everything else in different
    bins. Same goes for Reydarfjall, which has even gone up to 13 pop.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene42.jpg
  narration: Hoa Lu is being steamrolled by the Yak Pack, which are taking way longer
    than I would have expected to take it back. To the east, Sejong is embarking his
    army on a little field trip to whoever will totally voluntarily give up their
    lands to them.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene43.jpg
  narration: Just seeing the northern border of Yakutia genuinely caused me to get
    a tight 8 hours. If boring everyone drowsy is their strategy for victory, I think
    we can all go home and accept that they‘ll be the winners of this competition.
    In other news, a German scout is getting more and more uncomfortable as he is
    surrounded by Mongolian composite archers.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene44.jpg
  narration: Conflict has returned to Itazipcho, and the Canadians and Inuit are making
    a combined effort to snatch the city back from Sitting Bull, who has a strobe
    light installed in his office indicating if he is currently owning the place or
    not. This could become a problem if he ever employs an epileptic secretary.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene45.jpg
  narration: Buddhism slowly makes its way to Atheiststralia, making it so far as
    to converting Geelong. It wont be too long now until people start reincarnating
    on the mainland, though I do suspect one could only either incarnate into am rock
    or a deadly giant death spider of deadly death Down Under.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene46.jpg
  narration: Bethlehem is being absolutely hammered by the Persians, who are pretty
    far away from their homeland. Saladin decides that it is best defended by a worker,
    who is probably rebuilding walls as quickly as Darius‘ composite archers are tearing
    it down. I guess he doesn‘t have enough fuel units to buy some angry people with
    scary weapons to defend the city. Should‘ve gone to Tai Lopez‘ website.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part14-scene47.jpg
  narration: We don‘t want to give too much shit to the Ayyubids though, seeing as
    Napoleon has decided the best investment of his fuel units into city defence is
    a warrior. Somewhere else entirely, Ahmad Al-Manslaughter is making the best out
    of Portugal‘s bad (or stupid) situation by taking Braga off the Congolese, which
    would grant him absolute control over the Strait of Gibraltar. Also, with the
    Spartans knocking on their door, the party in Rome continues, with Caesar inserting
    his penis into the mouth of a dead pig. Again.
- scene_number: "48"

  narration: Apparently Henry Parkes wants to open up his own shellfish restaurant
    chain by exploiting the fishing grounds around Easter Island, though Green Lobster
    will go for a more mysterious theme than the Shinto/ice road truckers themed Blue
    Lobster, mainly going for a “who the hell put those Moai there”-décor.

  narration: Actual fighting is beginning to take place around Tiwanaku, with Chile
    still holding back most of its navy for reasons we may never understand. Still,
    O‘Higgins‘ galleasses make short work of Pachacuti‘s antiquated triremes.
- scene_number: "50"

  narration: Miraculously, Meiji secures a proper hold on Vigan, proving once more
    that animal products are required if you‘re going to sustain yourself and not
    change colours all the time. Looking at the situation though, I wouldn‘t be surprised
    if the Trung Sisters ended up managing to snatch the city back from under him,
    proving once again that meat and dairy makes you fat and clogs up your brain.

  narration: He‘s not even finished in Rome and Ravenna, and Leonidas is already planning
    to take on Casimir, who could easily steal away some unguarded cities while the
    Spartan army is busy crashing Caesar‘s last orgy.

  narration: Once again, Attila is not in his best form, as the Sibir batter against
    the walls of Viroconium. There is some proper defence going on and reinforcements
    are on their way for both sides, so the battle could still go either way, but
    I‘m sure we‘ll see a lot of flipping in this city for the foreseeable future.

  narration: After feeling forced to take a short nap, I return to inform you that
    Tygyn Darkhan has completed another wonder that suggest he has no interest in
    becoming any less boring in the foreseeable future. Sure, a 15% bonus when fighting
    in friendly territory is not bad, but how is that going to help you down in Mongolia?

  narration: Leaving the sinking ship of china early on, Shi Lang decides to do some
    mercenary work of his own by siding with the English in the frankly a little stale
    war for the British isles. Maybe he‘ll bring some fresh wind into this conflict.
    Had the Potato Famine been around, I would have expected him to join the Irish,
    as their cuisine might be a little more attuned to his own taste.

  narration: 'Braga is now officially under Moroccan control, and Ahmad Al-Mansur
    decides to immediately erect a statue to Maria. Its inscription: In honour of
    the greatest idiot this world has seen yet, we will forever be grateful to your
    utter incompetence. Also, it seems the Texans are beginning to find it difficult
    of which injuns are good and which injuns are bad, so they just denounce the Sioux
    like they would any other redskin. And here I was, rooting for the tomahawk-wielding
    hillbilly fighting side-by-side with a shotgun-toting Strong Heart, ironic as
    that may be.'

  narration: A Mamluk is leading the charge on the Ethiopian city of Harar, which
    is breaking fast. I don‘t know how many cities these two civs have, but this conquest
    may very well be the tipping point that triggers Selassie‘s UA against Saladin,
    making all of his units considerably stronger.

  narration: A look at Sri Lanka, which fields a nice army and a slightly outdated
    navy. This civ could still be a bit of a wild card when it comes to turning the
    tide somewhere. Also, it seems TPang would like me to draw attention to the fact
    that the Mughals, the civ you had forgotten about, is also in this game, doing
    nothing particularly gripping or extraordinary. Somewhere else, the wild horse
    lords of Siberia and the disciplined Shaolin monks shake hands and declare the
    beginning of a new era of collaboration. Good on them.

  narration: 'Turns out Saladin does in fact have enough fuel units to bankroll a
    city defence or two, though by far not as much as our resident King of the Carnival,
    who seems to spend most of his time bouncing coins off of the voluptuous rears
    of his entourage of beautiful Brazilian ladies. 57: On the other end of the spectrum,
    the Maori, The Philippines and (somewhat racist-ironically) the Jews should take
    a look at some TedX talks about Warren Buffet. The fact that Caesar has filled
    up his jacuzzi with Johnnie Walker Blue label is making itself known in his treasure,
    but what the hell, you only die once, right?'

  narration: I feel like this is the exact same shot of Hawaii as a few slides ago.
    Absolutely nothing has changed, except for the fact that Orange Lobster, the restaurant
    chain that sells shellfish with the pearls still in it, is in the media for being
    a fraud, as it turns out oysters, clams and cockles aren‘t crustaceans at all,
    but in fact molluscs.

    Casimir called them smelly once.

  narration: A look at all of the reformation beliefs, in which we can see that Shinto
    definitely has the most useful one. Islam is seeking to eradicate the infidels‘
    beliefs more efficiently in the name of the Party Pope, and the Catholics are
    apparently very much interested in some extra soldiers. Also, it seems as though
    the Jews, in addition to lifting that ridiculous ban of delicious lobsters, is
    highly interested in getting their hands on some great people.

  narration: 'Bethlehem becomes Persian, and Darius has the army to back it up. This
    is some impressive stuff he pulled right there, making a conquest like away from
    his homeland and laying down the law. We‘ll see if this acquisition lasts. Also
    happening: Genghis finds that Attila has become a nuisance and must be dangled
    from his feet off the walls of his court.'

  narration: Some minor fighting is going on between Sweden and Poland in the Baltic
    Sea, though none of it too interesting. It‘s just one of those wars where nobody
    really pays attention and where nothing really changes except some pleb families
    having their livelihoods destroyed, and frankly, who cares about that, right?

  narration: In another interesting move, hillbilly land decides it wants to walk
    the path with “good, ‘murican folk”. Sitting Bull is a little pissed at this most
    recent betrayal, but he‘ll manage. After all, he‘s always been alone in this world
    anyway, and nobody really knows his pain.

  narration: This shot illustrates that, If the Boers decided to swallow the Zulus
    whole, they probably could. Even though they haven‘t done anything extraordinary
    yet, we must not forget that we are dealing with a passive giant here, and, other
    than bloody Yakutia, they actually strike out from time to time.

  narration: FIRST BLOOD! Leonidas captures Rome and finds Caesar in his palace, which
    is in ruins from the sheer explosiveness of the final orgy of decadence. Bursting
    into the pa;ace Leonidas cuts off Caesar‘s head and has it taxidermied and placed
    in the first of 60 alcoves in his “Gallery of Leaders I have killed”, located
    right above “Banners of Capitals I Control”, which has three pieces in it now,
    namely Constantinople, Rome and of course Sparta itself.

  narration: Shi Lang‘s good friend Zheng He, who was the one to first convince him
    to leave China, has apparently signed up with the Spartans in order to help Leonidas
    complete his head gallery. Varna is not in optimal shape, but it seems the attacks
    on it have died down completely, giving it some time to recover.

  narration: The last loyalists of Caesar, a legion and a Ballista, both in good condition,
    have fled Spartan lands with amazing speed and establish themselves in and around
    an old Citadel between Tigranocerta and Constantinople. Determined and angry,
    they do not believe the rumours of how their great leader died and have sworn
    to take over the world for him. We‘ll see how that goes. In other news, Armenia
    and Persia join forces to fight the Scourge of god.

  narration: |-
    The non-war between Arabia and the Congo ends, and the fight for Harar continues in Africa. Are there any other Battlestar Galactica fans up in this who smirk every time they see the Ethiopian city of Adama?

  narration: The British Isles War continues to be uneventful but still somewhat interesting,
    as an attack on Nottingham seems to have been stopped. The Nazi 1337Fleet hasn‘t
    suffered a single loss in whatever it‘s doing right now, and generally, I can‘t
    help but be impressed with how secure and technologically advanced Germany looks
    right now. It would appear as though, when it comes to defending his country,
    Hitler did nothing wrong.

  narration: With Vigan once again becoming ripe for capture, it‘s good that the Trung
    Sisters have opted for peace with Israel. Maybe now they can take all of the resources
    they wasted on that war and use it to mount a proper defence of Vigan this time
    around. Same goes for the war with the Kimberley.

  narration: As Leonidas returns home with his troops, leaving only a token force
    behind to defend his new war trophy, Maria sees her chance for a smash-and-grab
    with some navy and archers around Funchal. Assisting her in this are the Ethiopians,
    though I doubt they‘ll do anything more than provide some moral support. The Spartan
    leader is already rubbing his hands for some new additions to the gallery, though
    he has other plans right now. He orders his artisans to finish the plaque for
    “Sultan Harun al-Rashid, Weaponizer of Lawsuits” a little more quickly, as he
    can already see that particular alcove occupied.

    going if he wants to continue being an efficient warmonger.'

  narration: When it comes to cities, the Inuit are also on top of the game, with
    a whopping 29, closely followed by the Boers and Australians, who seem to be home
    in pretty much all of the Top 3s. The Buccaneers make for a nice addition to the
    top 10, coming in eve before the Yakuts.

  narration: I refuse to believe that scientists are boring, but it is as though Yakutia
    was desperately trying to prove me wrong. The Australian civs are also pretty
    advanced, and Korea really is shooting through the ranks now, as their AU is really
    starting to kick in. We may see them becoming a very dangerous foe yet.

  narration: "Despite it‘s daring capture of Bethlehem, Persia seems a little low
    on soldiers, and Rome is the first civ to dip below the Babylon limit. \nThat‘s
    all from me, and I have to say it was a great honour to get to narrate the first
    actual edition in which somebody actually got annihilated. That‘s better than
    any number of Lamborghinis in my Lamborghini account. If you want to keep up to
    date with the Battle Royale but don‘t want the hassle of reading through every
    slideshow, I highly recommend you subscribe to my YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC72cc_8atEmmO0l2BwBs9nA/videos
    ), where I narrate all of these about a day after they come out for everyone,
    so you can see them pop up on your subscription feed and add them to the “watch
    later” playlist, because let‘s be real for a moment here: you don‘t actually ever
    look at that playlist. I run the channel with my mate Kharaz, who is an actual
    real amateur pro-gamer and has been to tournaments, and we‘ll be putting out some
    more different content soon.\nUntil then, special thanks to based TPangolin, so
    long, and thanks for all the fish. Burgerkrieg out."
