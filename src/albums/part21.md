  narration: "Hey there guys! My name is TPangolin, and it‘s an absolute honor have
    all of you on board to witness a battle of absolutely crazy proportions. What
    lies ahead is a battle that will last for millennia - over 60 Civilizations, both
    Firaxis and Fan-Made will battle it out on the largest Earth Map available. Some
    areas like Europe will be a hotspot of contention, where civs will have to brutally
    fight against each other in order to gain that vital early-game upper hand. Other
    areas on the globe are much more open, but are we sure these civs will make the
    most of what they‘re given? Join us on a journey bathed in blood, where one nation
    will hopefully become victorious over 60 of their lesser global neighbors.\n \nJoin
    us as we step into the madness that is the Official /r/civ 60+ A.I Battle Royale!\nAlso
    remember to check out the Power Rankings to see where each Civilization ranks!
    - http://imgur.com/a/aZQn2/layout/horizontal#0\n \nJoining us for the narration
    today is /u/Lurking_Chronicler!\n \n“Greetings, fellow BR enthusiasts! Our glorious
    leader TPangolin has graciously allowed me to narrate Part 21. Hopefully I won’t
    make any embarrassing mistakes that’ll cause him to regret that decision. Okay,
    let’s get this show on the road!”"

  narration: And now for the Royale map, made by /u/SylonL and city flips added by
    /u/thehonestyfish! Be sure to thank the various contributors to the community,
    as well as TPang himself, because the BR wouldn’t exist without them. Now, take
    a good look at this map, as after this part, it will change forever....

  narration: "And so we begin in Indonesia, where Gajah Mada has declared war on Saladin.
    He has a pretty sizable army and navy, so he could definitely take the Ayyubids
    down… If they weren’t separated by thousands of miles of ocean.\n \nNot much else
    to see here. Indonesia continues turtling, the Champa continue to build their
    fleet, and Australia continues to mostly ignore the area. Malaysia’s pretty quiet."

  narration: "Over to Israel, where Agent Semiramis has uncovered a plot by King David
    to overthrow his fellow bottom-tier ruler Alexios Komnenos. David’s so busy plotting
    that he seems to have forgotten that he’s at war with the Ayyubids. So much for
    taking Dvin.\n \nSome other fights are going on in the periphery. Persia’s trying
    to take Ghazni from Timur, Leonidas has launched a rather pointless invasion of
    Armenia, and the Ayyubids and Arabs continue to deplete their fleets struggling
    over Bethlehem."

  narration: "Sibir’s adopted the Autocracy Ideology, which will aid them greatly
    in their war with Attila. The two don’t seem to be fighting very seriously at
    the moment, but that could change anytime.\n \nAlso, Kekkonen’s left his eastern
    cities almost undefended, except for a crowd of workers. He should probably consider
    moving some reinforcements east before Attila gets any funny ideas."

  narration: "Haile Selassie’s ended his pointless war with Nzinga. Now both of them
    can concentrate on fighting the Ayyubids, who seemed determined to retake Gondar
    from the Kongo. If Selassie can get his army northwards, he might be able to do
    some serious damage to the thinly-held Ayyubid core.\n \nTo the west, Carthage
    continues to attack Bilbais. A smaller force surrounds Dire Dawa. Things are not
    looking good for Saladin."
- scene_number: "7"

  narration: "WHAT? TYGYN DARKHAN GOES TO WAR? IN ASIA?!?\n \nFalse alarm, he’s declared
    war on Vietnam. Still, Yakutia seems to be slowly waking up. Who knows, he might
    even declare war on one of his neighbors sometime in the next dozen parts.\n \nMeanwhile,
    the Maori have done a pretty good job upgrading their fleet. In celebration, they
    declare war on the Ayyubids, like all the popular civs are doing."

  narration: Back in Africa, Saladin’s recaptured both Gondar and Bethlehem, but both
    Kongo and Arabia have pretty substantial armies nearby, so I doubt he’ll hold
    them for long. He’s holding back Israel and Ethiopia, but that isn‘t saying a
    whole lot.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene09.jpg
  narration: Back to France, where Napoleon’s launched an all-out assault to retake
    Orleans. However, this leaves Neapolis wide open for Hitler to attack, and Hitler
    already seems pretty certain to retake Cologne. France’s incompetence in this
    war is staggering. He should’ve taken York by now, but he continues to camp on
    the outskirts and let his army be picked off by English longbowmen. Ireland isn’t
    doing much better.
- scene_number: "10"

  narration: "Henry Parkes has a massive fleet (Grand Wobbegong Armada) sitting between
    Yokohama and Nagoya, which he is in the process of attacking. Meanwhile, Vietnam
    races with Australia to see who can be the one to capture Caloocan first. Meiji’s
    in a bad position. He should be bringing his fleet south to try and repel the
    Australian attackers, but he seems much more interested in trying to take Busan
    instead.\n \nMeiji must have drunk too much of God’s Sake, because I can’t another
    explanation as to why he isn’t trying to defend his home cities."
- scene_number: "11"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene11.jpg
  narration: "Elizabeth’s managed to snipe Cologne from Germany, although Hitler will
    probably take it next turn.\n \nTake a good look of the English Empire- If Malachy
    finally stops dicking around and decides to get serious about invading Canterbury,
    it’ll never be this big again."
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene12.jpg
  narration: Over in Eastern Europe, Casimir’s split his army into three parts, the
    largest of which he’s sent to invade Germany. Madness. Casimir needs to focus
    on holding Poznan right now, and preventing yet another one of his cities from
    falling to the Finnish. Wasting his army fighting the Nazis won’t help. If he
    was really smart, he could even try and retake Wroclaw to slow the Finnish advance.
    I wouldn’t hold my breath, though. At this point, it’s looking doubtful that Casimir
    will survive long enough for his Winged Hussars to make a difference. Given the
    size of the Finnish army, it’s very possible that particular ship has already
    sailed.

  narration: Here’s an obligatory shot of the Mughals, who continue to be happily
    irrelevant. The most exciting thing happening here is that Akbar  seems to have
    declared war on Vietnam. The only relevant target is the ex-Tibetan city of Senggezangbo.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene14.jpg
  narration: Henry Morgan’s made a daring voyage across the Atlantic and has settled
    the city of Portobello on the Azores. Maria probably isn’t very happy with this
    development, but quite frankly it’s her own fault for not having a better grip
    on her backyard.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene15.jpg
  narration: Here’s a shot of Newfoundland, where a massive Icelandic navy and army
    is parked. They actually seem slightly stronger than the resident Canadian forces
    assigned here.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene16.jpg
  narration: And now for a shot of Iceland proper, which seems to be engaged in peaceful
    trading operations with Ireland. Take note of Vestmannaeyjar (Quite a mouthful!),
    which is located just south of the polar ice sheet. It’s better situated than,
    say, Selfoss, but not by much.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene17.jpg
  narration: "Australia’s managed to take Caloocan, and has managed to get Nagoya
    down to the red. Yet another Australian fleet enters the region, though I doubt
    they’ll really need it. Meiji is too busy drunkenly sending his navy to attack
    Busan, and Vietnam seems reluctant to attack Australian holdings in the area.\n
    \nAlso, notice the Hawaiian tourists in the area. I like to imagine that they’re
    novelists writing gripping accounts of the Australian conquests in the area. Kamehameha
    should take note. He could very well be next."
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene18.jpg
  narration: Over in North Africa, the war turns against the Ayyubids yet again. Nzinga’s
    retaken Gondar, and it looks to be permanent this time. Harun al-Rashid’s retaken
    Bethlehem as well, though he seems to have spent most of his navy in the process.
    Hannibal besieges Bilbais and Dire Dawa, and again the Ayyubid army seems to be
    stuck fighting the largely inconsequential Ethiopian invasion. Saladin needs to
    start looking into peace treaties, and soon.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene19.jpg
  narration: "Hitler finally reunites Cologne with the rest of Germany, and sends
    his army to push deeper into France. Meanwhile, a smaller army fends off the poorly-planned
    Polish invasion to the East.\n \nTo the west, Napoleon retake Orleans again, and
    begins tentatively sending forces to approach York.\n \nTo the north, Malachy
    decides to get serious about invading England and attacks Canterbury. This could
    be the beginning of the end for Elizabeth."
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene20.jpg
  narration: "The Mayans successfully recapture Uxmal from the Buccaneers, though
    that’ll probably change soon enough. The two are locked in a stalemate. The Buccaneers
    will probably keep capturing Uxmal from the Mayans, but holding it will be tricky,
    seeing as Uxmal is one of the few places in Mayan territory that isn’t infested
    with the Hawaiian peacekeeping forces.\n \nPerhaps the recently-enlisted services
    of a certain Edward Teach can help the Buccaneers out…\n \nAlso, Ethiopia doesn’t
    seem to have very many friends, if the denouncement list is any indication."

  narration: Yakutia enters the Industrial Era. Does anyone know if they have coal
    within their borders? I certainly don’t. Anyways, Yakutia is large, powerful,
    technologically advanced, and has a large and strong army. If only they’d actually
    use it once in a while! What’s the point of having more cannons than any other
    faction if you never do anything with them?
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene22.jpg
  narration: What’s this? Agent Em’s discovered that Henry Morgan’s plotting against
    Lincoln? Not very surprising, honestly. Honest Abe better watch his back. Unless
    Lincoln is secretly holding Stephen Decatur in reserve, America will be in serious
    trouble if the pirates attack.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene23.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile, Agent Semiramis discovers that David is once again plotting
    against another bottom-tier power whom he can’t realistically reach. The Middle
    East looks identical to how it looks the last time Semiramis reported in. David
    daydreams about being able to pick on someone his own size, the Arabians defend
    Bethlehem, the Spartans grind pointlessly against Armenia, and Persia makes incremental
    progress against the Timurids.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene24.jpg
  narration: "“Where art thou Sitting Bull?” cry out the Sioux in desperation. The
    Blackfoot, Mexicans, and Texans are all racing to see who can capture the capital
    city of Hunkpapa first, while Blackfoot forces surround Unkpatina. Oyuphe is in
    the yellow, and will soon be Canadian unless the Texans try to go in for a back-door
    snipe. The Sioux’s days are numbered, and the people turn in desperation to Sitting
    Bull, hoping for him to save them. Little do they realize he’s decided to go throw
    in his lot with the equally-doomed Mayans. \nMeanwhile, the Ayyubids, determined
    to be the greatest North African pariahs to have ever lived, decide to denounce
    Persia in addition to all their neighbors."

  narration: The Sri Lankans have recruited Leif Ericsson as their Great Admiral,
    which is the most interesting thing to have happened to them in forever. India,
    much like South America, seems destined to be irrelevant.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene26.jpg
  narration: "Here’s a shot of the Inuit and Blackfoot core regions, both of which
    seem rather peaceful. The Inuit have been busy building new additions to the Ice
    Fleet Sheet, not that they’re likely to ever be able to use them.\n \nElsewhere,
    Lizzie recaptures Orleans from Napoleon and Mirwais denounces a few other civs."

  narration: It seems that Darius has finally succeeded in capturing Ghazni from Timur,
    though Timur has a rather formidable army waiting to take it back. Regardless,
    this victory seems to have been the final push needed to advance Darius into the
    Renaissance… Where he continues to be a full era behind some of his neighbors.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene28.jpg
  narration: The Top Kekks declare war on Attila, though one has to question the wisdom
    of doing this with such a small army on hand. Kekkonen had better get his army
    eastwards pretty quickly, or his workers are about to meet a nasty fate at the
    hands of the Huns.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene29.jpg
  narration: Looks like the Boers have adopted Autocracy. Also… wow. Just LOOK at
    the Boers. It’s easy to forget how powerful they are due to how rarely we get
    to see their full empire in one shot.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene30.jpg
  narration: The Australians have taken Nagoya. I somehow doubt the Japanese will
    retake it, given how spread out their forces are. Worse, Parkes has ordered a
    massive naval assault on the lightly-held capital. Meiji needs to sober up and
    start using that military prowess that’s been causing us to root for him so far,
    or he risks having the Brittanians-I mean Australians- taking over his own country
    and renaming it something like Area Eleven.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene31.jpg
  narration: Unlike Meiji, the Mexicans have managed to stay sober long enough to
    snatch Hunkpapa before the Texans can take it. Meanwhile, Oyuhe is deep in the
    red, and Unkpatina is surrounded by the Blackfeet. This spells doom for the Sioux.
    Their capital is gone, their remaining two cities in mainland North America are
    surrounded, and their leader has abandoned them for the Mayans. The MAYANS! You
    know you’re in bad shape when the Mayans are better off than you are.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene32.jpg
  narration: Looks like the Buccaneers have sent a scout to witness the fall of the
    Sioux. Maybe one day Sitting Bull will hear how the tribe he abandoned fell to
    their enemies, and return to the last remaining city the Sioux still have in the
    Arctic (that is, if they still have it by then). But that day looks to be long
    off, and for now the leaderless, hopeless Sioux are rapidly being crushed by their
    enemies.

  narration: Korea enters the Industrial Era, slightly behind some of its fellow civs
    despite its incredible scientific advancements. Even so, Korea is exceptionally
    stronk at the moment. If they decided to attack Japan from behind and split it
    down the middle with Australia, they could easily do so right now.

  narration: "Vietnam and the Cham lay siege to Manila as more Hawaiian observers
    look on. Rizal had better pick a religion and say his prayers, because Manila’s
    impending fall looks pretty set in stone.\n \nAlso, Arabia goes crazy with denouncements.
    Harun al-Rashid must be in a bad mood today."
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene36.jpg
  narration: "My goodness! Kamehameha and Sejong get in on the denouncement game as
    well. No one is spared! Not even the Snoryaks!\n \nMeanwhile, it looks like Napoleon’s
    retaken Orleans yet again, though that could change at any moment. Cologne looks
    securely in German hands, although the English are determined to change that.
    Elizabeth should be concerned that Malachy is threatening to capture Canterbury
    with his UU, the Kerns.\n \nThe French continue to be grossly incompetent. Holding
    Orleans is requiring the bulk of their army, and they aren’t even succeeding at
    that. They’re STILL unable to take York, their fleet has been completely destroyed
    by the English and Germans, and Hitler is busy reenacting WWI on their eastern
    border. Perhaps worst of all, their unit carpet is showing notable holes, which
    speaks volumes on Napoleon’s (in)ability to keep his men alive."

  narration: "Brazilian Soldier #1: “You ever wonder why we’re here?”\nBrazilian Soldier
    #2: “It’s one of life’s great mysteries isn‘t it? Why are we here? I mean, are
    we the product of some cosmic coincidence, or is there really a God watching everything?
    You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don’t know, man, but it keeps me up
    at night.”\nBrazilian Soldier #1: “…What?! I mean why are we out here, in this
    jungle?\nBrazilian Soldier #2: “Oh. Uh… yeah.”\nBrazilian Soldier #1: “What was
    all that stuff about God?”\nBrazilian Soldier #2: “Uh…hm? Nothing.”\nBrazilian
    Soldier #1: “Seriously though, why are we out here? As far as I can tell, it‘s
    just a bunch of in the middle of nowhere. No way in or out. The only reason that
    we set up Fortaleza here is because they have Machu over there. And the only reason
    they have Machu over there is because we set up Fortaleza here.”\nBrazilian Soldier
    #2:  “Yeah. That‘s because we‘re fighting each other.”\nBrazilian Soldier #1:
    “No, no. But I mean, even if we were to pull out today, and if they would come
    take over Fortaleza, they would have TWO cities in the middle of a jungle. Whoopdee-fucking-doo.”\n
    \nElsewhere…\n \nIncan Soldier#1: “What’re they doing?”\nIncan Soldier #2: “What?”\nIncan
    Soldier #1: “I said, ‘What are they doing now?”\nIncan Soldier #2: “God damn,
    I‘m getting so sick of answering that question!”"

  narration: To the north, the Buccaneers continue their assault on Uxmal. To the
    south, a certain blue-coated team of Incan soldiers are considering hiring some
    Hawaiian Freelancers to try and help them in their endless war with a certain
    team of red-coated Brazilian soldiers.

  narration: Agent Em uncovers a plot by Henry Morgan to backstab the Texans while
    they are busy finishing of the Sioux. Said Sioux are about to lose Oyuhpe to the
    Canadians, and the Blackfoot have begun the final assault on Unkpatina.

  narration: Jandamarra builds the Red Fort, which grants +12 defense in the city
    he constructs it in, and a 25% city defensive bonus across the empire, which is
    pretty nifty. It’ll certainly come in handy if the Kimberly ever go to war with
    Australia.

  narration: And with that, the Kimberly enter the Industrial Era. They’re looking
    pretty strong, especially with those Riflemen. They’re still weak compared to
    their Aussie neighbors, but then again, so is everyone.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene42.jpg
  narration: Casimir still refuses to fight sensibly and end his two-front war, and
    as such is suffering the consequences. The invasion of Germany that’s tying up
    most of his army isn’t working. He’s failing to retake Wroclaw, Poznan is under
    siege, and his interior is lightly held. Poland is perilously close to being penetrated
    by the Finns, and yet Casimir still doesn’t seem to take the situation seriously.
    Casimir’s recklessness could be the downfall of his country if this keeps up much
    longer.

  narration: "Attila invades the Finnish settlements bordering him, though Kekkonen
    does send some cannons as reinforcements.\n \nMuch more significant is that Attila
    has evidently decided that Sibir can have Bakihon if he wants it. Otherwise, how
    else do you do explain him leaving the city undefended like that? It’s ridiculous."

  narration: Canterbury looks like it’s about to fall soon. Elizabeth seems to be
    condensing her forces around London to prepare for the increasingly inevitable
    outcome that London becomes England’s last toehold in the British Isles. Things
    are grim for Lizzie.
- scene_number: "45"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part21-scene45.jpg
  narration: Elsewhere, the Kimberly have heard tales of the Australian settlement
    of Broken Hill and decided that they too want to settle a city in the most isolated
    spot possible. While it lacks the same amount of isolation that Broken Hill has,
    it is in a slightly more convenient location. Emphasis on “slightly”.

  narration: Lots of stuff is going in the Caucasus region. Armenia and Sparta declare
    to end their wasteful, inconclusive war in Anatolia, though it’s anyone’s guess
    how long this peace will actually last. Sparta decides to follow up this peace
    treaty with several denunciations. To the east, Timur recruits Vasco da Gama as
    a Great Admiral, though thus rankly doesn’t seem too useful given the location
    in the Caspian Sea. To the north, Attila continues to let Sibir take free shots
    at Baikhon.

  narration: Speaking of Attila, the presence of Finnish cannons in San Bartolo seem
    to be acting as a pretty good deterrent for the Huns. The same can’t be said of
    Joensuu, which is now overrun.

  narration: Back to Japan, where the apparently bottomless Australian navy is launching
    attacks on Osaka as well as Tokyo. The Japanese navy is just too small and spread
    out to repel the Aussie menace, and Meiji will need a miracle if he wants to stop
    losing to Parkes.

  narration: "Damn. Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo are all under attack, as well as most
    of the Japanese navy. I’m not sure what motivated Meiji to found Wakayama, as
    it opens up yet another easy target for the Australians, and it’ll create a lot
    of overlap conflict between Kyoto and Tokyo. Things look very bad for the Japanese
    right now, but there is still hope; the Australian navy’s taken a lot of damage,
    and if Meiji can outlast them he just might be able to scrape through this. If
    he gets really lucky, it’s possible that he could even retake Nagoya.\n \nHowever,
    this all depends on the Koreans. If Sejong were to declare war on Japan right
    now, it would be game over for Meiji."

  narration: "Big trouble in Little England. Hitler and Napoleon have signed a peace
    deal, meaning that both of them are now free to attack England at their leisure.
    Indeed, Germany, the major beneficiary of this peace deal, is already sending
    forces to harass London. This came at the worst possible time. Malachy’s completely
    surrounded Canterbury and is about to take it, and all English units have been
    pulled back to London. If both Germany and Ireland decide to attack London, the
    English could be completely pushed off the British Isles.\n \nNapoleon isn’t doing
    well either. He’s lost Cologne, he could still lose Orleans, his army’s in tatters,
    and HE STILL CAN’T TAKE YORK!\n \nMeanwhile, the Swedes continue their attempts
    to invade Germany. Despite being at war with Germany for some time, they really
    haven’t made any notable progress in this endeavor."

  narration: "Let’s take a closer look at Anatolia. Sparta’s made peace with Armenia,
    though not much was really happening here anyways. The Spartans didn’t even manage
    to attack any cities!\n \nTo the north, you can see the Last Legion under Mark
    Anthony attempting to gain sanctuary from the Byzantines, though the Byzantines
    don’t seem to have any room to spare."

  narration: Over in North Africa, it looks like Hannibal’s decided to leave Dire
    Dawa for Nzinga and shift gears towards capturing Alexandria instead of Bilbais.
    It seems that Saladin’s building Mamluks, which he’ll need a lot more of if he
    doesn’t want to get swallowed up by his neighbors.

  narration: The Trung Sisters seem to have abandoned their attack on Mao. Mao’s launching
    his own attack against Vietnam, though it doesn’t look like it’ll go anywhere.
    Meanwhile, the Japanese fleet continues to disintegrate. Now would be an excellent
    opportunity for Korea to attack Busan, China, or Japan, possibly even all three.
    I doubt such a chance will come again anytime some.

    moment. Both Brazil and Chile could make short work of Argentina if they tried,
    but neither seem interested. South America remains boring as usual. \nThe most
    interesting thing happening here is Rome denouncing Portugal. The Last Legion
    must not like the idea of Maria the Mad occupying their former capital."

  narration: The Buccaneers retake Uxmal yet again. It remains to be seen whether
    or not they can hold it, though, as the Mayans have dispatched most of their army
    (including Sitting Bull, who either doesn’t know about the plight of the Sioux
    or has stopped caring) to stop the Buccaneers from taking one of their few remaining
    cities.

  narration: Okay, forget what I said earlier about Japan being able to possibly outlast
    the Australians and retake Nagoya, because that isn’t going to happen. Wakayama
    and Osaka are under heavy assault, the Japanese navy has been wrecked, and unless
    the Japanese secure a peace deal rather quickly, most of the cities on the island
    of Japan are going to be Australian. Japan will probably survive this invasion,
    but any chance of the Empire of the Rising Sun becoming a regional power is gone.
    The sun has started to set on Meiji, and if Korea and the Inuit decide to gang
    up on Japan as well, it’s going to set a lot quicker.

  narration: The city of Kiyaksa is all that remains of the Sioux now, and likely
    will be for some time to come. Though Kiyaksa is isolated and hard to attack,
    it is also situated in very inhospitable terrain, and there really isn’t anything
    the Sioux will be able to do from now on except for waiting for Sitting Bull to
    return to them. Even when this happens, they probably won’t be able to do much
    except turtle and wait for Canada or the Inuit to finish them off.  This is a
    very sad fate for the once-proud Sioux.

  narration: "I WARNED YOU ABOUT TWO-FRONT WARS BRO! I TOLD YOU DOG!\n \nWe now get
    to see the results of Casimir attempts to fight the Nazis and Finns simultaneously.
    It hasn’t worked out well for him. His army is fragmenting, not helped by him
    sending his units to go swim in the Black Sea. Casimir needs peace treaties badly,
    or else his enemies are going to continue to chip away at him from all sides until
    Poland is no more.\n \nAmazingly enough, the Byzantines are not only still in
    this game, but are actually doing better than a bunch of other civs. This is probably
    due to the strange absence of most of the Soviet Army. Where is Stalin hiding
    it?"
