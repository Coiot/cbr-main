    Come one, come all to the r/civ’s civbattleroyale! This part is hectic (as of writing this I’ve only seen half the part, fun!) I’m /u/_xSyracuse, and welcome to the 71st part. God, I really had no idea what I wanted to type there, that sounds so bad. Let’s keep it! Anyway, last part we saw a whole lot of Orange, and that when mixed, Dark Green and Black create Orange. Anyway, this part… may or may not be any different. We’ll find out soon, I guess. Anyway, let’s get STRAIGHT into the…. Part? PART!
    This spectacularly well made oc is made by /u/Spherical_Melon and is a watercolor painting of an Icelandic Submarine.

  narration: Last part was a rather large part, which we saw the declarations of the
    Inuit and Vietnam on the Boers. The Ryk also peaced out with Sweden, and Australia
    also peaced out Vietnam.

  narration: 'Paul Kruger takes the #1 spot in the PRs, but since the wars with Ethiopia
    and the Buccaneers began, there is certainly no doubt that their position has
    been earned.'

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene06.jpg
  narration: This map made by /u/AcipenserSturio shows the current coalition on the
    Boers. Notice that most of the world powers are currently trying to contain the
    Ryk, but to no avail. Ethiopia and the Buccaneers are currently on the front line,
    but soon, Vietnam, Sibir, and possibly even Brazil may join them on the frontline.

  narration: |-
    Ethiopia seems to have a large amount of Paratroopers that would seriously help in their defence against the Boers  up near Artashat and Gyumri. Either the radio is out and the troops cannot receive direct instructions, or perhaps they‘re to be utilised in a major counteroffensive.
    Meanwhile, Vietnam‘s freedom tiles stands in the way of Armenia hosting a contiguous land empire.

  narration: |-
    The Free City of Dvin further establishes itself as a home for the fallen, housing Hunnic, French and Timurid refugees whilst the Hawaiian diaspora struggles to gain entry to their wonderful city.
    It also seems that Sweden is going to continue to do Sweden, as they plot against Sparta for the 3928101st time. Apparently, Dvin the glorious canal that is, can no longer be a haven for the dead civs of the world

  narration: Speaking of dead units, Songstan Gampo the Glorious of Tibet is plotting
    against Attila the Hun. Maybe Songstan still thinks that he’s still out there
    somewhere, burning down houses in nearly destroyed Sibir cities. Dang it Attila,
    stop burning things down.

  narration: The city of Bamako is surrounded on all fronts by Boer units, except
    for the sea. The Buccaneers rule the sea. Anyway, it looks as if the Boers are
    pushing towards Sale and Rabat, while small skirmishes take place on the rest
    of the Boer-Buccaneer front.

  narration: The Boers primary invasion force, Hover Tanks and Vertols are pushing
    deeper and deeper into Ethiopia. Ethiopia has just lost Harar and Adawa, but currently
    maintain control of Addis Ababa. Although, looking around, it seems that Ethiopia
    has only 4 (visible) cities not in deep red- Cairo, Bethlehem, Jericho, and Damascus.

  narration: |-
    Our beloved agents Em, Semiramis, and Ishtar have received their new assignments, to Pretoria, Nedong, and Kangiqtiniq.
    In the real world, Kangiqtiniq is a small Inuit hamlet in Nunavut that once recieved 40% of the vote to be the location of Nunavut‘s capital. Nedong on the other hand was the seat of the Phagmodrupa dynasty, which was the dominating regime in Tibet from 1354 to 1435 and maintained a degree of authority until the early 17th century.

  narration: A war the world nearly completely forgot  about- Yakutia and Afghanistan
    has finally come to an end. Nothing resulted of it of course, but still, this
    gives us an excellent to look at Vietnam. They have a massive UAV carpet- that’s
    actually terrifying- but I really don’t see much of anything else.
- scene_number: "14"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene14.jpg
  narration: In another war nearly everyone had forgotten about in the excitement
    of ‘Nam v. Australia and Boer attempted gang bang, nothing is still happening.
    Nothing, except for a nuke in Turinsk and Oymyakon. Both sides are still stalemating,
    and this seriously reminds of the past Sibit/Yakutia war.
- scene_number: "15"

  narration: "Nukes everywhere! More Mexican named Inuit Cities! More Flips! \nWait…
    rewind… Flips? Yes! Your eyes are NOT lying to you, Yakutia actually captured
    the first city when they conquered Igloolik. It’s most likely going to flip right
    back, because Inuit Unit Purchasing.\nAs for the Mexican City names: see Top Right.
    And as for nukes: look nearly anywhere on the screen."

  narration: |-
    Here’s the Inuit Core, which consists of Stupendously big Snow Cities, a few XCOMs, waaayyyy to many Cybersubs and Arsenal Ships, and a whole lot of Blackfoot Paratroopers!
    Seriously though, Inuit, build some Advanced Destroyers for your own good
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene17.jpg
  narration: "Still not many Advanced Destroyers floating around in Inuit Waters…\nBut
    anyway, I still see more Vietnamese Units then Inuit units, and that is not a
    good thing. \nIceland does Iceland… Ships with no land units."

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene18.jpg
  narration: "Big moment in Mexico right now!\nAustralia makes a push cand captures
    Monterrey, Torreon and Merida, as Mexico pushes yet again with their Mechanized
    Infantry to take Austin yet again, and this time, they don’t have a Melee unit
    to replace it. \nCiudad Juarez gets another dosage of nuclear radiation."
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene19.jpg
  narration: Judaism fails yet again to get past the world congress as the world religion,
    while the boers push yet again on Ethiopia. I can’t quite tell what cities they’ve
    just taken, although i can tell you that they just damaged Cairo for the first
    time!

  narration: |-
    Here’s a shot at Sibir’s core while we acknowledge that Historical landmarks was also not passed.
    Alright, now that we moved on, look at the new city of Zibo, and also the Roman Ballista, along with the two Chinese Knights.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene21.jpg
  narration: |-
    Here’s a nice shot of Vietnam’s Highly Dense, industrial, semi-carpeted core. It’s quite impressive, with large cities such as Saigon, Hoi An (Hi Lung!) Tianjin, Hai Phong and Vijaya dotting the landscape.
    Although, the real reason we’re looking at this slide is that Tibet is plotting against Sparta. Which in reality, is quite sad that Tibet think’s their stronger the Sparta.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene22.jpg
  narration: "EAT YOUR WORDS, /u/TA_Knight! We aren’t sleepy anymore!\nSorry about
    that, my inner Iceland fanboy has come out in full crazy mode. Let me deal with
    that real quick…\nAlright, Iceland has declared war on the Boers, joining basically
    every other major power in the game other than Finland, Much like Sibir, Vietnam,
    and the Inuit, this DOW will not be very relevant until/if the Boers conquer Iberiarr,
    as it seems Paul Kruger has stopped building XCOMs. \nAlso, I was in class trying
    to sneakily narrate this and I fell out of my chair when I saw that Iceland did
    a thing. What a great supporter I am. /s\nOh, and TA, Iceland can into relevance."

  narration: "Darius is alive! \n3 Privateers and a Submarine float along near Ireland,
    now relegated to the task of acting as pirates in international waters ambushing
    embarked Vietnamese expeditionary forces for meagre supplies to help them in their
    upcoming struggles."

    the globe.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene25.jpg
  narration: It seems that Iceland is ready for war with the Boers, as Atomic Bombs
    are already stationed inside of Sparta, and i’m sure Rome has one or two as well.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene26.jpg
  narration: |-
    It seems that Malian Nuclear Holocaust Mk. II is going just how Captain Morgan had planned… if he had planned to be losing and nuking cities off the map, and was the Defender in the war. God, I’m actually beginning to think that Captain Morgan is not having things go his way!
    Also, amidst the Nuclear Hellfire, Buccaneer refugees have set up the city of Basse-Terre. That is probably not going to survive the part.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene27.jpg
  narration: "Here’s a shot of Korea’s Core, which doesn’t look as terrifying in Strategic
    Mode as it does in regular mode. \nI really don’t know what else to say on this
    slide… So.. tell me how the weather is where you live and what country is is!
    US, Russia, UK, and Australia, cities/provinces/territories please because they’re
    large af."
- scene_number: "28"

  narration: We also get a quick overview of Yakutia in Strategic mode, where there
    are more Brazilians than Yakutians!
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene29.jpg
  narration: And Finally, the stalemate has been broken, as a Marine sneakily sniped
    the city overnight… although Sibir will quickly take it back after their turn
    processes.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene30.jpg
  narration: "Mexico has recaptured the cities of Monterrey and Torreon, and Texas
    had recaptured their own capital. But, alas, Mexico recaptures the city of Austin.
    \nAlso, as of right now, Henry Morgan and the Buccaneers are technically winning,
    owning a total of 7 (!) Capitals!"
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene31.jpg
  narration: Cairo has flipped, as I’m sure most of the cities on screen has. The
    Boers really are making quick work of Ethiopia cities like Baalbek and Ejura falling.
    Hippo Regius, Kwilu, and Gades, the current capital of Ethiopia look to be the
    next to fall.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene32.jpg
  narration: |-
    SWARM!
    That’s basically what Kumasi looks like right now. Boers units are on every side of the obliterated former Ashanti capital.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene33.jpg
  narration: |-
    All of Ethiopian Ethiopia has fallen to the Boers, except for two small towns on the tip of Somalia, but Hover Tanks are already breaking down their walls. Honestly, I’m a little shocked that anyone thought that Ethiopia could beat the Boers at all, and by this performance by Paul Kruger of getting rid of their only real competition right now in a matter of turns, I don’t see a way to stop them.
    The Ashanti after generations of being militaristic lake nomads reclaim their lake legs as the new empty land is almost a frightening prospect to navigate. Hearing promises of more nomads like themselves in the former Ethiopian lake was reason enough to embark on a journey to meet with the “Lost Riflemen of Marrakech”. Their journey however looks to be in vain, as there are no damn Moroccans anywhere in sight.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene34.jpg
  narration: How would one describe Yakutia? A land of peacekeepers. Brazilian peacekeepers
    are currently abundant within the Snoryak Empire, but in previous parts the were
    usually filled with Finnish units, usually only having enough room for their own
    workers and ships. Although Brazil doesn’t have a carpet like Finland, I wouldn’t
    be surprised if one magically appeared over the coming parts.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene35.jpg
  narration: It seems as if the Vietnam war hurt ‘Straya’s carpet as much as it did
    Vietnam’s, and that the war may of ended in a stalemate.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene36.jpg
  narration: As predicted, Rome is filled with Atomic Bombs waiting for the Boers
    to conquer Northern Africa. I don’t think Iceland has used a Nuclear Bomb before,
    so it will be interesting to see if they will in this war.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene37.jpg
  narration: It seems that the Aussie conquest of Mexico will have to be put on hold,
    with the extreme lack of Aussie Naval Destroyers. I see a total of 4, but one
    is about to die, and another is closer to Honolulu then a Mexican city.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene38.jpg
  narration: |-
    Gosh Dangit Ekeuhnick, why do you have Nukes all over the world? He currently has nukes in the Gulf of Persia, the West coast of Australia, and now, Buccaneer Africa. Although this is strategic and fun to have, it’s a waste of nukes that he could throw at Yakutia!
    Also, Iceland has 1 Advanced Destroyer outside Marrakech, which they could be able to snipe.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene39.jpg
  narration: Lots of dead civs of the Horn of Africa, including Burma, Morocco, Sri
    Lanka, and Hawaii. Wait? Sri Lanka and Hawaii are still alive? I had completely
    forgotten. Anyway, they are all fleeing from Ethiopia as the Boers conquer it.

  narration: |-
    Mongolia can into technology!
    Unless that’s a Boer loaner for the open borders, Mongolia has teched up enough for Nuclear Missiles, and maybe if he plays his cards right, he can whip a Yakut city off the map!
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene41.jpg
  narration: |-
    The Boers conquered Gades, and only Gades somehow. Anyway, Ethiopia relocated their capital somewhere currently unknown, but as Boer hover tanks and Giant Death Robots swarm northern africa, Ethiopian soldiers and civilians are piling into the sea to see refuge in Buccaneer Italy, Sparta, or Finnish Greece.
    Meanwhile, in the mini-map we see that because the backup Ethiopian paratroopers were called to war - the Afghani colony of Gymuri was invaded and taken over by Sibir.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene42.jpg
  narration: Gades flips again, but honestly, Ethiopian Africa is toast. I don’t see
    a way for them to recover, unless they peace out right now, Ethiopia may be exiled
    to Arabia. A unified force of Buccaneers and Iceland may be able to establish
    strongholds in North Africa, but for the most part, anything subsaharan is destined
    to be orange.

    us juicy information about who these leaders recently had a petty fight with.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part71-scene44.jpg
  narration: "TEXAS SHALL LIVE!\nYes, this just in, Texas and Mexico peaced out with
    Texas in control of Laredo! They didn’t own a single melee unit, so Houston was
    quite smart in peacing out with his life. \nAlso, I’m pretty sure that’s 60% of
    the Inuit’s ground troops on their Mexican border, but they also have a settler
    at the ready if Monterrey is nuked out off the planet."

    Here we see Pretoria, the capital of the Ry- holy crap look at that Science number. That’s just impressive. I’m not even mad, I’m jealous. I know they’re using their Production for research, but that is a crazy high number. And since they are working a total of 9 tiles, only 4 of which give food, I give you the OP-ness of Future Worlds buildings/wonders
    Meanwhile, an extremely sexually charged rendition of the Afghani leader Mirwais Hotak resides in the capital‘s Staatsmuseum.

  narration: Here we have an Inuit City-Kangiqtiniq home of Al Burj and the highest
    metro population in the Inuit Empire. It currently is still growing, and wields
    a lot of production.

  narration: Nedong. Glorious Nedong. Not much to say about it, but for a 2 pop city
    it has decent production. After gaining inspiration from their Lotus Blossom Chorten,
    the citizens of Nedong wish to entertain themselves with Opera, much to the confusion
    of the surrounding Finns. Different strokes for different folks I guess.

  narration: "The Australians complete the Shimizu Mega City Pyramid, which in our
    world is a proposed structure for Tokyo Bay, Japan that could house over 1,000,000
    people. It is currently not even possible to be built, as it relies on the future
    availability of of Carbon Nanotubes that are currently being researched. With
    an estimated completion time of 2100, by then that will be only a fraction of
    Tokyo’s expected population. \nYeah, I told you that because I don’t have access
    to what it offers to be built ingame."

  narration: City-State to City-State, Houston hates Meiji. While this DOW entails
    nothing, it does remind me of the Order of the Rump series, which mysteriously
    disappeared a few weeks ago. I really wish it came back, as it was an extremely
    interesting series to watch.

  narration: As the final Sonallian cities fall to the Boers, the Ashanti Pikeman
    slowly makes their way to the ocean. They have long done laps in his lake in Boer
    Territory and visited schools in nearby cities, but they cannot remember the last
    time they had been out of the Boer territory, and this was their best chance.

  narration: I see a surprising lack of units on the Boer-Buccaneer war- on both sides.
    And that could be a good or bad thing. Is the Boer war machine finally slowing

  narration: Iceland valiantly captures the city of Bamako, a city on the West Coast
    of Africa that has seen a lot in the past 30 or so parts. This 420 noscope by
    Ingolfur Arnarson will not hold, but it’s nice to prove to the world’s leaders
    that Iceland can do what Vietnam, the Inuit, and Sibir cannot.

  narration: Ethiopia has done it! Klerksdorp has been nuked. Klerksdorp was a massive
    city- 44 pop i do believe, and the citizens there must be growing their third
    arms by now.

    Cue Meiji peeing his own pants.
    The Inuit are currently plotting against poor, old Japan, and if I were Meiji, I would just give him my city. Japan would really not have a chance.

  narration: The Trung sisters have officially hit hit phase of “Settle every city
    humanly possible”, as both of these cities are brand spanking new. If we saw other
    places in their empire, we would probably see even more infant cities, but for
    now, enjoy these cool Vietnamese City Names.

  narration: Suntar is nuked for the first time (presumably by Kuchum Khan) and Khonuu
    falls prey to even more artillery shells from the north.

  narration: The Inuit have captured the city of Russkoye Ustye, and with 4 XCOMs
    in the area and only a few Yakut units, who knows, perhaps the city will stay
    in Inuit Hands.

  narration: "Okay, Tobolsk is one scary looking cities. With Industrial Complexes
    all around it, it has got to have a good production output. TPang - if you ever
    do another screenshot release of the game with no UI, please include this Siberian
    city. \nTPang‘s note - I‘ll post a picture of Tobolsk without the UI alongside
    this part!"

  narration: The Boers still have the title of the highest population, by almost double
    the runner up! Although, I would not be surprised if their war growth moved into
    the negatives with all the nukes that have hit the Boers in this part.

    Now THAT is interesting. The Boer War Machine does seem to be slowing down, as they have moved down to 5th in manpower, behind Iceland. Paul Kruger has obviously lost a lot of men in the coalition war, so it will be interesting to see if they will fall farther in part 72
    Australia further rises up the ranks as having the largest military in the world. It helps that the majority of countries in the top 10 are embroiled in a series of wars though.

    And the Inuit have passed the Boers for tech, due to their code giving them an extra invisible tech at the beginning of the game. At this point where the Inuit have discovered everything, an alternate theory has arisen that they started mashing together random words in an effort to “out-tech” the Boers who have also discovered everything.
     Anyway, Iceland has fallen quite a few places since part 69, and have been on 91 tech for a long time. I’ve also heard that Vietnam has been stuck one tech for a while too, but I don’t know if that still remains.

  narration: Here’s a new stat- total faith accumulated. The Blackfoot and Armenia
    top the list top the list by a large amount, and Sibir comes in 3rd. It’s really
    not surprising because none of these civs have religions to use all this faith
    on.

    Catholicism continues to dominate follower count. Buddhism continues to dominate more cities than Oriental Orthodoxy despite having fewer followers.
    Each follower is representative of around a million people.

    Aaaanndddd here’s the religion map… Remember that the religion map also allows us to take a look at new cities, alongside razed ones.
    Alright everyone, that is the end of this part! I know it hasn’t been the best, and a rollercoaster of quality, but it’s done and hopefully this is out in time! I hope you all have a wonderful day, week, month, and year! This has been /u/_xSyracuse, signing out!
