  narration: Greetings, fellow denizens of the Sub! Welcome to Part 95 of this crazy
    Battle Royale. This is u/DerErlenkonig, Iceland fanboy extraordinaire. Courtesy
    of u/Squato, we see a distressed denizin of the Dai Viet being dragged to his
    doom by a dutiful Digger. Goddamn!
- scene_number: "2"

  narration: My very own Tile Accurate Map! Hopefully I’ve lived up to the name and
    didn’t make any stupid mistakes.
- scene_number: "3"

  narration: Here we have u/edse1911’s fantastic Average Map of the Cylinder. Many
    once strong empires are clearly visible, including Yakutia, Canada, Ethiopia,
    and even America! You have to wonder how well integrated these people actually
    are. I imagine massive revolts are commonplace.
- scene_number: "4"

  narration: 'Shocking development as Armenia doesn’t make it to #1 in the Power Rankings!
    Please contact your senators and tell them to right this egregious wrong. Every
    little bit helps, friends!'
- scene_number: "5"
  scene_title: Image 05

  narration: Right off the bat, Sibir and Sweden clash in Ukraine. Numerically the
    battle seems quite even, but a closer look reveals a much more desperate situation
    for the Swedes. Biotroopers, the DNA unit, have 120 combat strength while the
    Swedish Organic Infantry have 100 combat strength. Sibir also sports a healthy
    fleet of 9 aircraft, compared to Sweden’s 2. Gustavus has had an amazing showing
    for how relatively weak his empire is, so the fate of this war is not certain.
    If I were him, I’d be pushing for peace with Iceland ASAP to focus on the eastern
    onslaught.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: Image 06
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene06.jpg
  narration: To the North, a wall of Biotroopers lay siege to Stalingrad, it’s namesake
    an honoring of the leader of some measly Renaissance nation. Things look absolutely
    dire for Sweden.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene07.jpg
  narration: Sweden never fails to surprise me. Southern Germany hosts a healthy composition
    of units. Tegea seems firmly Icelandic, but with nearly every city in Southern
    Europe at 0 Health, a lucky snipe can turn the tide of war.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene08.jpg
  narration: Cologne is retaken but Neapolis is lost. It’ll be endless flips until
    Iceland reaches the gates of Berlin.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene09.jpg
  narration: The North Sea is adrift with countless dead men. No progress is made
    for either side but bombing runs rage on as the Atlantic Garbage Patch slowly
    seeps into battle.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene10.jpg
  narration: Constantly hearing about how dangerous the situation in the South China
    Sea is in our world, shots like this make me grateful nothing has gone hot. Kimberly
    has flooded Southern Vietnam with countless Peacekeepers, perhaps to spite their
    old Australian foe.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene11.jpg
  narration: With the knowledge acquired in the International Space Station, Vietnam
    has unlocked the secrets of Biotroopers. A surge of patriotic Vietnamese retake
    Dong Hoi and Hoi An, but the damage has been done. Nearly 40 Million Vietnamese
    citizens lay dead on Hainan alone.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene12.jpg
  narration: Isfahhan is eradicated as the Vietnamese storm Susa and prepare to retake
    Kabul. The unstoppable tide of Border Gore has officially reached India.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene13.jpg
  narration: Thi Li Bi Nai is captured but Panduranga holds strong as Australia fails
    to send any melee units. Vietnam has a whopping 70(!) Aircraft defending their
    homeland. Combined with the spiteful Kimberly Peacekeepers, Australia will find
    making any further progress here incredibly difficult.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene14.jpg
  narration: Australia flips back Hoi An and prepares to retake Dong Hoi. A sea of
    units swarm Southern China, and unless peace can be made soon, I expect Saigon
    to be lost soon.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene15.jpg
  narration: Genghis Khan shakes his fist at Sibir, but I’d be shocked if they do
    anything. IF they surprise everyone and attack, don’t expect a glorious Mongolian
    comeback. Even though Sibir is mostly empty, keep in mind how terribly behind
    Mongolia is in tech, not to mention that as of Part 94, their production is nearly
    10 TIMES SMALLER than Sibir! Realistically, war would decimate their obsolete
    army within a few turns, until the Wrath of Khan was brought down on the meager
    empire.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene16.jpg
  narration: Susa flips back and the Boer reinforcements have nearly arrived. A well
    placed Atomic Bomb could seriously slow their advance. However, it’s easy to forget
    the AI can’t see everything. Persia is a dark void of uncertainty, and they may
    not expect another wave.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene17.jpg
  narration: Stalingrad appears to have flipped as the pressure mounts on Sweden.
    They have a huge airforce but planes can’t take cities.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene18.jpg
  narration: Neither side has a decisive advantage. Sweden hasn’t reached the breaking
    point yet, but when they do, I expect progress to be much faster for Iceland.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene19.jpg
  narration: Drone Fighters! This is the final upgrade of the Fighter Line, sporting
    100 combat strength and a range of 12 tiles. Bombers will always be more useful,
    but at least the carriers are being used for something.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene20.jpg
  narration: 'A rare shot of Pirate Senegal and Cabo Verde. Or as the Boers understand
    it: a stain on the map. The Boer Worker Carpet continues to do what they do best:
    turning the Sahara green and making turn times miserable. It’s notable that the
    Boers have open borders with both Iceland and the Buccs; hopefully this means
    friendly relations.'
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene21.jpg
  narration: Not a melee boat in sight around Florida. The Buccs and the Blackfoot
    are spilling into Inuit lands, so it appears North America will continue to bore.
    Unit wise, the Blackfoot still lag behind dramatically with their modern units,
    but the Buccs have surprisingly caught up and sport Biotroopers. This would do
    little more than delay the inevitable if war breaks out with the Inuit, but I
    have to hand it to Morgan for catching up with his limited resources.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene22.jpg
  narration: Flips, flips, and more flips. Panduranga remains Australian but it probably
    won’t last. As the former Cham capital, it’s a huge prize if Australia manages
    to hold it.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene23.jpg
  narration: Good news, Korea fans! You have a grand total of One Advanced Destroyer!
    Sounds like nothing, but what if I told you that through this entire part, there
    isn’t a single Australian Advanced Destroyer?
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene24.jpg
  narration: Nedong reunites with the Khanate. Truthfully, I was hoping Tibet would
    get liberated, but with how hated they were, I severely doubt it’ll ever happen.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene25.jpg
  narration: The tides are turning in Iceland’s favor as Corinth falls. Ohrid is barely
    holding on and Constantinople is entirely undefended. Balkanskaga will be united
    under one banner!
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene26.jpg
  narration: 'I have a theory that there is an international corporation, based out
    of Port Royale, that specializes in carrier production. This international super-conglomerate
    has government contracts all over the world, and the Buccaneers prop up this corrupt
    entity to maintain global sway. The Icelandic Alþingi is just one of many governments
    bought off by Big Carrier, giving massive subsidies to build a useless fleet in
    exchange for election funding. #OccupyRekjavik'
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene27.jpg
  narration: The Boers, lacking much of a human government at all, is immune to the
    demands of Big Carrier and sports only a few of the worthless lugs. Kruger isn’t
    known for his naval prowess, but this defensive fleet will make any invasion from
    the sea a logistical nightmare, even without any melee units.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene28.jpg
  narration: "“Hell no, we won’t go!” Panduranga falls and progress stalls. Protests
    throughout the Australia erupt as news of the death toll pervades life in the
    Australian Empire."
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene29.jpg
  narration: Even as their homeland burns and their colonies are eradicated, the Indian
    Ocean looks well populated and strong. Not too many carriers and huge population
    centers from Sri Lanka to Myanmar. If they lose the Temple of Artemis, we could
    see a Great Vietnamese Famine.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene30.jpg
  narration: The Khanate secures Stalingrad and begins landing forces on the Kola
    Peninsula. I would move those planes out of Jyväskylä if I were Gustavus.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene31.jpg
  narration: Ohrid becomes Icelandic, Jyvaskyla becomes Siberian, and Nedong becomes
    Swedish. Constantinople is within grasp and with a little effort, Adrianople could
    be Icelandic too. This is Swedish Ragnarok.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene32.jpg
  narration: I’m not sure what Kamehameha is doing, but he’s doing something right.
    Kaneohe has over 30 Million Hawaiians sharing the real-world island of Palau.
    The entire landmass is only 466 square km, assuming no crazy atoll expansion has
    happened. That’s about 66 thousand people per square km! Henry Parkes isn’t very
    happy with this beautiful ocean metropolis, and secretly plots to make it just
    as lame as all his surrounding islands.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene33.jpg
  narration: The Vietnamese Core looks dangerously barren. Citizens better get some
    shelter, or else they’re gonna fade away.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene34.jpg
  narration: The Boer Ryk watches quietly from the Black Sea as Sibir marches on.
    Moscow is heavily defended but I can’t imagine they’ll hold much longer. Sibir
    has over twice the production and each city taken widens that gap.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene35.jpg
  narration: Constantinople is little more than a hollowed out shell now, but it has
    been returned to Icelandic rule. It’s a shame to see what this once great city
    has become.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene36.jpg
  narration: Cologne is nearly retaken. Norway and Denmark are at critical health,
    but no units look ready to make landfall.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene37.jpg
  narration: The Duchy of Beryozovo has stagnated, but otherwise is looking pretty
    solid for a tiny arctic city. I fully expect them to survive into the very end
    of the game since there is absolutely no reason to take the city.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene38.jpg
  narration: Despite international condemnation and heavy sanctions by the United
    States of Australia, Korea has aggressively pursued their nuclear program. Four
    ICBMs are prepared to fire on anyone who thinks Korea is a weak empire. Henry
    Parkes tweets that Sejong is short and stupid looking.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene39.jpg
  narration: Kuchum Khan has officially collected all the Jyväskyläs on the map!
    It’ll almost certainly be flipped back, but every captures makes it more difficult
    for Sweden to repel their invaders.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene40.jpg
  narration: Lodz and Munich are well defended, but Cologne is firmly Icelandic (and
    we even got some extra tiles out of it!). Hamburg is ripe for the taking and past
    the front lines, Europe lays bare. If only Big Carrier didn’t cripple our military
    industrial complex, half of Sweden would have been taken already.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene41.jpg
  narration: InfoAddict time! I know, I know, a bit short. Here we have an interesting
    chart of Landmass since the revival. Sweden perfectly parallels the fall of Finland,
    while Brazil and Iceland zip back and forth between 4th and 5th as Vietnam plummets.
    If Sibir and Iceland can integrate about half of Sweden’s empire each, they will
    each fall just short of the Inuit.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene42.jpg
  narration: Not too many surprises in this slide. The Yaks have reverted to hunter
    gatherers while Korea, Vietnam and Iceland break through the barriers of science.
    Offscreen, most if not all empires have completed the tech tree.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene43.jpg
  narration: With over 1 Million gold, the Boers could buy units out of every city
    every turn for god knows how long. As history has told us, the AI is not exactly
    smart enough to do this. Remember when Champa had over 500k at the time of their
    death?
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part95-scene44.jpg
  narration: |-
    Even the hunter gatherers of Yakutia, barely scraping by on arctic foxes and shrubs, have more gold than Finland. If we assume this statistic is roughly equal to their GDP, Finland is barely doing better than real-world Micronesia. I suppose a collection of tiny islands isn’t that different from what they have become.
    Aaaaand that’s all folks! This has been u/DerErlenkonig, and I’ll see you all in the comments. Cheers!
