  narration: Welcome back to the Civilization Battle Royale part 97! We’re nearing
    the 100 episode mark, and the competition is fiercer than ever. Here we have some
    wishful thinking for Mongolia’s future, courtesy of /u/GRG904. Someday, just maybe,
    Genghis will have his day.

  narration: And the tile-accurate map as well, provided by /u/DerErlekonig. Spot
    your favorite bordergore! Mine’s the Swedish tiles south of Gaza.

  narration: 'As for the Power Rankings, Kruger retains his iron grip on the #1 position.
    It would take a lot of surprises for him to lose this position anytime soon.'

  narration: We open today with a shot of the Siberian/Swedish war front, where Sibir
    has claimed Antioch on the Black Sea while Sweden has flipped Moscow. This front
    is full of city flips, but Sibir definitely has the upper hand at the moment.
    The Swedish military looks pretty thin on the ground.

  narration: 'Here’s the Indus River valley, the current front in the Boer/Vietnam
    war. Eagle-eyed viewers pointed out last part what is highlighted in this slide:
    the destruction of Lashkar Gar, joining the list of cities in this area nuked
    off the map (see also: Tarsus, Susa, Herat, and Isfahhan). Vietnamese forces have
    assembled near Mazar-i-Sharif, wary of the Boer reinforcements en route from Gordium.'

  narration: |-
    On the other Vietnamese war front, against Australia, things haven’t changed much. Aussie forces have Thi Li Bi Nai at the moment, but most coastal cities down here are flipping regularly.
    Incense is banned at the UN, over Boer objections. Meanwhile, this part of the Pacific is relatively quiet, with most of Australia’s units having been sent to the front. Also visible is Crowfoot making good decisions and building naval melee units, with 2 on this slide compared to Australia’s 0.

  narration: Meanwhile, this part of the Pacific is relatively quiet, with most of
    Australia’s units having been sent to the front. Also visible is Crowfoot making
    good decisions and building naval melee units, with 2 on this slide compared to
    Australia’s 0.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene09.jpg
  narration: Australia’s Chinese beachhead has a serious supply of units, primarily
    Biodrones. Cities on both sides of this war are frequently bombed into the black,
    making city flips a constant inevitability.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene10.jpg
  narration: What was a war front a few parts back between Vietnam and Sibir is now
    relatively quiet, besides the radioactivity on the mountaintops. Apparently the
    major powers are feeling merciful these days and are letting badly out-of-date
    Armenian units leak into their territory.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene11.jpg
  narration: Sibir’s busy elsewhere, flipping Nicaea, at the edge of eastern Europe’s
    citadel pile-up. It’ll definitely flip back, but the technological discrepancy
    between the combatants is on full display here. Sweden’s only able to supply Organic
    Infantry at best, with even weaker Mutants filling in the gaps. Sibir, on the
    other hand, is sending mostly Robot Infantry and BioTroopers, which are endgame
    units.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene12.jpg
  narration: On the other end of the front, Jyvaskyla North and Stalingrad seem secure
    as Kuchum’s troops aim for Linkoping.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene13.jpg
  narration: Tampere falls, as Sibir pushes further and further. Note the horde of
    Siberian workers trailing behind the front, cleaning up pillaged improvements.
    Evidently Kuchum wants these cities online and productive ASAP.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene14.jpg
  narration: Vietnam is struggling on their main front against Australia, but that
    doesn’t mean the Trung Sisters can’t still hit Parkes where it hurts. Their Indian
    Ocean navy has let them nuke the Australian cities of Mowanjum and Kadjina, which
    is mostly symbolic. Notably, the outback looks much thinner on units than it has
    in a long time, showing the toll their war of attrition is taking on them.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene15.jpg
  narration: That Vietnamese army group that massed near Mazar-i-Sharif has failed
    to hold the city, and is instead trying to stall the Boers along the Indus, near
    the ruins of Lashkar Gar. Sri Lanka continues to exist.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene16.jpg
  narration: 'Here’s a view of the nearly-empty core of Sweden. Those Cybersubs won’t
    help you defend against a land invasion, Gustavus. (Bonus: spot the Inuit unit!)'
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene17.jpg
  narration: A rare shot of Iceland’s home island reveals the influence of Big Carrier
    on the nation’s navy. At least there’s a couple of Advanced Destroyers, but not
    many. Still, this North Atlantic Garbage Patch makes the idea of anyone reaching
    Reykjavik infeasible.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene18.jpg
  narration: Apparently Pedro has decided to take Carnival on tour this year, as Brazilian
    units overflow into Icelandic and Boer-held Iberia. But it’s not just Europe…
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene19.jpg
  narration: In fact, the Brazilian military has spilled well into orange Africa,
    as far as Old Kongo. It’s not just a handful of units, either, but a rather substantial
    force.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene20.jpg
  narration: Our spies have given us a report about the pirate haven of Port-au-Prince,
    apparently attempting to build a hotel and rebrand itself as a resort for Inuit
    and Blackfoot tourists. The reviews, however, are less than impressive. “The whole
    place stinks of rum,” wrote one disappointed visitor.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene21.jpg
  narration: Kandahar, on the other hand, has been flipped between Vietnam and the
    Boers down to 3 population. The few survivors are apparently trying to set up
    a marketplace in the basement of the damaged Kremlin.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene22.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian carpet in its natural habitat, demonstrating that South
    America is indeed 100% full, hence the overflow overseas. While the number of
    units is somewhat inflated by out-of-date paratroopers, there’s also substantial
    numbers of endgame-tier units here. Clearly Pedro wants to be taken seriously
    as a military power.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene23.jpg
  narration: The Buccs are hard at work trying to carpet to match, although the shortage
    of land tiles in the Caribbean means their carpet is mostly naval. Though there’s
    still more carriers than are useful, Morgan’s diversified his navy at least a
    little bit. Those poor settlers aren’t likely to find anywhere to settle, though.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene24.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian carpet’s not just leaking to the Old World, but also to
    Inuit North America. The Inuit are apparently struggling to make room for their
    own units, contending with overflow from both Brazil and the Blackfoot. It’s so
    crowded that Brazil’s leaking troops as far north as the Hudson Bay.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene25.jpg
  narration: Icelandic-occupied Germany looks pretty barren. Ingolfur ought to be
    careful not to let his capital-filled territory become an easy target.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene26.jpg
  narration: Boer North Africa is full of optimized tiles, but it’s nearly empty of
    units, other than workers in Old Carthage and Brazilian vacationers.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene27.jpg
  narration: Vietnam flips Tianjin, although it’s not likely to last. Every city here
    looks liable to be flipped a few dozen more times.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene28.jpg
  narration: This Vietnamese fleet won’t be able to do much but harass the ex-Kimberley
    homeland, but the sentiment is there. Rubibi, once Jandamarra’s capital, appears
    to have taken a nuke.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene29.jpg
  narration: 'Kaneohe: beautiful, serene, and peaceful. If you can handle the crowds,
    it’s a lovely vacation spot. Kamehameha would rather stay out of the spotlight
    for his own safety, so let’s move on to the next slide.'
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene30.jpg
  narration: 'And this slide, as it turns out, is the stuff of nightmares for Vietnam
    fans: Hanoi’s in the red, with embarked Aussie melee units in range. Also, despite
    the heavy bombing runs and bordergore, the city still has population of 46, which
    is close to the world’s largest at the moment.'
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Vietnamese troops in the Indus valley have fallen back to Gaur. Kandahar
    is barely being defended, and the flow of Boer troops shows no sign of slowing
    down.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene32.jpg
  narration: Nicaea’s Swedish at the moment, but Siberian reinforcements are coming
    through Gothenburg to flip it. Vaasa also looks quite vulnerable.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene33.jpg
  narration: 'Up to the north, it seems Gustavus has thrown every possible unit at
    the Tampere/Linkoping front as possible. It seems to be holding the line, at least
    for the moment. Also on this slide: look at numbers fielded by the Swedish air
    force!'
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene34.jpg
  narration: Northern Sibir, a bit east from the front, shows Kuchum’s army of workers
    en route. There’s also a new little settlement, Surgut. In-settling is all the
    rage these days.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene35.jpg
  narration: Vaasa flips, and Minsk and Nicaea are extremely open targets. Sweden
    may be holding out at the northern end of the front, but further south it’s a
    lot less stable.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene36.jpg
  narration: The Swedish Organic Infantry are assembling in Old Poland, and Sibir’s
    troops down here seem a tad short-handed. Also, Boer carrier party in the Black
    Sea.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene37.jpg
  narration: A nearly-dead Boer BioTrooper pounds on the gates of Gaur. Vietnam only
    has a handful of units on this front, and they’re not doing much to slow the orange
    onslaught. Kandahar has fallen, handing the Kremlin and Taj Mahal to the Boers.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene38.jpg
  narration: Here’s where those Vietnam fans breathe a sigh of relief that the capital
    has not fallen, nor are there any Australian units in range of doing so at the
    moment. The danger is far from over, though. Still, the Trungs are forcing a battalion
    through to reclaim Vijaya.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene39.jpg
  narration: Blackfoot peacekeepers, leaking from the long-held exclave of Olongapo,
    are starting to fill Australia’s East Indies. Is this going to interfere with
    Parkes’s strategy?
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene40.jpg
  narration: Icelandic St. Louis, on Nova Scotia. Just look at all those specialist
    slots! That’s what Future Worlds is all about.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene41.jpg
  narration: Korean-held Shanghai may not be growing, but it too has substantial infrastructure
    in place. It’s pretty impressive what FW lets one do with a city that has very
    few workable tiles.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene42.jpg
  narration: Vaasa and Tampere flip to Sweden, while Sibir settles Long Xuyen right
    on the battlefield. It’s immediately bombed into the black by Sweden’s air force,
    but it isn’t at risk of flipping at the moment.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene43.jpg
  narration: Viyaja is back in Vietnamese hands, as is Thi Li Bi Nai. As more Vietnamese
    troops approach Panduranga, it’s possible that the whole Cham coast may end up
    in the Trungs’ hands soon. It seems like Parkes sent all his embarked units to
    China instead.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene44.jpg
  narration: 'Ah, the Kimberley Antarctic holdings. With Hanoi taking a bit of a beating,
    Wulungarra might be our new #2 for population (after Porto). If you don’t mind
    absurdly overcrowded islands, snow, and foreign powers sailing ships carrying
    nuclear weapons through your waters, it’s not a bad place to live.'
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene45.jpg
  narration: Looks like Vietnam nuked Middelburg, a Boer city they briefly flipped
    a long while ago. But what’s that I see in the corner…?
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene46.jpg
  narration: That’s right, Sibir and Sweden have made peace! And just as Gustavus
    seemed to have rallied a more substantial army to the front, too. Kuchum conceivably
    could have pushed for more, but I can see why he would stop where he did. He gained
    a capital and a solid vertical stripe of land from Jyvaskyla North to Jyvaskyla
    South.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene47.jpg
  narration: The barren Swedish core. With substantial but non-crippling losses to
    both Iceland and Sibir, Sweden will have to quickly tech up and rebuild if it
    wants to stay relevant.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene48.jpg
  narration: Kuchum’s worker crews are already hard at work cleaning up his new holdings.
    Sibir needs these cities online ASAP if it wants to remain competitive with the
    front-runners.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene49.jpg
  narration: Peace in Europe means little down here in India. Gaur has flipped, and
    the Vietnamese defenders have seemingly surrendered it and retreated to Agra.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene50.jpg
  narration: Panduranga is Vietnamese once again! Kimberley and Blackfoot units immediately
    start to fill the space. The forces near Dong Hoi, Saigon, and Than Hoa seem closer
    to evenly matched than they have in a while.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene51.jpg
  narration: Sweden’s still receiving 500+ GPT from Exclavia, which is probably propping
    up their economy. Kekkonen will only owe it for a few more turns, however.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene52.jpg
  narration: Middelburg is re-nuked. This won’t have much practical effect on the
    Boers, but it’s a big middle finger to Kruger courtesy of the Trungs.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene53.jpg
  narration: Gaur’s last garrison is still in place, but it’s not likely to live much
    longer. Agra’s garrison is also depleted, both by casualties and partial retreat
    to Phu Xuan.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene54.jpg
  narration: I have a hunch Ekeuhnick is planning not to renew his open borders treaties.
    His own troops aren’t able to fill his lands with so many others in the way. At
    least he finally annexed Charlottetown.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene55.jpg
  narration: Blackfoot troops are trying to fill Borneo to peacefully protest Parkes’s
    invasion, but it’s not doing much. Vietnam’s embarked BioTrooper is unlikely to
    ever make it to the island.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene56.jpg
  narration: Tianjin’s in Aussie hands, and a substantial force of Drone Fighters
    out of Rach Gia Airbase are assaulting the Vietnamese forces. I think Australia’s
    short on aluminum and nanomaterials, judging from the terribly out-of-date artillery.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene57.jpg
  narration: Agra has fallen! The city, once the Mughal capital, is another crucial
    prize for Kruger’s orange empire. Phu Xuan has either been nuked or flipped, or
    maybe both.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene58.jpg
  narration: It’s worth remembering that Vietnam also holds the southern end of the
    Indian subcontinent, and these cities are also being heavily bombarded by the
    Boers. A single Boer Robot Infantry has landed near Trincomalee, but Vietnamese
    forces are there to flip it if need be.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: Image 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene59.jpg
  narration: Autocracy is voted world ideology, which is unsurprising giving its omnipresence
    in domination AI games.
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: Image 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene60.jpg
  narration: Ingolfur’s weakened military and scoreboard of capitals have attracted
    Kruger’s attention, and plans are at least being considered by Skynet’s algorithms.
    The main obstacle right now looks to be Brazilian vacationers, who have reached
    as far as Paris.
- scene_number: "61"
  scene_title: Image 61
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene61.jpg
  narration: Brazilian units have started to fill the outback too. Parkes’s carpet
    certainly has a lot more holes than it used to, further proving how much of his
    resources have been committed to the war effort.
- scene_number: "62"
  scene_title: Image 62
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene62.jpg
  narration: Gustavus Adolphus, in his temper, throws darts at a board of potential
    military targets for Sweden’s big comeback. He hasn’t updated it in a while, though,
    and Texas is just a Lone Star Battleship at this point. (Also, spot the moai!)
- scene_number: "63"
  scene_title: Image 63
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene63.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka continues to not want to be seen, building units capable of
    hiding underwater. Parakramabahu just wants to survive to the end, under the radar.
    And honestly, I can’t blame him.
- scene_number: "64"
  scene_title: Image 64
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene64.jpg
  narration: Blackfoot Honolulu’s building Paratroopers. Of note is the fact that
    the Blackfoot have the tech for some futuristic units like BioTroopers, but seem
    to be building a lot of cheaper, older units anyway.
- scene_number: "65"
  scene_title: Image 65
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene65.jpg
  narration: Phu Xuan has flipped again, and the remaining Vietnamese forces in the
    area are scattered and weak. The Boer presence in the area is a bit lacking, too,
    but they should have the region on lockdown.
- scene_number: "66"
  scene_title: Image 66
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene66.jpg
  narration: Trincomalee did indeed flip, but the nearest Boer melee unit in this
    shot is all the way in Basra, meaning further damage to the area is unlikely for
    the moment.
- scene_number: "67"
  scene_title: Image 67
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene67.jpg
  narration: Tianjin is Vietnamese once again, and the Australian presence looks a
    little thin. Is Crowfoot and Jandamarra’s interference paying off? Than Hoa even
    looks flippable.
- scene_number: "68"
  scene_title: Image 68
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene68.jpg
  narration: Parkes isn’t giving up, though, and manages to squeeze enough units through
    to flip the Cham coast again. Vietnamese troops are already en route to flip them
    back.
- scene_number: "69"
  scene_title: Image 69
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part97-scene69.jpg
  narration: 'No, this isn’t the end of the episode, and no, your eyes aren’t lying
    to you. That is indeed Brazil topping the military charts, substantially ahead
    of the usual front-runners. Clearly Pedro’s plan to carpet everywhere that will
    give him open borders is paying off in spades, and his military capabilities are
    quite intimidating. The question then becomes: what is Pedro planning on using
    his military for?'

  narration: 'A scorched pile of rubble is all that’s left of Kandahar, once home
    of two world wonders. The Kremlin, the Taj Mahal, and thousands of years of history
    are destroyed in a nuclear strike. It looks as though the Trungs have taken a
    page from Henry Morgan’s playbook: against an enemy as powerful the Boers, scorched
    earth tactics may be the only thing that can slow them down.'

  narration: For every city destroyed, though, a new one can be built. The Boers have
    established Silkokitsimik on the Horn of Africa, and it’s likely that the new
    holes in the map will be filled before long. Today, the Indus valley may be scarred
    by radiation and death, but someday, it will be rebuilt.

  narration: A look at the religion stats shows how rapidly Arianism and Catholicism
    have spread. Leonidas XIV “Mallock” cries from beyond the grave at Dodekatheism‘s
