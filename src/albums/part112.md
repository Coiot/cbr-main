  narration: |-
    Hey has anyone heard of that cool superhero movie coming soon yeah here’s some cool oc based on that, isn’t it cool? good work /u/Lutoures, it’s very cool. i like how brazil is the big guy in the background. is that the protagonist or antagonist of the movie? Very cool.
    Another week, another exciting episode of mass genocide on a cylindrical scale. This time, I, /u/DanielTheFinn (not that anyone ever cares who the narrator is), will be guiding you through the terrifying mess, or at least try to guide you. Well, I can’t complain as I’d rather have crazy total war than 50 slides of Sibir and Vietnam flipping the same cities over and over again. Something like that won’t happen in this part, right? R-right?
    I have two absolutely terrible AARs under my belt, so I guarantee you that the narration for this part will be of superior quality. I’d provide you links to these AARs, but I’m not sure the contract I signed allows me to shill my older works. It did say that Reon will own my soul for the rest of eternity. Anyways, I’m just not gonna risk it, in case I lose my opportunity to narrate one of my favourite AARs on the net.

    UNFADE THE FLAIRS
    The highlight of the last part (aside from the whole boring total war thing) was definitely the unexpected and inexplicable revival of Japan and the Philippines by the Blackfoot. Well, for you people, at least. I’m sure I’d be excited too if I hadn’t started following CBR a while after Philippines and Japan ceased to be relevant. And, you know, if the two civs wouldn‘t get conquered within a turn. Which will happen. I haven’t even looked at the slides yet but I know I’m right.
    Everyone declares war on the two leaders that have returned from the dead. Maybe they‘re afraid of zombies.
    Note how Gladstone is the Blackfoot capital.

    Hey look, Australia and Vietnam are fighting in Indonesia! I am sure this won‘t turn into a pointless meatgrinder where the same cities are flipped over and over again! Because that sure has never happened before in this region!
    Although to be honest, ‘Straya does have a lot of decent infantry, while Vietnam has boats with guns. So maybe my fears are unfounded.

    a mistake. Thanks Limerick!\nInuit is not out of the game yet, bitches. Ekeuhnick
    will carve a snake and survive until only they and Brazil remain, so they can
    at least finish in the second place. \nAlso how the heck does Mongolia still hold

    Just a little further south Australia has taken Tabriz from Mongolia. This total war sure is creating a lot of bordergore... if only Kekkonen was here to enjoy it. ;c
    Vietnam is mostly empty, which is not a good sign. At least they have decent forces on their borders, but I wonder how long they will last against Sibir, who seems to have the upper hand in Northern Asia.

    Vietnamese legions of biotroopers and robots desperately fight Brazilian paratrooper corps and XCOM squads in the Bengalese swamps. That‘s a sentence that has never been said before in the history of humankind. CBR is full of this kind of nonsense, which is one of the many reasons why I love it.
    While the two sisters might retake Lahore and Goatse I mean Gyantse, Brazil will very likely take them back instantly with their larger and more mobile army, and might snipe a few cities behind the frontline as well. Resistance is futile, Trung sisters. Just bend over and let Pedro give you both a brazilian wax.

  narration: "'Who will take it?' Well fucking guess who just did, last week‘s narrator.\nBrazil
    takes Wulungarra from Straya and makes the Boer penguins quack nervously. Both
    green hordes are sending in reinforcements to secure the island and the nearby
    Boer colonies. \nA trio of Buccaneer Carriers bump into Boer ships, their drunk
    crewmen flinging insults at the biomechanical penguins. It‘s not very effective.
    Also, the buccaneer great musician is nowhere to be seen. Press ARRR to pay respects.\nCan
    carriers attack great admirals, by the way? That‘s obviously something I‘ve never
    had to ask when playing Civ 5, because I don‘t put carriers in my frontline like
    some moron."

  narration: "Sibir, alongside with Australia, is the only real 'threat' to Brazil,
    and I put the word in quotation marks. Even they don‘t have enough military might
    to do more than slow down the CARNAVAL. \nYerevan, Yervantashat, Ghazni and Carrollton
    are in the black and South Jyväskylä (hey that‘s named after my home town neat)
    has been captured. Sibir robots are the only thing preventing Brazil from gaining
    a yet another capital, and their numbers have thinned considerably since the last
    part. \nNothing can stop the CARNAVAL. HUEHUEHUEHUEHUE"

    this with a slide from last part and you couldn‘t tell the difference. Okay fine
    there might be a few more Brazilian soldiers but honestly it‘s not like anyone
    bothers to count them. There‘s simply too dang many of them.

    that‘d be scary if I wasn‘t used to this by now (thanks to the internet, I say that about a lot of things)
    EXCEPT ROME STILL STANDS PROUD! BRAVE VIKING ROBOTS OF ICELAND, HOLD YOUR GROUND AND DEFEND THE CITY UNTIL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU HAS FALLEN! THOR IS WATCHING!

    The CARNAVAL has arrived in the streets of Paris! It didn‘t take long for almost everything here to get conquered by Brazil. Poor leader of Iceland whose name I have forgotten.
    The year is 5461 AD. France is entirely occupied by the Brazilians. Well, not entirely... One small city of indomitable Icelanders still holds out against the invaders. And life is not easy for the XCOM soldiers who garrison the fortified camps surrounding the city...
    okay fine Orleans is there too but York is almost exactly where the canonical location of the village is! how could i not make that reference?

  narration: Meanwhile in the South, Brazil‘s progress in Western Africa is the complete
    opposite of their progress in Western Europe. By that I mean there hasn‘t been
    any progress here at all, really. Either Buccs and Icelanders have bravely fought
    to defend the lands they took centuries ago or Brazil is just lazy. I‘m inclined
    to believe the latter to be true.

    hey look, absolutely nothing has happened here. wow.
    I‘m sure Brazil will have fun conquering the Isles of Cancer, as I like to call them. Look at all those mountains and icebergs and one-tile wide passages. And there‘s a citadel there, too. Maybe for once Brazil will be slowed down.

    Poor Inuit. They‘ve been my second favourite civ since I started following CBR. It was fun watching them slowly creep southward, spreading winter everywhere and slaughtering foolish warmbloods who stood in their way. But alas, all good things must come to an end.
    I wrote that because there‘s nothing else to write because nothing has fucking happened here either
    OH WAIT, NO, I HAVE SPOTTED SOMETHING! Brazil took Cuiaba back from Iceland.
    That‘s all.

    Ekeuhnick: Fuck you Pedro, do you know how fucking hard it was to take these lands from Canada? Constant artillery bombardment, constant flipping, constant naval landings, the war lasted for ages before we finally triumphed. We earned these lands. Now you just waltz in and take it all without breaking a sweat. Fuck you, man.
    Pedro: I don‘t waltz in, I samba in. HUEHUEHUEHUE

  narration: |-
    Oh yeah Ivvavik fell. Apparently that‘s not important according to the narrator of the last part, who doesn’t even know what the Inuit capital is. That just shows the poor quality of Brazilian education!
    Ivvavik, one of the few cities on the cylinder that had never been occupied by a foreign invader, home to several wonders. Now in filthy Brazilian hands.
    God dammit. Why do all the things I love fall apart?
    AHEM anyways, Ekeuhnick, his military commanders and his government have all fled across the mountains to the relative safety of Tunnuo. The Ice Sheet Fleet, which was declared useless long ago, suddenly becomes useful. They are the last hope of the Inuit.
    which ships are melee ships? Please tell me there‘s many of them. PLEASE I BEG YOU

    Australian carriers form a wall around Honolulu to prevent it from falling again. Or maybe they‘re protecting Hawaii? Nah, I‘m 99% sure Parker already annexed Kamehameha‘s ass. FADE THE FLAIR
    I ‘member rooting for Brazil long ago. Back then, I hoped they could keep the Australian garbage patch at bay and drive the digger invaders away from their continent. Maybe one day they would even finally conquer the Buccs and have a showdown with the Inuit. Then the winner, now the sole ruler of the Americas, would become a worthy rival for the Boers. Oh, I ‘member.
    Those were good times.

    Almost all of Mexicarrr has fallen, the Nassau Canal has been taken, Huamanga has been conquered and half the buccaneer military seems to be gone. But somehow, Leogane, Georgetown and Parana have not been occupied. In fact, Parana even recovered a little.
    But now the Better Portuguese turn their attention to these cities. Everyone by now knows how it will go. No one is going to call /u/ jprivado a prophet for predicting that these cities would fall within 2-3 parts.

    Palenque and Port-Au-Prince hold for now, but there are fewer defenders than before and more attackers. Palenque will fall next turn, but Port-Au-Prince might hold out a little longer thanks to all those mountains and carriers. But it is all in vain, for ultimately all will be vomit green.
    Why vomit green? Why didn‘t some other, heck, any other civilization overthrow the Boers? Why did the Boers lose at all? I‘d rather have diarrhea orange than vomit green covering the whole map, to be honest.
    wait hold on holy shit since when has Port Royal had 50 population

  narration: "Computer processors coldly calculate millions of painful and horrifying
    deaths all across the cylinder. For hours, they labour. More and more soldiers
    join the Brazilian military and are armed to the teeth. More and more soldiers
    from other nations die in droves. Civilians starve in besieged cities, perish
    in brutal urban assaults or flee to the countryside en masse, where the computer
    cannot reach them. But even there, they cannot find peace as soldiers clash with
    each other and pillage what they can.\nThe computer cares not. It simply calculates,
    switches zeroes and ones, translates the data and finally presents it to its masters.
    \nTen years have passed on the cylinder, while roughly 35 hours have passed in
    the real world. The grim calculations are finally complete. The next turn has
    arrived.\nTime to resupply my popcorn container!"

    Ivvavik is retaken, then taken again. The frozen capital of the once mighty Inuit has turned into a ghost town. Yet the Inuit do not give up. Surrender is not an option.
    Inuit to winuit... I remember thinking that when the Inuit swiftly conquered the Blackfoot. But then they got a taste of their own medicine.

    Well, almost. But the Inuit refuse to be swiftly conquered and throw all they have at the southerners. Brazil‘s victory may be inevitable, but the more coffins the bastards have to take back home, the better. They must pay for every meter they take with a liter of warm blood.

  narration: |-
    As I predicted, Palenque and Parana have fallen. But what I didn‘t predict was the Buccs taking back Maracaibo and Chicken Pizza, as well as Leogane and Georgetown remaining in their hands. They do have a lot of boats here, even if many of them are carriers. Brazil lacks ranged units and ships of their own, so the Buccaneers have an advantage.
    But even then they can only prolong the inevitable.

    just coming from another direction. \nCartagena falls and Nevis is besieged and
    blockaded. Carriers sink all the time. Port Royal starves and hundreds of thousands
    die every year. It‘s not looking good for the pirates."

    The soldiers defending York have some amazing new liquid substance which gives them astonishing strength and speed. Two of the soldiers, a short and clever biotrooper with a winged helmet and his tall and big-boned companion, have become heroes of the city and icons of resistance. Brazilians are driven back and are baffled by this unexpected defeat. Emperor Pedro will not be pleased.
    Iceland‘s navy is about 50% carriers (no I‘m not gonna calculate the exact percentage), but the rest are somewhat useful ships. They might be able to flip coastal cities for quite a long time.

  narration: |-
    Perhaps here, on the Eastern Front? Long Xuyen, a Sibir salient, has fallen, as have the cities of Nedong and Tashkent.
    Judging by how few citizens flee when Brazilians capture a city, most of them welcome their new overlords. Perhaps that is because Pedro offers something no other leader on the cylinder does: eternal world peace, order and progress, and endless carnivals with almost completely naked women.
    That doesn‘t sound that bad, actually. Maybe Brazilians are the good guys, after all?

    and Ghazni. Only Carrollton holds. The Caucasus is almost completely secured and
    Pedro has a yet another fine addition to his collection of capital cities. Further
    east, Sibir does its best to hold Kabul and Nishapur. These mountain passes are
    the gates which prevent the vomit green flood from spewing out onto the flat deserts
    beyond. Or, well, they would be gates if the Brazilian army wasn‘t full of paratroopers
    and XCOMs.'

    here have vanished. I mean who the hell am I kidding, their soldiers fucking died
    in droves in the bloody marshes of Bengal. \nElsewhere, Peshawar falls and Brazilians
    drop soldiers close to enemy cities. Slowly but surely, the green tide advances.
    \nBeyond the front, the Vietnamese lands still lie empty. A few scattered regiments
    garrison cities and that‘s it. Don’t worry Vietnam fans, I’m sure everything will
    be fine."

    Karakorum is surrounded. It is one of the three remaining Mongol cities. Legions of Sibir biotroopers close in on the city, which is defended by a single tank-thing unit and a caravan. Genghis Khan has two options: flee or die. Or, well, leaders can‘t die until all their cities fall, so he actually has only one option: flee to one of his other cities if Sibir attacks.
    Will Kuchum grant Genghis a warrior‘s death by taking Karakorum last? I doubt it.
    Vietnam and Sibir give me flashbacks of the eternal meatgrinder. the word 'Bamda' makes me shudder.

    Another turn, more death. Not only has Australia secured the Philippines, but the Japanese isles and the women and the children too. Also, someone nuked Nagoya before or after it fell. Yep.
    I hope none of you silly idiots placed Japan and the Philippines high in the rankings. Also, I think the Blackfoot died with their zombies. FADE ALL THE FLAIRS
    Ironic. Crowfoot could save others from death, but not himself.
    Meanwhile Brazil has summoned a big army out of nowhere and is now conquering almost completely defenceless Vietnam.
    I guess I should mention this too, even if it has no effect on the game whatsoever: The world votes to repeal cultural heritage sites. I guess they are indeed kinda pointless now, as most cultural sites have been utterly raped by war.

    You might notice in the upper left corner that Khonuu is the new capital of the Mongol empire. Genghis Khan had no option but to shamefully flee his capital and first city. Looks like Kuchum was not merciful.
    Pyongyang has been captured by Australians and the Korean army continues to exist elsewhere. Parkes has taken advantage of this absence and carved a nice enclave here.

  narration: "The Brazilians have reached the Roof of the World. Pedro visits it in
    person, looks down at the world around him and proclaims 'All this shall be coloured
    vomit green on the map. It‘s my favourite colour because I have shit taste.'\nThat
    was not propaganda, I swear. He actually said that. \nIn other, less fake news,
    Nishapur has fallen and Senggezangbo (say that ten times fast Dawkinzz) is surrounded.
    It has a sizeable number of airplanes garrisoning it, which the AI will surely
    pull out before the city falls, because the AI is smart."

  narration: The infamous meatgrinder will not happen again, simply because Vietnam
    doesn‘t have that many units at all here. The Sibir have penetrated the mountain
    passes and now invade the almost completely defenceless cities in the Tarim basin.
    Nyingchi falls and Nagchuka is soon to follow.

    Karakorum has indeed fallen, as has Tomtor. Khonuu is the last remaining Mongolian city, and already half of its garrison is dead or wounded. Now that Genghis has been humiliated, Kuchum is happy to finish him off and gives his soldiers a simple order:
    'Bring me his head.'

    Carrolton holds, as does the rest of the Sibir-Brazil front. Brazilians seem to lack units here, unlike the Sibir who have a neat carpet not only near the front but further away from their borders as well. It’s looking good for them, for now.
    I‘d become a Sibir supporter if I didn‘t fear that they‘ll meet the same fate as the Inuit did.

    The city of Icelanders with superpowers remains free. But just like the village in the comics likely fell to the Romans eventually, so will York, as its defenders lie dead. Pedro‘s top scientists created a similar drug and gave it to their soldiers, who defeated the brave Gauls I mean Icelanders. The sky is about to fall on top of their heads.
    (I do find it quite funny that the region of real-world Brittany is holding out against the Brazilians so well, considering that I played as the Duchy of Brittany in my last AAR)

    Speaking of the Buccs, let’s check how they’re doing!
    Nevis is surprisingly the only city to fall here. The mountains around Port-Au-Prince, Leogane and Georgetown are certainly making it hard for the Brazilians to advance, not to mention the naval support which also keeps Maracaibo and Chicken Pizza secure.
    But the Brazilians are relentless. Already more than half of the world is coloured in Pedro‘s favourite color. Why should they stop? It‘s not like they‘ll ever run out of young men, machines and bioengineered supersoldiers to throw at the enemy.

    hold. Pedro is annoyed, because he’s used to his forces easily overwhelming the
    enemy with sheer numbers and superior tactics. What‘s the problem now? Is it the
    hostile climate, radically different from the tropical heat of Brasilia?

    Mini-Pedro and Pedro are not stupid. They simply choose a target region, conquer it with maximum efficiency, and then move on to the next one. First, Icelandic France. Then, Africarr. Now, Icelandic Africa.
    The world is just a list of regions to be assimilated, in order. Nothing shall stand in the way of efficient progress.

    Well, except the tenacious city of York. The Brazilian legions have assembled around the city and are ready to attack for the last time, their abilities enhanced by Emperor Pedro‘s super-strength serum. But the ancient city gates are flung open and a host of Icelanders come forth, swinging their fists and running straight towards them. They are led by the two heroes.
    The final battle of York begins.

    The Brazilians are adaptable. They can deploy anywhere in the world like Finnish paratroopers. They can crush the enemy with an overwhelming number of advanced units like the Boer. They can advance slowly but with the strong determination of a glacier like the Inuit, like they are doing here. Perhaps this adaptability is their recipe to success.
    Of course, their list of tactics and strategies does not include Henry Parkes‘ 'Disappoint your supporters by never accomplishing anything meaningful despite all your great potential.”

    Kabul has fallen. Hrazdan has fallen. Carrolton has fallen. Morelia has fallen.
    Kuchum Khan does not understand. He‘s doing everything right. He builds many good-quality units in his highly productive cities and sends them to the front. He uses airplanes to weaken enemy cities and overwhelming numbers to capture them. But he‘s losing, losing one city after another. Why is he losing? What is he supposed to do? Is there anything he can do?

    Just as Sibir robots are about to capture Khost, a squad of trollish Brazilian XCOMs lands in the city and takes it from Vietnam.
    Surprisingly, Senggezangbo (say that ten times again, Dawkinzz, this time make it into a song) has not fallen and its airfield remains fully operational. But further north, Lhasa is being bombarded and surrounded.
    The tibetans will not welcome Brazilians as liberators. To them, the green men are just the pawns of a yet another bloodthirsty autocrat. But perhaps the tibetans will be allowed to have a democratic puppet state for a while? So what, they think, because Pedro will ultimately annex them to his Global Empire anyways. Apathy reigns in Lhasa.
