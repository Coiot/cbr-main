  narration: "<p>Hey there everyone, LunarNeedle here! Resident testman, professional leaker and bug tester for Blue Cassette here with another hella exciting episode. I’m hella glad to be a narrator again and I hope you’ll have just as much fun as I do. Remember; I know the answers, but like any good roleplayer. I’m good at playing dumb. Queue the “you’re playing dumb?” comments now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We’ll start with OC produced by Staunch_Boat_Mormon showing blatantly Venice propaganda. Like cmon, Dandolo definitely doesn’t have muscles that big. We all know big boi Frederic will gladly size up those muscles with his impressive muscles he’s labelled ‘flintlocks’. Oh yeah, and this image is hilarious. I wonder if these two will team up again in the future to prove which power can dominate Europe and contain the eldritch menace from South America.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Instead of the war map; which is insanely useful. I’m opting to highlight a returning maximum extent styled map by /u/thehonestyfish. This specific one highlights our largest upset of the Royale. Songhai truly spread their arms all over Libyan lands and controlled most of north-west Africa before collapsing. Was an awful time to be a Songhai fan; but amazing if you are participating in the prediction contest. I recieved like 12 points over two parts. Nice.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Alright guys, here is your mandated Uruguay fear campaign. Uruguay is definitely the big South American nightmare of this generation, and it’s hard not to see why. With most of their competitors reluctant to expand due to territory be it mountains, jungle or Haiti; Uruguay has been allowed to expand and thrive. That matched with one of the best AIs in history; possessing incredibly high expansion bias with sufficient naval biases to allow them to cross the south Atlantic ocean for a chunk of modern day Ghana is impressive and very scary. Adding onto that, they also have a seven tech advantage over Shikoku; effectively giving them an era advantage over their opponent. At this point, it’d take a coalition of Civs at the end of the tech tree to dent the Uruguay menace. Be afraid.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin this episode with units crashing into a rapidly dwindling Qing front. Shikoku was unable to advance due to a blob of units filling every tile in the Qing lands not three parts ago. However, now it seems like a round trip to the Qing city of Yin from Yongchen looks like a safe ride. Not one speck of damage crosses the cities though, so maybe Ying Zheng is viewing it personally before it becomes another production center for the purple patriarch of punishment.</p><p></p><p>In the notification panel we see some interesting notifications. The first is an ideology being founded; however even as Blue Cassette it’s a bit difficult to save load at the moment. The second I get access however I will post an update on Reddit. The second notification though I don’t need to save load to find out, and that is that Venice will peace out with the Holy Roman Empire; leaving them to Ulm in the arctic and Brno in the ruins of the Czech empire.</p>"

  scene_title: "Huexotzinco Occupied?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uruguay cannot help but to extend its control over central America; potentially grinding the war to a stalemate by, somehow, having an anti-air gun parked right inside of Huexotzinco to encourage Venezuela to stop fighting; which seems to work. Don’t tell the navy about it though, they really don’t like to stop fighting. That does make me wonder though, exactly how did the unit get in there, and does that make the city invincible to being captured without declaring war on Uruguay. A war declaration against Uruguay is a decision no one wants to make, even if there’s a 781 defense Kuikuro in between them and the big blue blob.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Haida throws down the gauntlet and says that Siberia is not enough and that they are the rightful owner of the Qing’s colonies. I like to believe the Khamug’s are spreading dissonance in the Qing’s empire to stir their apathetic leaders into a warlust; only to find their disturbance greatly benefits the opportunistic leaders on the North American west coast. This coast has little in the way of avenues of power; and would require total exhaustion of the soldiers around Wuchang and Changsa for any progress to be made. With a war on two sides; it’s unlikely that they will be able to defend both their northern cities and their flank. Exciting times folks!</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>This is looking to be a helluva part. Oh, those wars? No, those are irrelevant. What is interesting is that modern Madagascan naval troops are slowly thinning out Beta Israel’s impressive and out of date navy. In fact, they’re thinning it out so much that divisions of the army have deployed on the water to be some assistance. It’s a futile effort; and with each unit sunk it’s only a matter of time until… well, most likely a anti-climatic peace deal, let’s be honest.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a move no one saw coming; not even the people who analyzed the bonus slide we accidentally included in the part; or the momentary pictures in the DC; no one saw this at all. Indeed, it is so. That’s it for Papua. They fought their hardest, and despite the warmongering penalties, New Zealand declared that this was their stand, and with a valiant strike; they blitzed Bunbury and Hohodae down. These cities, destroyed by war will not amount to much in the end of the game, but will mean the end of a fighter unlike any other.Papua, led by Rajapapua, was a powerful nation that came out of nowhere. An early settle by Sulu was thought to be the end, but they fought hard and took every opportunity, scoring most of north east Australia before being the linchpin into the death of Sulu mere parts ago. They will not be remembered as the nation who won, but they will be a stark reminder to never count someone out so early. The game can and will flip in and in this case out of your favor as the very friends who defended you either died in the case of Murri; or murdered both of you in the case of New Zealand. I salute to you, my friend.Eff.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ostrava is almost down for the count as two suspiciously similarly colored neighbours get all too close with each other. If the HRE declared war right now; the city would be in their hands, but for now they watch as Ostrava eventually becomes Palmyrene. In other news; Venice has Rifleman in troves now. They’re becoming quite a super power. Could they finally fix the border gore that plagues Europe?  </p>"

  scene_title: "Ulm… what?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Remember when people weren’t blaming the latest Holy Roman Empire leader on being incompetent and that the new leader was given a crap posistion? Well,they just gave away their beautiful Greenland city away to a civilization who would never be able to take their last city; leaving the once proud empire to one random city they, funnily enough, stole in a random peace deal unjustly. Actually, nevermind about them being incompetent. They’re just paying their karma dues before being ejected to the sub.</p><p>In other news; Al-mariyyah is definitely inundated with a bit of a pirate problem; as privateers line the icy paradise. It’s also a big paradise; with more population than some of the big cities I get in multiplayer games. You go get ‘em!</p>"

  scene_title: "Basically Canada IRL."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Metis might be improving slightly as their unit, the Coureur des Bois have arrived. This unique unit replaces the Musketman. Starts with the amphibious promotion, ignores terrain cost and receives +15% Combat Strength when starting outside friendly territory which when fighting a defensive war is pretty mediocre other then flipping one of their own cities, which is never an envious situation. Thankfully, the unit also receives +1 Movement and +15% Defense when starting alongside a river; which not as relevant to their arctic colonies is still a nice enough buff. Here’s hoping Metis can recover and use this unit to bounce back.</p><p>In war news; it seems that units are beginning to fill the ocean around North Canada and have begun to assist the front around Mackinac. The Yup’ik might be running out of steam as the Metis unique unit clashes with Yup’ik swordsman and artillery around Fort Pitt.</p>"

  scene_title: "About that..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Apache is bringing more than enough heat to sink any nation. With Enlightenment Era units rampaging through the countryside knocking on Battleford and using the staging ground of the Iroquois territory as a basin to funnel their units deeper into the core. It seems more so with each and every turn the mega-empires of North America grow in size. </p><p>One could hope the friendship doesn’t lead to a Brazil styled military take over of Iroqouis. Don’t do that to my boys. They killed my Civ; they have to be worth respecting. Haha, I implied Canada was a bar that was hard to pass. I’m sad now.</p>"

  scene_title: "Truckin’ to Moscow"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Prussian unique units are filling out the territory of a surprisingly historically accurate Imperial Germany. Likewise to history, Moscow proves to be a road too far as no Civilization appears to be interested in accumulating the warmongering penalties. Elsewhere in this shot; Edirne looks pitifully defended and could be assimilated by Prussia posthaste. Meanwhile; the Goths are surprisingly strong in the navy and weak in the army; a unique look for them to be sure. The only thing I want to see is for Ostrava to fall. Like, the joke has run its course.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Submarines; competent armies; medium amounts of units and trading with India; another day in Japan for Shikoku. Happy of his Korean conquests, Shikoku might fancy themselves another feast; but their gaze turns to Qin and promptly says, “No thanks.”</p>"

  scene_title: "Oh; oh god."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Maybe the navy bug has spread; as Civs with woefully low naval bias continue to build more and more boats and less and less troops. Perhaps there’s an enrollment issue; perhaps the populace after dealing with Canada and subduing Poverty Point have become complacent. Still, I could imagine Haiti disappearing with this navy; something I definitely wouldn’t say five parts ago.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The logs of justice were planted on the terrain; erecting more barriers for their neighbours; but they failed to add in units to defend the newly acquired Songhai capital and new gains. Nevertheless; they are still a threat and could equalize Africa given enough time.</p>"

  scene_title: "Can Eldritch Feel Fear?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Cascos Azules have touched ground; the unique Paratrooper replacement seen last part that can enter foreign territory without open borders; have 15% combat strength when outside Uruguayan lands. They costs 20% more to build at first, but cities gain +1% production towards Cascos Azules for every unit in the territory of another civilization whom they are not at war with up to 40%; making them roughly 20% cheaper to build. Thankfully; we added a resource cost of Aluminum to keep them from owning the entire map; but this unit can and will shut down opponents before sucking them dry. Dare I say, the Selk’nam have been made into a cute puppet so the real eldritch horror can spread terror from the inside. Good luck Kuikuro; is what I’m saying.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Welcome to the smackdown! In this corner; weighing a lot of units with a surprising navy and a thirst for blood, it’s Iroquois! In the other corner; with a chip on their shoulder and enemies on all sides; it’s the fighter, the one to top them all, the center of the rumble. It’s Apache!This is huge for the entire Royale; as this could potentially result in major border shifts in favor of Metis; potentially weaken the complacent armies of both and turn the American scene into one of blood and carnage. Frankly, I can’t wait.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Ring"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shis-Inday was the first city brought down heavily on this front as Iroquois were definitely prepare for this strike. Levering gunfire from their field guns and cannons; siege weaponry from the Enlightenment Era, it’s likely many cities will get low. However without the many melee units to back them up; I have some doubt that Iroquois offense will bear fruit. Only time will tell.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With armies crashing down on the city of Aoluguya, it seems unlikely that Evenks will make any gains; already losing Yakesa to the blue wave across Siberia. I do; however see little momentum to push past Vanavara unless they really bleed units across their entire empire. Meanwhile; the Khamugs’ watch with popcorn in hand. Come on guys; do the thing!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tripoli was such a powerful city back in the day; now reduced to a shell of what it was as it has acquired new management. The powerful Great Galleass looks onwards towards what could’ve been a much more beautiful color half a dozen parts ago. It’s a wonder what would ignite this front again; and who would come out on top. I’ll be frank; it won’t go far; but Venice will still somehow lose.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A Venezuelan gunner points to a siege weapon operator just south west of Maracay; dust grained into his skin as he reached for a revolver. He felt sweat beading down his skin. But before they could fire at each other; a loud test shot was fired in the sky from a nearby Uruguyan anti-air artillery. With a crack, they both look at each other and sigh. The siege operator just laughs, “You still think they’re smart by just bringing siege weapons to a war?”Roleplay aside, holy hell is Uruguay stopping this war just as much as Venezuela doesn’t want to win. I don’t know if anything will come of this war with both peace keeping units and a negligent amount of melee units.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shikoku; New Zealand and Taungoo are all next to each other before Modern Era; get that on paper. Also Selk’nam are there helping with cleanup. Good eldritch horror.For real; these cities are going to be Taungoo’s chance to become a major power. Meanwhile I have large fear the Shikokan cities are just going to be pawns to be sacrificed for the sake of their main island should Taungoo get big enough to threaten the mainland. But hey; it looks cool.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Where did you come from?! Just like that; an outdated army runs the frontline. Sure, there’s a Pikeman staring down a rifleman; and sure the cities are definitely not the bigger of the area; but dang was that impressive. Yin is still slightly undefended; but it seems they might hold through sheer production and tenacity itself. Impressive.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hallelujah"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ostrava has fallen and with it, the sanity of map makers as they look at the borders of these two empires. Meanwhile Czech life is now looking great as Venician and Viking units fight side by side against Prague; although none seem to dent the small wall of units; as if afraid that touching the city will make their AI worse. HRE got infected clearly; giving away Ulm in a peace deal. Maybe they need sterilized gloves?The Palmyrene Empire looks to be one of legends; almost reforming the better Rome. There, I said it. I would mic drop; but I’m not talking, Dawkinzz is. Sad.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Oh..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now I see why Iroquois declared war! Holy heck, are the Apache a split up and weak nation, all things said and done. It seems unlikely that Chuuk’anen and Shis-inday will hold, although I expect many flips for the later due to the army in the area.</p>"

  scene_title: "Carriers Are Coming"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Remember when I wanted to reduce carrier priorities? Well, good news, I’m pretty sure we did based on late-game screenshots; but it still doesn’t stop the husks of metal floating in the modern era. Just put that in your mind that Uruguay have carriers and paratroopers at turn 369 on historic speed. They are nightmare fuel and seemingly getting more powerful. The only benefit is that I imagine they are trade happy; allowing any neighbour to leach up to 20+ science from trade routes; which definitely softens up the blow. Most likely due to this, Haiti has Rifleman; which is a feat unto itself. Nice job Haiti.</p>"

  scene_title: "Colonial Technology"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>It almost seems like they are in a unique world; as most Civs are beginning to field more advanced ships in Europe and beyond; privateers and other units seem to be content on floating around in the water,effectively a dinghy in the time of flight and atomic bombs. It’s possible Uruguay can; with a key war; unlock their units to fight on the mainland; potentially in a coalition against Uruguay. But that’s for the future. For now; any plans on the old world will be put on hold until the Modern Armors arrive in like... two parts.</p>"

  scene_title: "Nothing To See Here?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Upon looking at this image; you might think, “Wow; there’s not much here.” and you’d be right; so let’s delve deeper. Uruguay seem to be friendly with Zimbabwe; meaning these giants should be safe for some parts. They are also fielding a small amount of modern infantry near Kindonga, the final stand of Nzinga. The most important part of the picture; is the friendliness of Zimbabwe; and the weak amount of army here. With a few thousand units; they can definitely be a horror; but like the Boer’s before them; a new infantry unit might be not worth it compared to the new shiny Research Lab.</p>"

  scene_title: "Navy Bug"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Much like the carrier bug; it seems that if given the option to build useless boats; the AI would much rather do that then leave their core exposed. The Sami need to use their insane production in filling their lands or they’ll… well, nothing will happen. What do you think; the Goths would do some fighting? Pfft, no.</p>"

  scene_title: "Will it fall? Prague-ly."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The units slowly shift into position as the Great Hot Potato game of 3090AD commences. For my sanity; if the Rifleman north of Prague dies; it’ll most likely be a fifty fifty flip. So this front will be interesting to watch. Personally; I would give it to Venice; as it would make future Prussian wars interesting and give them a way to eliminate HRE; making every map maker 44% happier. Don’t ask where I got the percentage. Classified information.</p>"

  scene_title: "What?!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uh; so yeah. Madagascan Arabia might become a thing; and considering Palmyra are running Crossbowman while Madagascar have their unique unit; I doubt it’ll be as one sided as we think. I still give it to Palmyra due to the army size; but damn Madagascar. You do you.</p>"

The rest of the city’s name is classified.</p><p></p><p>In other words; the Yup’ik escaped with most of their cities they captured; allowing the Metis to focus the armies to the south and to the east.

He was so angered; he found a pointy stick and waved it around. He was then murdered by the Viking army and given a dishonorable burial shortly later. RIP.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh; oh god. Aside from the absence of melee units; the sheer wall of Enlightenment Era ranged units will make a mockery of the southern front. It seems like a straight shot from here all the way to the Apache capital at this point. It’s about time you become an expert negotiator Geronimo.</p>"

Minos watches from his personal scout boat with a chuckle. He was glad he didn’t live long enough to witness teleportation being used against him. A bottle gets thrown as his head by a frustrated Paul Kruger. Too soon.</p>"

It seems like the last units are forging a frontline in a very Soviet formation. For now; bodies will block every bullet; but when will the bullets stop and when will they come knocking. Is it time to prepare the coffin?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode24-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rumors on the sub stated that there would be three Asias. Three unique takes on the supercontinent; the Grey Asia states that the land will be full of ranged units and ships. This asia would fight off all attempts to defeat them at all costs; while investing the production towards beautiful works of music. The Purple Asia believed in power; and thus summoned units capable of bringing cities to ruin enmassed. Unfortunately, their devotion stripped them of originality. Uniform and marching in lockstep, they would move from one enemy to the next like a machine. They were calculated, power, but predictable and exploitable.</p><p>And the final Asia was the Red Asia; who believed in survival by enlisting the people. Every hand a weapon, even if it was woefully out of date. If you weren’t a soldier, you were producing the grains to feed such an army. The Red Asia would never talk of the others; as they had bullied many times before. And thus, with scraps, Pikeman and Junkships they arranged in every single plot of land, hoping for the chance to defend themselves.Hmm… This doesn’t mention the Brown Asia. I could’ve sworn that was important somewhere… Probably classified.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mackinac is firmly in the hands of Yup’ik; and thus the development the Newer Sexier Alaska™ can begin. Seriously; this is huge. Yup’ik was counted out just like Papua was; and just like them they kicked a Civ that’s twenty plus ranks over them. That’s huge for the prediction contest meta-game, but does this mean well for Metis that can now focus the bulk of their arctic army down on Apache? Has Geronimo made too many enemies? I guess we’ll find out soon...</p>"

This is the biggest advantage AI’s have is that when they produce a unit, if there’s nowhere to move it, it will just poof over to a nearby tile it can go to. Be it a hill nearby; or a country ten thousand miles away, taking up their precious land. Turns out when said nation borders a weak nation; one opportune declaration of war can weaken them; fighting an enemy on a front they never expected. And, as such, Salalah is theirs.

Oh well, you win some you lose some.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile; there’s some more pressing issues on the sidebar. Khamugs was awoken by the Taungoo; who wanted to rain hell on their neighbours as plans in Oceania begin to bear fruit. While Taungoo could send a navy over; it seems most likely that this is an attempt to weaken the Khamugs and cause a war in India with Indira on the losing end. A tactful move, but from my knowledge, it seems like this is likely to go nowhere through the mountainous terrain of Asia. Nevertheless, awakening the Khamugs might be the scariest part.

This is possibly the worst peace deal. Maybe, in the history of peace deals ever.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Taungoo seemed to allow New Zealand to partner with them after the Papuan elimination; making this all the more confusing as they rampage down Susaki. This seems likely to hold, especially if the Rifleman positioned on the city moves one tile off. It seems like… Shikoku are losing?</p>"

  narration: "<p>But they also let Shikoku move through their lands. Good on you for being so good Taungoo; but this is a troubling thing to do. Open Borders have had disturbing awful effects in the past. Keep careful.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Statue of Liberty. This was the wonder positioned in Agra in Mk2.1; built in an unknown city for now in Australia. This is huge for the production boost of Australia. If anyone wasn’t sure why they went freedom; this huge building will mean that even if they become autocratic; they will have a production advantage as their hyper large cities get ever bigger.</p><p></p><p>On this slide; we see Nepal for now holding the line as gatling guns and only gatling guns line the border. This is an amateur mistake Maratha; you’re better than that. Or, maybe they aren’t? I brought up earlier how Nepal is considered one of the best AIs on the cylinder and yet they seem to be losing to one of the less impressive AIs on the cylinder. It’s very likely this obsession with ranged units could be the preventer of an obviously capturable city remaining unjustly in Nepalese hands. Only time will tell...</p>"

  narration: "<p>I stand corrected! Indeed; it seems like Dzilthdaklizhinde (sorry Dawkinzz) was given to the Metis in exchange for peace. Proving to be a small but noticeable advantage to Metis and the cities they gave to Yup’ik were only providing negligible yields and only having small strategic importance. I’d say in the end Metis are in a good spot to benefit the most. Now if only Ontario was a more fertile battleground…</p><p></p><p>And that’s it for the part folks! I narrated this in a few days and had a blast doing it. I’ve probably made many mistakes as I am more so a roleplayer than a professional writer. So if I made any mistakes; you can wag your finger at me in the comments and I’ll correct anything I can. As I said in the narration; I will try to save load with my current mod setup to see if I can get ideology and wonder locations. Keep hype folks, and see you next time!</p><p></p><p>(PS: In before someone tries to analyze this entire narration for ARG clues. ;D)</p>"
