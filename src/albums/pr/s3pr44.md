  narration: "<p>CelestialDalek: </p><p></p><p>I know what you’re thinking: yet another Orkhon Valley civ - these guys are gonna be ridiculously overhyped and throw hard in the actual game. I mean, remember Northern Yuan, the Khamugs and Mongolia, right? Well… there’s still the very real possibility they do that. HOWEVER, TSL reputation aside, the Gokturks have the biggest potential of any Mongolian civ we’ve seen so far. There’s no Chukchi figure to the east, and Siberia to the west is divided between Tuva and the Permians rather than being hegemonized by one monolithic power. Han to the south can be dangerous, but they’re apt to stalemate themselves against the Ming, giving the gokturks a chance to break out. Overall, don’t write off the first Turkic Khaganate, they might surprise you.</p><p></p><p>(note: up to 100% of this PR might be taken from the part 0 prs)</p>"

  narration: "<p>JDT: </p><p>And so the Courier, who had cheated death in the cemetery outside Goodsprings, cheated death once again, and the Mojave Wasteland was forever changed</p><p></p><p>Supporting all the chaos that comes with independence, the Courier was the man/woman responsible for a truly free New Vegas. He/she ensured the fall of Mr. House and the end of the Legion's and NCR's influence over New Vegas.</p><p></p><p>The Brotherhood used the battle of Hoover Dam as an opportunity to retake HELIOS One, and came to control the area between it and Hidden Valley. With no organized opposition, their patrols began monitoring trade along Interstate 15 and 95, seizing any items of technology they deemed inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>The Fiends overran Camp McCarran during the Second Battle of Hoover Dam. In the anarchic months that followed, the Fiends asserted dominance over Outer Vegas.</p><p></p><p>After generations of being beaten down, the Great Khans were finally broken by the Courier. Those few who avoided the Courier's wrath moved north, into the wilderness of Idaho, where they tried once more to rebuild.</p><p></p><p>Ok in seriousness Mohave was one of the only nations this part to have action. They lost northern Honshu. Brotherhood of Steel still needs a bit of tuning for their power armor…</p>"

  narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>Timor-Leste’s kind of struggling recently. After the short period of peace, it seems that Timor-Leste, statistically, has more in common with Afghanistan than the other members of the Elite Four. And that’s kind of a problem, because Timor-Leste isn’t really on top anymore, but also, not really that big of a deal, because Timor-Leste is still statistically stronger than Afghanistan. The only difference is that Afghanistan seems to be making more gains against Turkey, while Timor-Leste is mostly stalemating.</p>"

  scene_title: "Afghanistan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr44-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rosay:</p><p></p><p>I'm kinda split on how to look at Afghanistan. On one hand I got to respect them being the only ones to actually hold back Turkey, but on the other how are they losing to Mohave. In terms of the game slowly becoming a game of Turkey vs the universe, I think they're likely going to hold on for a very long time, but it's probably too late in the game to reverse the inevitable, especially since they have not expanded much since endgame continued as they still lose to what basically amounts to rump civs such as Mohave. Though with the late game reset, Afghanistan is getting a massive buff getting free reign over the majority of Asia. Though as a Timor Leste enjoyer, Afghanistan I beg you please let Timor win by holding off Turkey.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Altima:</p><p></p><p>Such little has meaningfully happened for the Turks that I don’t think you’d notice if I copy/pasted their entry from last part. Attrition at the edges, lots of stats, coming reboot looks nice for them. Same as it ever was.</p>"
