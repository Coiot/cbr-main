  narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>Now then, where were we?  In rapid succession, each of your cities fell, until only your capital remained. In the end, it wasn’t Egypt who finished you off, but your old rival Turkey. While they may not have been impressive, Assyria gains the infamy of being the first to die in the Civ Battle Royale X-3.  F</p>"

  narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>With Assyria officially dead, Qocho officially reclaims its “Worst Living Civ” title. A title it will probably keep for the rest of the game except when another part ends with a civ about to die.</p><p> </p><p>Credit where credit is due, however, Qocho are defending pretty admirably against Tuva, which is no small feat. Doesn’t save Qocho from 60th, but hey, its nicer than anything I can say about Assyria!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Seminole has one city, and that one city is Semi-unconquerable until either they start chopping the woods near it or their enemies unlock Good Boats. That’s their situation right now, and so damn near (but not quite!) dead last they go.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>Welp.</p><p></p><p>In what turned out to be perhaps the biggest mistake of the game so far, Canute decided this episode to attack Brandenburg, apparently believing that this was the only path to survival. Indeed, Brandenburger cities surrounded his lands, preventing any further expansion, and if he let them solidify control over Scandinavia, that would be game over. But declaring war turned out to be an even worse idea, as Frederick-William’s composite bowmen sat on Jutland and bombarded Roskilde into submission, culminating in the capture of the Anglo-Norse capital. No one expected this to happen so quickly, and the already weak Anglo-Norse have now been left as a two-city rump state with no hope of recovery. </p>"

  scene_title: "Comanche"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reformer:</p><p></p><p>ATTENTION! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! COMANCHE HAVE BUILT A SETTLER! And here I thought they’d never build one. This changes everything. This is how it begins. The rest of North America watch out - it’s the underdog tale of the century. Wait. Iron Jacket. Where are you sending that settler. It better not be going on an intercontinental voyage. And what’s with this war declaration? Mohave want to funnel in units through a one-tile gap? Their loss. Comanche ain’t going anywhere. Their settlers sure are going places though…</p>"

  scene_title: "Cambodia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reformer: </p><p></p><p>As you can see on the slide, Cambodia is still at war with Kokang. Yes, Timor-Leste too, but much like the war with Indonesia, we must note that Phnom Penh is indeed inland and thus impervious to naval units. Sad, yes. Fortunately for Sihanouk, though, Kokang don’t seem interested in pressing the war further. We can likely expect a peace deal come next part, and then Sihanouk can finally focus on what matters: the fact that he is absolutely fucked and beyond saving. My fellows, save your prayers for civs with a chance!</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>Well, that’s bad. Giving Fez away to Mali in a peace deal is an absolutely devastating turn of events for Sayyida al-Hurra. There’s still space available at this junction, so her game isn’t over, but given that Mali’s gears have finally started turning I think this might be the beginning of the end for Tetouan. </p>"

  scene_title: "Egypt"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Oh, Akhenaten. You looked like a top 10 power not too long ago. But then you overextended, and before your army could match up with your territory, you got coalitioned. Now the south is lost, the north is under threat, the eastern conquests aren't faring much better.... and your capital itself, the city of Aten, is under siege, with more forces arriving at its walls with each passing turn. You looked like you were going to buck the trend of Egyptian paper tigers collapsing in on themselves. You were going to be better than the Ayyubids and the Ptolemies. You were the chosen one. But I guess some things just aren't meant to be.</p>"

  scene_title: "Khazaria"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Despite the odds, Khazaria has surmounted two neighbors and defended an indefensible city against insurmountable numbers. Bravo, you baffling motherfuckers. Their stats and positioning are still pretty bad, but they’ve won some good time here, at least in theory, so up goes their rank by three places.</p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "Modoc"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Slide 30 showed a Modoc settler in a nice location between Modoc, Cree, and Kwak, no Kwak units around to take it since they are at war, no city borders nearby to prevent settling, just open land. And they don’t settle it. Kintpaush what the hell are you doing? Why didn’t you settle that? You need more cities and you had the perfect opportunity in the perfect place and then you just didn’t? Come on. Do better.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Yolngu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Yolnging along at a steady clip (not to be confused with yongling along), Wonggu takes the mercy Wiradjuri has granted him and runs with it by not attacking at all and sends his one valuable asset, his small fleet of Lippa-Lippas, at an undefended city on Papua. Given said city has exactly one accessible water tile, I can't imagine they'll actually take it, but I appreciate the spirit. They gain one rank here, but that's just off Egypt's astronomical drop. They're really just as stuck in a prison of their own ranking as they were last part. Like the Anangu before them, they look content to just sit in their little corner, bank off the incompetence of their neighbors, and watch the fireworks. And honestly? I sympathize completely. It's like when they stick you in left field in little league, and your choices are to either go eat clovers with the center fielder or pretend you're a play-by-play radio announcer. Maybe we should invite Wonggu to narrate a part. Or send him some clovers, I don't think they're native to Australia.</p>"

  scene_title: "Uganda"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Uganda spends another part looking very respectable..... for a civ with two cities. They're a victim of geography as much as anything else, with every possible opponent just too far away or behind just rough enough terrain to prevent any real offensive. Though they're not entirely blameless, they did refuse to build any settlers. The one bright spot is that the same cage that's robbing them of their freedom is keeping them safe. You don't win royales by playing it safe though, bold conquest is key here. Even if they hold out where they are, eventually their great impenetrable fortress of self-entombment will be rendered useless by the inevitable march of technology. It truly is a lonely situation Idi Amin has put himself in. That sort of isolation can really wear someone down.</p>"

  scene_title: "Anglo-Dutch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>William has been fighting off people left and right, literally. And surprisingly, he had been winning a lot. Brandenburg and Castille both failed to take a city off the Anglo-Dutch, but now it seems their luck is turning. Ireland has nearly taken Rotterdam, and Yugoslavia or the Normans could still walk out of the war with a city in a peace deal without lifting a finger.Despite all this, with everyone failing more than them, they actually go up ranks. Orange ya glad you’re finally out of the 50’s William?</p>"

  scene_title: "Vermont"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>JDT:Vermont rises a touch in the rankings as other powers take a tumble. Don’t mislead yourself though. Vermont is still not in a great position. The American invasion has gone nowhere, sure, but thats still a front to look after, and Greenland looks like they’re setting up their army for a more dedicated invasion. Ethan Allen better watch his six, lest Led Zeppelin rock up a storm in his home turf. </p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Philippines"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>JDT: </p><p></p><p>The Philippines rise a meteoric 7 ranks, for reasons we do not fully understand. Well, actually, we have some explanations. Firstly, there are a helluvalot of civs who are doing worse than them. Secondly, they settled a very defensible and critical third city on the Malaccan straits, with San Juan Del Monte being a fairly defensible location that also shuts down a path into the Indian ocean. Sure, the Indonesians can probably take it with some effort, but until that day comes, its a third city, far better than what others have going for them.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Massagetae"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reformer:</p><p></p><p>Well if it isn’t my favorite tributary state! How you been doing lately? Not making any settlers? How cute! Wouldn’t want to challenge your overlords, after all. Just sit there and let the big strong Permians do everything, Princess Tomyris. It will all work out in the end. </p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "North Korea"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>With other civs struggling, North Korea ekes up the rankings. But Kim didn’t have a slow part. He managed to make peace with the Gokturks, and settle his third city on the peninsula. Small things yes, but improvements he needs to make if he wants to win. Now he just needs to deal with the Han...</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Brazil"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Brazil continues to be trash but at least that trash isn’t losing cities in the multiple wars they’ve had going on. And they settled up north recently so that’s another positive. Sadly for them they are still the weakest civ in South America by a fair amount. Even Kayapo, the turtliest of turtles, is on the same number of cities as Brazil. Pedro needs to get off his ass and start settling before he’s completely out of the game. Or he can continue to be used to give his neighbor’s units xp, his choice.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Botswana"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>JDT:Botswana rises up the ranks as their biggest rivals flounder a little, and opportunities become apparent in spite of intense adversity. There are still patches of the Congo left to settle, Angola is somewhat vulnerable, the Zulu get more cornered and weaker with every passing part and Kilwa doesn’t directly threaten them. Sure, Botswana still has pretty shit stats all around, and the window of opportunity is fading, but the very existence of that window helps precipitate a small rise. </p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Mori"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Mori takes a slight rise, and to be honest, I couldn't really tell you why. They're still in the exact same spot, their problems are the exact same, and nothing has really changed to help them much. Their stats are still atrocious beyond measure, their rivals in the region still have the edge over them, they still have no prospects anywhere. Egypt's precipitous drop helped rise most of the civs in this bracket an extra rank, but that still leaves two. Honestly, I think they appeared onscreen so little that we just forgot about their predicament. Which is just about the saddest reason for a rise I can think of.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Vladimir"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Well they didn’t die to Lithuania, so that’s something. They also have a decent number of techs. Maybe they can go attack Khazaria again since the Permians failed to take any of those cities? That’s probably their best path forward, let’s see if they take it. </p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Greenland"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>A war against Vermont should have been going the way of Greenland, with Ethan distracted by FDR and Burlington isolated.But a recent shot of Greenland has shown them with a massive floatilla, a mountain of debt, and 0 damage to any Vermont city. What could Hans be doing? Is he preparing for a massive assault? Or is there something in Burlington that has Mr.Egede not want to invade...</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Castile"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:Castile continues to Castall, having botched their invasion of the Anglo-Dutch and now being encroached on, by all civs, Tetouan. This isn’t a good look, and Isabella is rapidly being hemmed in between the random Tetouan city, the Pyrenees, and the shape of the Iberian Peninsula. The Anglo-Dutch are still weak, but considering how wars against them have been going, they clearly have divine blessings, so no luck there. The good news is they’re not going to die immediately, but the diagnosis is still terminal.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Indonesia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reformer:</p><p></p><p>Well they didn’t do much this part. They made peace with a civ they weren’t gonna conquer anyway. They haven’t done anything about the easy-to-conquer city on their doorstep, and in fact, there are two of them now. By two different civs. You’re a disappointment dude. At this rate you’re just food for Timor-Leste. </p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Ainu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:</p><p></p><p>Ainu comes up to 37th place by virtue of other civs being worse than them. Their neighbors to the south, Mori and North Korea, are senile. Now, Ainu has the rest of Japan to their south as Mori hasn’t been their usual navally active self. Will they use it? Probably not, and Japan will be left, not taken advantage of, for a while. They could be lower, they could be higher, you probably forgot about them for the most part, they’re Ainu.</p>"

  scene_title: "Maori"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>The Maori continue to drop down the rankings due to their economic problems. Despite founding a new city, or perhaps because of it, the Maori still can’t get their happiness above zero, and they’re losing 15 gold per turn with nothing in the bank. That means their science output is being reduced by 15 as well, and now they have the same effective science as the Philippines. That’s just not a good position to be in at this stage of the game.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Pandya"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>If it wasn’t clear already, it is now apparent that Pandya has blown it. They started in a difficult position, but their terrain was defensible, and many of us thought they could hold out, even against both Bengal and Afghanistan—that is, until they gave away Tirunelveli to Bengal in a peace treaty. The city is so defensible they may never get it back either. Now it hardly matters whether Alli Rani manages to hold off Afghanistan—we think she’s probably fucked either way.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Río de la Plata"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Rio de la Plata gains some ranks mostly because their position is a bit safe and Chile hasn’t bothered founding more cities. However, they aren’t doing well in the slightest. Their stats are shit, their position is shit (much easier to invade than either of their neighbors), they aren’t even settling really. What they need to do is go settle that space in southern Argentina that Chile has been ignoring, maybe then they can start to rise back to their initial part 0 ranking.</p>"

  scene_title: "Kyivan Rus’"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Olga's main role this week is as an obstacle standing between the Yugo-Lithuanian alliance and Turkey. I guess if you can't be an unstoppable force, you should seek to become an immovable object. Being that we in the sub thirst for blood, we don't like those very much. Other than that, she's probing the surrounding areas with a settler to see if there's any free land remaining to the south at all. She also has a very strong army, rushing military techs so she can have early catapults and one of the few horseman armies in the world. Alright stats, alright positioning, alright opportunities. Olga earns her spot smack dab in the middle of the mid-tiers.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Yemen"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Yemen continues to Yemen around, not settling, but not really dipping either because their neighbors are imploding. Assyria's dead, Egypt's collapsing, Uganda is in much the same position as them. They're at war with Egypt, and they've sent a sizable contingest to assist in the siege of Akhetaten, but seeing as it's composed entirely of archers and warriors it'd take a lucky snipe for them to get it over Chad. Even if they do get it, where do they go from there? Sure, it's a fairly large city in a good spot, which should at least help pump up their mediocre stats, but it'd be kind of cut off from their core. Not exactly an ideal springboard for future conquests. Yemen is stuck between a rock and a hard place here, and they really only have themselves to blame.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ming"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Ming rises substantially this week, and unlike most in this bracket it's not due to others doing worse. Even though they stay solidly in the shadow of their northern neighbor Han, they're doing their level best to be resourceful with what they do have, building up and watching like a hawk for their golden opportunity to stage a breakout. If they manage it, they'll have all of China at their command and plenty more tough opponents to work through. Just perfect for someone like Yongle, who sees himself in this position and refuses to give up, instead grabbing for any scrap of land he can still get his hand on. On the other hand, if he does fail, (which is still the most likely outcome) it looks like he's going to go out with a whimper, not a bang, scoring some serious points towards becoming 'most forgettable'. In any case, just keep yongling on, my dude.</p>"

  scene_title: "Zulu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>While the Zulu didn’t get anything from the Angolan war (and frankly, were never going to), they did at least settle some more (risky, admittedly) turf and continue to build up their stats over the course of this part. They still need to actually gank the Botswanans at some point soon, but hey, they’ve still got time.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Ireland"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Hey, the Irish did a thing! Good for them, now the isles are pretty solidly theirs until someone gets good boats in the future. They might be able to use this conquest as a good base for building up a stronger position, maybe even taking a continental foothold in the future; lord knows the Anglo-Dutch suck enough for that. I’m not holding my breath there, but hey, progress is progress.</p>"

  scene_title: "Kayapó"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>Kayapó’s war with the Muisca has ended inconclusively, as was predicted. Their stats, however, only continue to grow alongside their cities. It’s now worth pointing out that Kayapó is no longer bottom tier in terms of production, having nearly caught up with civs like Mali and Chad, rather than having fewer hammers than the Philippines, like they used to. At the same time, they continue to have the most techs and around 50% more effective science than anyone else. I guess this is the same thing that we write here every single episode, but even if they do nothing they’ll be a tough nut to crack.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Chile"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>Good news: Chile declared a war! And they have a surprisingly large army too! There’s just one problem: they declared war on America, not one of their neighbors. They do have a city near America, but their army is all over here, not over there. Classic civ AI... the good news, I suppose, is that America is pretty distracted, and the CIA doesn’t exist yet.</p>"

  scene_title: "Muisca"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:Muisca continues to expand in South America and grow up their empire. They seem to be an awkward third wheel stuck between Kayapo’s huge city boundaries and Inca’s military and city dominance, but they’re still doing well. Central America to the North is weak (although any war would become a horrid meatgrinder), and Kayapo doesn’t have a strong military built up (again, meatgrinder). Muisca is sitting solidly with a defensible position, plenty of space, and decent stats. Nothing to hate. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>If you forgot Kwakwaka'wakw was in this game, you’d be forgiven. They only made a brief cameo or two, and the focus was on other civs like the Cree. Their war with Modoc is going nowhere fast, and their mid 20s rank is mostly due to their isolated situation. This has been your Kwakwaka'wakw update</p>"

  scene_title: "Mali"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:</p><p></p><p>The good news: Sundiata Keta has taken a city with 9 population. The bad news is that he immediately decided to burn it to the ground. He might still save it due to the mod that makes happy civs stop razing cities, but this reflects poorly on him. Mali has 6 cities, including the one which might be burning, and a decent military. They don’t have much initiative, however, which is very important. The Sahara doesn’t usually make for stellar cities, and although Mali is situated in the Niger Delta, they’ve already settled most of it.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Started from the bottom, now we're here. Timor-Leste takes a slight dip, but they're still putting on a great performance for a civ everyone thought was dead meat from day 1. Between the incompetence of their SEA neighbors, Xanana's own historical incompetence, and the bad starts of Greenland, Ireland, Mori, and the Maori, it seemed like all our island civs were duds this time around. But the last person anyone expected to succeed had something to say about that. Timor-Leste has seized their moment, settling aggressively, building statistical greatness to an almost unnatural level, and not tolerating any forward settles. They've eked out a surprisingly good start here among the Indonesian jungle, and it looks like they're ready for more. So Xanana, you've got everyone's attention and the ball is in your court. Let's see what you do with it.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Wiradjuri takes a nosedive as our former last place Timor-Leste sidles up right next to them. On top of that, they’re bankrupt and completely fumbling their war against the Yolngu. They're still the strongest power in or around Australia, but the presence of serious competition to the north has given us pause enough to drop Wiradjuri out of the top 20. They still have the advantage to be sure, and they've taken advantage of their opportunities well enough, but a strong power in Indonesia is a massive, massive problem for any Australian civ that wants to step foot an inch outside the continent. Water is wet, the sun rises in the east, and someone is currently getting boxed into Australia. So it is, so it has always been, so it will always be.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>Angola fell hard this week, as nearly everyone in Africa and their grandmother declares war on them. The loss of Kuito to Kilwa means that Savimbi isn’t getting that city any time soon. But if Cabinda falls, it could be even worse for  Angola. Nevertheless, Angola continues to plop out settlers and expand, which further cements them as a regional power.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>The Chadliest of them all slides into second place in Africa, as they shed their earlier strategy of.... well, not doing much of anything, really. Not only did they finally get a settler out, they went the extra mile and proved their strength by taking a valuable city around IRL Khartoum to round out their core, and they're even seriously threatening Akhenaten's seat of power itself. Taking it is another matter, though. I think that between the fact that they have compbows and a little Yemeni help on the way, they'll just manage to pull it out. Aside from that, their neighbors all look weaker than them. Uganda's still weak, Yemen's no threat, the Normans are hugging the coast, Angola's on the other side of very difficult terrain.... At this point, I'd say Mali is their only real threat. Idriss Deby is king of the hill in his little region for the moment.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>The Normans hold steady after a moderately successful episode. Robert Guiscard managed to capture Memphis, the Egyptian city on Cyprus, but failed to take the larger and more important city of Thebes. He may yet try again, but his strategy so far hasn’t looked very inspired. It also remains to be seen whether he will take advantage of Tetouan’s recent settlements in his direction, which I can’t imagine are going to be well defended.</p>"

Ataturk is ready to march his armies southwards, joining in on the massive scramble for the Nile. And with Assur wide open, they stand to gain a free city. Or not very much at all, there are a lot of vultures picking at the corpse. Nevertheless, a new golden age may be in order for Ataturk, as they have very good stats all around, and are capable of holding the opposition in the Eastern European coalition. All he needs to do is make sure the Yugoslavs don’t commit too hard and to not go bankrupt. And only time can tell the tides of such action. </p>"

Mohave has 50% more military, triple the production, and each of its three core cities are larger than the single city Comanche has. If Prince Irataba manages to find his way around the rockies, this should be a clean, easy sweep for Mohave. It’s rough to do that this early in the game, so I’m not sure if this invasion is going to work out.</p><p></p><p>Also the Mohave settler in Asia is still going. Apparently, in tests, they usually like to settle that spot Yemen settled Asir. No idea where they’re gonna go now, but I hope they don’t end up going all the way back to North America. What’s the fun in that?</p><p></p>"

We don’t have proper population stats, but if I estimated properly, they only gained a single pop in the entire part.</p><p> </p><p>Unsurprisingly, America finds itself sliding out of the top ten because of this stagnation.

  narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:Kilwa continues their steady rise after taking an inland city. Their new and improved AI is known to be a naval beast, so it’s good to see them also showing their prowess at fighting with spearmen. They can’t get farther inland for now, but they can squeeze a city in there if my visual estimation is correct (it might not be). Now, all they need is to build up their navy so they can pull off naval fights and then find a neighbor with a weak navy such as Yemen. Despite Uganda being low, their mountainous position means that, in addition to being unable to be taken, Kilwa is likely not threatened. Everything’s coming up Kilwahouse.  </p>"

They haven't made any real conquests yet, but they've filled out the American plains and built a sizable army to back it up. The plains aren't usually a space for world powers, but none of the X3 civs seem to care what constitutes a strong or weak starting position so far. It certainly helps that the Comanche completely destroyed themselves right off, and America is sticking fairly close to the Eastern seaboard. That leaves them to focus all their energy and effort on the Cree, and they're going to need to if they want a ghost of a chance. After all, there's a reason you're seeing this slide before Cree's.</p>"

However, there is one piece of news worth reporting, which is that Han has risen to #2 in terms of effective science. If they can leverage that to build stronger armies than their many neighbors, they could yet come out on top in this competitive region. But until we see some action from Wu, he may continue to drop down the rankings, putting him at risk of falling back out of the top 10.</p>"

But they do have one thing that they are staying on top of: Stats. They got real good stats, the best in South America by far. In addition their position sets them up pretty well to stay safe and give pathways to attack others easily (easily for SA at least). Things are really just looking up for Tupac .</p>"

Over the past five weeks, the PR consensus on Afghanistan has been, it’s a decent civ with decent stats and more potential settling room than any other civilization, we’re just not sure if Afghanistan will take advantage of all that space or squander it. Durrani answered that question this week – he’s taking advantage of it.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, Afghanistan is starting to give me flashbacks of Punjab’s early game and its rapid settlement of central Asia.

An overwhelmed and outmatched Pandya hands over Tiruneveli after a long, grueling siege. This brings Bengal up to six cities and back into the top ten. With its strong stats, solid future settling prospects, and large army, I’d say that the rise is well deserved. Let’s see how Bengal rides this momentum in the future. Maybe take a page out of Afghanistan’s book and start building a bunch of settlers. </p>"

But contrast is great to have, so let’s actually look at Cree’s stats throughout the game so far. We know they’ve had good production and food this whole time, but what of their gold and happiness? Well, as it turns out, they’ve had a good healthy treasury and good happiness just as well. Compared to many other civs, Cree’s performance is a joy to look at. The AI is rather optimally managing domestic policy and dealing with an equal power (Arapaho) as a neighbor as well. I’d maybe say you could be settling a bit faster - they are at a whopping 21 happiness right now - but they’re certainly doing well enough for top 5. Time will tell if they can keep it up. </p>"

Gediminas failed in their conquest of Vladimir, but they accomplished what they needed to. They kept a possible rising threat weak. Despite Brandenburg's rise to the west, Gediminas is still just cruising along, building up stats and strengthening their core. I'll admit I am a bit concerned for them though, with the incredible power in Europe this game they'll need to make some successful conquests in the East before too long if they want to keep their lofty position.</p>"

Or that its not good that Gokturks have finally found the “make settler” button, but really, those are tiny. I’m sure Tuva will get around those hills and mountains eventually and Gokturks are still much weaker than Tuva. Tuva’s lookin’ great.</p>"

After bumbling around in their war against the Anglo-Dutch, the Anglo-Norse decide to try and do a sneak attack against Brandenburg and find themselves crushed. Brandenburg has proven they are the dominators of northern Europe, crippling A-N and settling much of the rest of Scandinavia. Sadly for them they still have Lithuania, Yugoslavia, and the Normans all vying for that top European spot, and their strength and distance is keeping Brandenburg just shy of the top spot.

With 10 cities, tons of space, an aggressive track record, and solid stats, its not too surprising to see Azykay on a fifth week in a row. However, that doesn’t mean his week was without any missteps. The invasion of the Khazars was kind of an embarrassing failure, they’re completely out of money, and their population is quite low. Because of this you might notice that deviation starting to creep up a little.</p><p> </p><p>That being said, none of those problems I mentioned are insurmountable. The Khazars don’t seem to be going anywhere, the Permians can always come back and clean them up later. -16 GPT is a lot but its not Uzbekistan levels yet, and Permians cities are small thanks to all that settling they’ve been doing. Definitely worthy of being on top.</p>"
