    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene01.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rosay:</p><p></p><p>Good lord this was a bad season for Comanche. No need to speak too ill for the dead, but there was nothing but ill for the Comanche this season. For reference, the power rankers expected Comanche to finish at a respectable 23, not exactly spark the world on fire but have some good moments, and maybe make a little regional empire but they did not place outside of the bottom 5 since part 1. Comanche will not be remembered often, and when they are, they will be remembered as a disappointment.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>Surprise Surprise, Qocho is (still) under attack again. This time it’s (still) Tuva banging at the gates of Qarakhoja. And it seems they brought a decent enough army to take Qocho. Will Süngülüg Khagan be able to pull out a diplomatic victory and wriggle free? Or will his time finally come in the next part?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>Modoc has become the target of several wars in this part, but none of them are a major threat. America is on the Wrong side of the continent, Inca would have to sail up the American coast, and North Korea would have to sail around the Pacific to reach them. So Kintpaush and Captain Jack can remain safe in their stronghold. I mean, it’s not like they can give away another city at this point.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Can’t say things have gone well for ol’ Khazaria this part. Capital gone, two cities left, no army, no production, no money, really just no anything. But at least they aren’t at one city so that’s something, a something keeping them from a slightly worse rank. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p></p><p>Cambodia goes up off the back of other people in their bracket collapsing. It looks just as unlikely as ever they'll ever be anything but a city state, but for now the jungle is keeping them less threatened than the other 50s civs. Also, can we take a second to appreciate the civball? I think it's a really nice one.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Cloudy:</p><p></p><p>Vermont really shouldn’t own Burlington anymore, but somehow they still do. I never saw a peace treaty between them and Greenland, maybe I missed it? If not, then Greenland really isn’t even trying.</p><p></p><p>Funnily enough, though, now that I look, Vermont actually has more troops than Greenland. Comeback imminent?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Canute, being a good little puppet of Brandenburg, has joined the coalition against Yugoslavia. Will it help them at all? Nope. Will it hinder them? Probably. Will they settle a city in the far north? Eh, doubt it. But this is all par for the Anglo-Course for the Anglo-Norse.</p>"

    scene_title: "Egypt:"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>Welp Egypt’s still a rump state, but at least they don't have to worry about Chad for a while. Turkey does not really have a reliable way into Egypt so that war is kinda irrelevant for now. Honestly the only thing putting them above the other rumps is that they only will die if one of their neighbors invades them instead of they are about to die from an invasion. Narrator ItsTruuuuuuuuuckMonth put it best when they said “We begin today’s episode with the hollowed out husk some people call “Egypt”.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>Well Uganda fans, I’ve got good news and bad news.  The good news is Uganda retook Mbarara.  The bad news is the city still might flip, Chad took Masaka, and now Angola is invading as well. </p>"
  - scene_number: 12
    scene_title: "Brazil"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>Brazil picks up a third city this week, again. But I have to say Olida is a way, worse city than Sao Salvador was. This is not a good replacement at all. As such, Brazil is still languishing at the bottom of the power rankings.</p>"
  - scene_number: 13
    scene_title: "Mori"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>We think Mori is the worst of the dynamic trio right now. They don't have a ghost of a chance at expansion on the continent, and the horrors of northern Honshu continue to be too much for them. They have a very high expansionist bias by design, but they seem to be just...... completely ignoring it. Them's the shakes, I guess.</p>"
  - scene_number: 14
    scene_title: "Emu"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>My favorite left fielder continues to get pitches hit right to them, as Wiradjuri declares a war they're unlikely to win again. If Wonggu has a time to shine, this is it. This may be his only real opportunity to make gains against a larger, somehow even less competent opponent. If he puts in the work, and plays his cards right, he might just come out of this with a shiny new city or two and far more interesting prospects.</p><p></p><p>Oh, who am I kidding. Yolngu will go right back to their two-city turtling the second they can.</p>"
  - scene_number: 15
    scene_title: "Tetouan"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Tetouan continues to hold Fes despite Mali’s best efforts, owing to both geography and some genuinely hard-fought naval victories. While they remain trapped within their geography, that geography (and Mali’s utter incompetence) at least keep them safe and outside of the bottom ten for now.</p>"
  - scene_number: 16
    scene_title: "Ainu"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>The Ainu have three cities and thus suck. Yeah, they joined a quarter of the cylinder in war against the Koreans. They ain’t getting jack from it. They ain’t losing anything from it either though, so they’ve got that going for them I guess.</p>"
  - scene_number: 17
    scene_title: "North Korea"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>Just like real life, it seems that nobody really likes North Korea. By our count there are 17 civilizations at war with North Korea (28.8% of living civs). At least. I don’t even like North Korea all that much, but honestly, this feels excessive. There are weaker civs and there are civs with more warmonger penalties, why is North Korea the civ that everyone has decided to hate? Maybe Mori has a really good PR team? Maybe someone leaked stories of IRL North Korea into the cylinder?</p><p> </p><p>Regardless of why, these 17 wars are bad news for North Korea. The good news is that only three or four of them really matter (Gokturks, Ainu, Mori, and kind of Kwakwaka’wakw). The other bad news is that Gokturks are a top 10 power and have the fourth largest army in the world right now. Good luck.</p><p></p>"
  - scene_number: 18
    scene_title: "Botswana"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>Botswana didn’t do much. Seems like they’re slowly letting the Zulu and Angola settle South Africa, and that’s probably bad. But it's not a disaster. There are still a few more spots to settle. Could be worse, I guess.</p>"
  - scene_number: 19
    scene_title: "Kyivan Rus’"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:</p><p></p><p>If the Kyivan Rus’ were not in Europe, they’d be looking a bit less awful. Their military could probably do wonders if they were sitting in Australia, but unfortunately they’re sandwiched between Lithuania, Yugoslavia (but separated by a mountain range, so for the purpose of wars they aren’t neighbors), and Vladimir. Their tech in their army is low, even though their science is decent, their city count is abysmal, but most importantly they’re just in a crab bucket and are about to be tipped into the bisque pot. They might pull something off, but don’t expect it.</p>"
  - scene_number: 20
    scene_title: "Anglo-Dutch"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:</p><p>Good news for the Anglo-Dutch: they have another city. That’s about it. Brandenburg is still putting them in existential risk, Castile remains a threat, and, most importantly, they have nowhere to go. Every other civ around them, bar Castile, is trying to settle untouched lands, but the Anglo-Dutch just wanted to finish making themselves French. They just need Brandenburg to not want to become French.</p>"
  - scene_number: 21
    scene_title: "Massagetae"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>We ended the part with Massagetae with Tomyris being at war with nearly a dozen other civs, and them fighting Yemen. While Asir has taken some damage, it's not enough to make me think it’ll fall. Especially with the handful of troops in the area. And even if they capture the city, they’ll still be right next to the Permians and Afghanistan. And that’s no good.</p>"
  - scene_number: 22
    scene_title: "Central America"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Central America’s rank does what the civ itself is doing and goes nowhere this week, staying at a lovely 39 as the civ continues to durdle on three cities and (mostly) bad stats. They’ve got alright tech surprisingly enough, and their geography is still basically unassailable, so they get to stay at “merely bad” rather than the “utter garbage” three cities should leave them at.</p><p></p>"
  - scene_number: 23
    scene_title: "Rio De La Plata"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene23.jpg
    narration: "<p>Msurdej:</p><p></p><p>Well, it seems ol’ Rio managed to pull himself out of his Cheeto dust crusted seat and do something productive. They’ve managed to settle a city behind the lines of Chile, and have a few more settlers out. It might be too little too late though, as Chile has also been sending more settlers south, and has roughly twice the army and production of RDLP. It might come down to San Jose de Martin sitting in the Falklands, waiting for death to take him as he plays WoW.</p>"
  - scene_number: 24
    scene_title: "Pandya"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>We didn’t see too much from Pandya this episode, but that can be okay. After giving away Tirunelveli, Pandya needed some quiet time to rebuild their stats and armies and pump out a few cities. They haven’t quite done the latter, but their lands are filled with their unique unit, the Maraval, a Spearman with an extra attack when fighting on the coasts. We’re kind of past the time where Spearmen are super relevant, but the Maraval is a strong one. Maybe it's almost time to get revenge on Bengal? </p>"
  - scene_number: 25
    scene_title: "Castile"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Okay, fine, I'll do an actual Castile writeup. Isabella is just about equaling the performance of every other christian Iberian civ, completely failing to expand outside her peninsula while giving up land to Tetouan of all people. Really, she's done absolutely nothing this game. Even the Anglo-Dutch look less pathetic, at least they've pulled off some stellar defense and held against all odds. I don't think it's a stretch at all to call Castile the worst Euro whose name doesn't rhyme with anglo-horse.</p>"
  - scene_number: 26
    scene_title: "Greenland"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p></p><p>Hans Egede is still trucking along, same as it ever was, but he's starting to run out of time. His old neighbors are still as unlikely to present a real challenge as they ever were, but in from the west comes an actually competent civ to come eat their lunch. With Vermonter incompetence, Quebec should've been Greenlandic, but instead Arapaho is making strong inroads into the frozen north. Greenland had better snuff out these intrusions quick if they want any chance at long-term survival, let alone a substantial empire.</p>"
  - scene_number: 27
    scene_title: "Vladimir"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>CelestialDalek:</p><p></p><p>Vladimir is a fascinating civ. They seem disconnected, to have poor stats, and to be cornered in between stronger neighbors. Yet they have shown themselves to be competent in wars as well as diplomacy, for they haven’t entered any stupid wars for a while. They’ve taken cities off of Turkey, a well-ranked civ, but would collapse under any other attack. Sometimes it seems like they deserve a much higher rank, sometimes much lower. We’ll see how much they oscillate as time marches on.</p>"
  - scene_number: 28
    scene_title: "Yemen"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>It looks like settling Asir might not have been the best idea after all. The city is surrounded, cut off from the Yemeni core and honestly, probably gonna fall next episode. Which is bad, but honestly, we should have seen this coming. All these strange exclaves settled this round are probably gonna be absorbed by neighbors sooner rather than later. Still, 8 population is a lot to lose, but with Yemen’s UB and UA, I think that lose can be recouped easily enough</p>"
  - scene_number: 29
    scene_title: "Indonesia"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Indonesia uh, continue to exist? They just really like being a contender for the cylinder’s most boring civ. Somehow they’ve gotten into the 30s by barely settling and taking one defenseless city. While they’ve done that, Timor-Leste and Bengal have slowly built up nearby, and honestly unless Indonesia makes some more moves soon they will probably get completely eclipsed, luckily they still have a couple really terrible neighbors to possibly leach off of.</p>"
  - scene_number: 30
    scene_title: "Ming"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>Ming settles Hawaii, and honestly, I had my money on Mohave getting there first. But that’s the fun of CBR! You never know what will happen! Sometimes you think Mohave will settle Hawaii and sometimes Ming defies all expectations and settles Hawaii instead. </p>"
  - scene_number: 31
    scene_title: "Ireland"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene31.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Oh hey, some action from Ireland! Oh wait, never mind. Back to sleep.</p><p>(Okay, that fleet off Galway could still do some work, and the Brandenburger navy is still just as sparse, but after that performance I wouldn't count on it.)</p>"
  - scene_number: 32
    scene_title: "Zulu"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene32.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rosay:</p><p></p><p>Zulu is normally a perfectly normal, maybe short of mid tier civ, but right now they could change that. Kilwa's war with Uganda is turning out to be a massive failure, and Zulu might be in just the right position to capitalize on that. Zulu's production is roughly on par with Kilwa, and their military is actually stronger too. Given that their soldier stat is A) mainly made of the Kilwalian navy and B) going to get smaller as the Uganda war takes its toll, then I can see the Zulu easily sniping a few cities off of Kilwa, hell maybe even the capital. The giant Angolan umbrella in the room is going to always stop Kilwa from being a proper top tier civ, but I can clearly see Zulu becoming a relevant global power if they play their cards right.</p>"
  - scene_number: 33
    scene_title: "Muisca"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene33.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p></p><p>Muisca is a bit of an enigma. They're next to two undoubtedly stronger civs that can't really touch them. They have weak neighbors that are too far away for them to conquer. Their stats are decent. What are you, Nemequene???? A mid-tier, apparently. The deviation here isn't because they're particularly controversial, it's just that no one knows what to make of them at all. I guess we'll just have to wait for some real action in Northern South America to find out anything about them.</p>"
  - scene_number: 34
    scene_title: "Mali"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene34.jpg
    narration: "<p>Cloudy:</p><p></p><p>Mali continues to lose ground this episode due to their flagging stats and poor performance in combat. Tetouan has now fully reasserted control over Fes, all Malian offensive operations have been beaten back, and Yugoslavia is busy settling the remaining unclaimed land near their borders. Mali has poor production, a weak army, and insufficient science, and while they still have room to expand, most of what’s left is desert. Still, confidence in Mali is not at an all time low, as they still have yet to drop below their episode 4 rank of 33rd. </p>"
  - scene_number: 35
    scene_title: "Maori"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene35.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Maori keep on rising, dishing out hard-hitting settles the likes of which we've never seen from a New Zealand civ, and increasing their stats and strategic positioning all the while in an Oceania with no real power besides Timor-Leste. The only problem is, their stats are still a little low. All that unhappy time really hurt them, and while they're making all the right moves to recover, they still have a while to go before they're ready to become *the* Oceanian power. Overall, though, I'd say they're doing very well right now, taking full advantage of their neighbors' mistakes in this overall weak region.</p>"
  - scene_number: 36
    scene_title: "Kilwa"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene36.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rosay:</p><p></p><p>So Kilwa, a strong naval nation, sends its troops into war in Uganda, a nation that is a good turtle and is nearly landlocked, how did they expect this to go.  As of now, the Ugandan military is approaching Zanzibar, though at the worst the city just enters flip hell like Mbarara, the other constantly flipping city. The Ugandan war will likely serve as a giant meatgrinder, and if it continues, said meatgrinder could have long term effects. Kilwa is presumably using valuable time to build units that will die in 10 or so turns, when they could be building, well buildings, that increase their science output, out taking out a relatively easier target in Yemen. Now their military industrial complex is weaker than their main rival Angola, Chad, and somehow even the Zulu. Right now, they should peace out ASAP and go back to building up to prevent being stackwiped by their neighbors.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>TL’s relative stats backslide a bit this part, and their ranking follows suit. While still a respectable power in their theater, their complete inaction as other powers consolidate does them no favors. There’s still time for them to get rolling again, so they stay in the upper half, but they do need to start acting soon if they want to keep it that way.</p>"

    scene_title: "Wiradjuri"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene38.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p></p><p>Wiradjuri gain ranks here, but in my opinion they've ceased to be the greatest power in Australia. Letting their own continent get settled in two separate places while still having a smaller army than their low-tier neighbor with two cities is absolutely humiliating, and on top of that there's a strong civ in Indonesia! East Australian civs basically have the continent handed to them on a platter, and here it looks like Windradyne is currently dropping the ball in a way few in CBR history have.</p>"
  - scene_number: 39
    scene_title: "Normans"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene39.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p></p><p>The Normans continue to narrowly pull off defenses of their more far-flung territories, which bodes well for their ability to navigate their current situation. Their main problem right now is that they're too spread out, and if they can just buy themselves time enough to build up a solid military, they can alleviate that problem. Fortunately, buying time appears to be just what they're doing, as they keep a Cypriot city that was brought down to black. The zealous Guiscard has a long way to go, but I'd say things are looking up.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Leman:</p><p></p><p>I’m pretty sad that Willie’s attack on North Korea ended in disappointment but the war is still going on. Now that everyone and their mother is at war with North Korea, so who knows? Maybe North Korea will lose their entire army and hand over a city.</p>"

    scene_title: "Kayapo"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene41.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p> </p><p>Kayapo is by far the most divisive civ in the rankings. Some think they belong near the top 10, some think mid-30s. As someone with a lot of confidence in them (despite how much I hate them; I'm still holding a grudge for what Marajoara did to Gran Colombia), let me explain why that is. Stats. Stats for *days*. All of them. Population, food, tech, even their historically-bad production is now 18th. They're hilariously ahead in tech, fielding both compbows and pikes in an era where most civs are lucky to have one or the other. And, get this, they're beelining Education. So their science is about to get even MORE ridiculous. The main concern right now is their relative inactivity, but does that really matter much in a phase of the game where the Amazon is impenetrable anyway?</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene42.jpg
    narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>America is by far the worst civ with 9 cities. I have no idea how they are doing this, but their stats are just kinda bad? Most notably though is their terrible production. Despite their numerous conquests so far, it still feels like they will get rolled over once Arapaho and Cree decide to have a proper war with the Yanks. America has the cities, they just need to get more of everything else if they want to be able to become the victor of North America. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Orange:</p><p></p><p>Yugoslavia has decided that they need to get out of Europe, and instead of conquering their way out they have instead chosen to settle the Sahara. It’s a bold strategy, but it just might work given that they are still ranked above the Normans who just can’t seem to get out of debt. However it would be almost impossible for Yugoslavia to hold their Saharan colony should it be attacked, so they better keep focusing on their main empire for now lest they find the Mediterranean the stronger power yet again.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr9-scene44.jpg
    narration: "<p>Emu:</p><p> </p><p>Allende keeps the position he gained last part because nothing substantial really happened to him this part. La Plata fit in some description of forward settle, but there were a couple Chilean settles too. They lost La Sirena, but that was never really going to be anything more than a joke about how popular it was anyway. All in all, very mediocre part for the only normal civ in a weird continent.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Angola holds their place at the top of the African rankings, but only just. Chad rockets up to just a place behind them, highlighting the fact that they're kind of stagnating. Their last war with the far-inferior Botswana was a wash, and aside from fitting in another city, Savimbi hasn't really been doing the extra work to make himself truly dominant in a weak Africa. Overall, the word I'd use to describe Angola is..... Competent. Nothing more, nothing less. They'll be there until someone really good comes along.</p>"

They’ve continued chugging along, founding another city and keeping their stats well within the top tier. They’re trailing the leaders in all stats, which is why Han has consistently been missing out on the top ten, but by no means does that mean they’re doing poorly. With Central Asia being empty Han has plenty more opportunities to expand and impress.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Emu</p><p></p><p>Mohave continues to perform very solidly. This part, we mostly saw their unexpectedly large navy highlighted, but their strength on land is nothing to sneeze at either, even when compared to the Arapaho next door. The list of players in Oceania continues to get weirder as we see a massive fleet from them circling the Hawaiian islands, just itching for a naval war. Maybe they're even headed to North Korea, which is the only person they're at war with right now. Their army does look a little thin on the ground, but stats say they're right on par with where they should be. Their place in North America is kind of interesting: they're not an instant superpower like Cree or Arapaho, and they're not a coast-hugger like Kwak. There's no one area in which I can say they're not strong, but they're not really dominant in anything either. All in all, perfect for the high teens.</p>"

To get out of here, they’d need to bulk up within their core, focusing down hard on science and military buildup, and then take advantage of a weak moment in their neighbors- a Turkey/Afghanistan war, for example. It’s not impossible, but the odds are long enough that Bengal has been bunted out of the top 10.</p>"

One thing to keep an eye on, though, are Turkey’s stats—after a brief spike a couple episodes ago, they’ve fallen to 17th overall, in part because they don’t have many units left. If you were to scroll down the info sheet, you’d have to get all the way to Greenland in 45th before you’d find a civ with a smaller army. Ataturk is presumably counting on geography to protect him from invaders, but that will only work for so long.</p>"

For a second there it really looked like they’d end up being a mid-tier civ by the midgame (though there’s still a chance!), but they’ve really improved out of nowhere. Their stats are worthy of a top 10 civ, and they actually have a positive war record thanks to that 7-turn war against the Han. But I must nitpick. I absolutely must. For this civ has godawful science compared to their competitors. They’re at 15 techs and a horrifying 61 effective science, and when you border two other top 10 contenders, that matters a lot. So if you’re a fan of this civ you better hope they can fix this asap or else this is gonna get painful real soon. </p>"

I’m forced to rank this boring civ high because they JUST MIGHT do something with all these stats and military even if they’d have to pick between Arapaho who has the production base to stalemate a long-term war, and the Kwak who have employed mountains to do their defense for them. Either way sounds rough. But there is a chance. Killing Comanche has netted Arapaho a hefty warmonger malus, and if America and/or Mohave joined in, Arapaho would absolutely lose, and Cree would be the biggest winner. Soooo…maybe? I’m not holding my breath.</p>"

I don’t really know what’s up with that, they have good enough effective science, good enough pop, but just low techs. If they keep this up then Kayapo might be able to run them over, and I don’t think Kayapo will do anything in this game so that’s quite a statement. Boost up that science Tupac and you’ll get back into the top 5.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>I would like to point out that deciding who was the better European civ between Lithuania and Brandenburg was so close, literally a singular rank chance on any power ranker would result in a tie, two resulting in a flip. While I personally had Lithuania over Bradenburg, I can see why many others did the opposite. The biggest reason for Brandenburg being rated over Lithuania by some PRs was the overall competition of Bradenburg compared to that of Lithuania. While Lithuania can take Vladimir without too much pressure, while having to deal with the Permians, While Brandenburg can easily take the majority of Western Europe, which is essentially free land to them. Another major factor is their historically strong AI, which was actually the biggest factor behind their part 0 placement. We have already seen this in effect, when Brandenburg just decided to “go around the Anglo Norse” and reclaim top tier status, and we may see it again if war is to be declared. But hey Lithuania has their own pros and cons, to be shown by our Lithuania writer. Take it away.</p>"

While Brandenburg gets bogged down in numerous wars, running the risk of overextension, Lithuania continues to build new cities, new units, and more, rising up the stats while crowding out their less ambitious neighbors. Gedeminas isn’t declaring wars all over the place; instead he’s building up and will strike when the time is right. As for who between Brandenburg and Lithuania will come out on top—that remains to be seen.</p>"

Those stats improvements are impressive though. Afghanistan has the largest army, the third most cities (tied with Brandenburg), the second most effective science, and the third most techs. In fact, their lowest major stat, production is still well within the top ten. They’ve also just picked up Civil Service, so they have one of the most advanced units in the game, Pikeman, but also all of their riverside farms (and they have a lot) are going to be producing extra food. To top it all off, unlike some other stats monsters, Afghanistan still has a whole bunch of room left to settle! Honestly, expect to see Afghanistan up here for a while.</p>"

Some believe it to be premature- while their production and city count are pretty good, their population and tech progress are kinda bad, and they’ve sorta murdered their only easy target in reach. All other nearby civs are either near-peer (Cree) or blocked by hell terrain. Still, they have a commanding hold on the central US, one that could easily springboard them further if they play their cards right.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Reformer:This part, Permians prove that they can do more than merely build settlers and wage war. When before, their stats were subpar compared to other top tier civs, now they have turned to improving internal strength, to great success. All their important stats, from production and science to food and pop, are truly worthy of a top 5 civ, now. Their numerous cities still have great potential for growth just as well. However, there is one very key reason for why they are not back to #1 this part. After the Khazarian campaign, the Permian army is rather small compared to the army of their rival’s in Tuva. A well-timed war declaration could wreak havoc in eastern Permian lands, and even the Massagetae army could deal damage at this point. But as the Khazarian war dies down, I would expect current trends to continue, and Permians will retake their rightful position at the top.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rosay:</p><p></p><p>Tuva continues its top position streak (of two, granted), this time by a more decisive margin. There's a lot of good reasons why, the big one being their stats. As we reach further into the game where stat gaps become more relevant, Tuva almost has the largest military and the largest production, which are the two most important stats to have when waging wars (tech advantage is included in the military might ratings). Additionally, there is still room for growth too, as there is plenty of settleable land, and Tuva has two settlers in the chamber to expand, and those are just the ones they have on the field right now. Military expansion is viable for Tuva too, and Qocho is learning that in the slow and steady siege of Quarkhoja. There still is the obvious issue however of strong neighbors, though that is consistent with all of the other top tier civs. The difference with Tuva however, is that there is a viable way to objectively outclass the majority of their neighbors, the massive and still growing production of the empire. All in all, Tuva outclasses all of their powerful neighbors by enough of a margin to justify their number one placing.</p>"
