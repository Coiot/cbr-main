    narration: "<p>LonelyRS</p><p></p><p>Yikes. Coming into this episode, Manchu were just another rump, fundamentally mediocre but lacking in style, dismally low on panache, and getting picked apart slowly by the twin crows of Yuan and the Chukchi. Coming out of it? Well, those crows have proven themselves to be ravens, slowly has proven itself to be quite fast indeed, and mediocre has rotted to bottom-of-the-barrel levels of awful. Quite the fall, for a civ that rated seventh overall before play started! Quite a shame, that we can’t speculate how much further Nurhaci’s living corpse may drop! Turn order’s vitally important for city-states and animated skeletons desperately trying to keep dancing, and it’s hard to find civs that go later in the turn order than Manchu’s 55th. Notably, Yuan, the last civ still doggedly gnawing on the exhausted bone, are not among them, going 22nd. So, yeah, short a miracle peace deal coming to light in the next, oh, half a turn, the Manchu are an ex-civ. Prime your F keys, Manchu fans, because your civ is already dead.</p>"

    narration: "<p>LonelyRS</p><p></p><p>The tragedy of all this lies in the stolen spotlight. Vietnam is on the verge of death at the hand of an old rival, two crossbowmen the sole remnants of their armed forces, their enemy having been at the gates so long they have summer homes there - and nobody cares, because just a few scant civs to the north, the Manchu have fallen so hard they practically shattered on impact with the ground. It’s sad, it’s depressing, it’s a fate more fitting for hapless Vietnam, the little stepping stone civ that couldn’t, than for any other. Vietnam lies in limbo, stuck in a truly creative hell, their fate up in the air with nobody around to bet on it. If they survive, keep pulling off the upset, abusing defensive terrain and canny unit placement against their less competent foes, they’ll merely be denied coverage of a sterling defensive stand. If they don’t? It’s likely nobody will even notice at all.</p><p></p><p>Still, it’s probably better than whatever Wales has been doing.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>So the Guals failed to land again........ great. Well at least spain can still finish Wales off right? Wait no Spain only has a single melee unit on land thats cool I guess. To be honest i just want a civ to fall at this point for my own sanity, and Wales has been an utter disappointment this whole season. Its not like Jamaica or the Tauregs who were expected to do bad either, they could've been a solid mid tier if their Ai had the slightest more competency than my dog running across the keyboard</p>"

    narration: "<p>MsurdejWell good news Peru Bolivia, you went up two ranks due to Manchu and Veitnam failing hardThe bad news is that you’re still in the spot you were at the end of last episode, with the failures of other civs being the only way you’ll rise.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Well, if you have to be a one-city runt, I can think of worse climates for it than the Carribean. Sure, the existential dread of “everyone can kill me and there’s nothing I can do about it,” has to suck, but you take the bad with the good. If nothing else, you formally have no further obligation to give a damn about the rat-race of the wider CBR, and can just chill out and enjoy the beautiful slice of the world you inhabit.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>This was a grim episode for the Tuareg, as their attack on Burkina Faso backfired as expected, leading to the loss of Aghat. The Tuareg did briefly take Elephantine, a Ptolemy city, after Burkina Faso flipped it, but that city is back in the hands of its original owner. Now Tin Hinan is left only with her mountain fortress city of Kidal, which is unlikely to fall, but is more of a coffin than a refuge. The Tuareg will probably never be relevant again, and Tin Hinan will have to wait in the Atlas Mountains to die, either at the hands of the Vandals, or in a few centuries when Burkina Faso invents artillery.</p><p></p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene07.jpg
    narration: "<p>Random Strategy</p><p>Tat are almost identical to last week. The Chinook are still sending them 1 unit at a time through the mountains to die. And Tat are still trying and failing to capture the stranded Chinook cities this side of the mountains. Really the interesting thing is what's happening to their neighbours: the Chinook are getting slaughtered by the Chukchi, while the Dene and Mississippi are duking it out on their front lawn. Though interesting, it isn't very relevant to the Tat because whether the Dene or Mississippi border them that's still a civ that could snuff them out instantly if they wanted.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>Msurdej:Somalia was mentioned three times in the last part. One mentioned that Lesotho can’t reach them, and the other two about making peace with two far away civs. A quiet part, but things could change for Siad Barre soon... </p><p></p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Anangu has come up with the genius strategy to avoid being at the very bottom of the power rankings by... settling a second city! This move has forced the power rankers, though Anangu is in an essentially identical situation to all other rumps in the world, rank Anangu higher than all of the other rumps on deaths door. Funny how that works, isn’t it. Regardless of this, Anangu is without a doubt on deaths door, as they certainly stand no chance of defeating Kulin, who already control most of the continent and are spreading out to Pacific islands. WIth any luck, they will simply be forgotten about like Tibet and live a long and happy life on their reservations.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>The Olmecs suddenly find themselves third-wheeling a major conflict between New Netherland and Rio Grande, the civ which was attacking them and the civ that took their capital, respectively. It’s debatable whether the Olmecs were ever in danger from the New Netherland invasion or not, but it’s hard to argue that their two biggest threats fighting each other isn’t a good development for U Kix Chan, which definitely prevents him from dropping several places. On the other hand, Gran Colombia could declare war on the Olmecs and kill them before the end of the episode, so if you’re holding Olmec stonks like I am, make sure you know the risk.</p>"

    scene_title: "Namibia"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Joining the runts of Africa, Namibia finds themselves at home with the Tuareg, Zanzibar, and Somalia. Squished in between Zaire and Lesotho, Namibia doesn’t particularly have any redeeming traits to help them get out of their sticky situation. Though they still have a few cities to their name, they find themselves ranked below other civs like Jerusalem and Hawaii. Though not there yet, Namibia joins the ever growing list of civs that may be soon to depart from this cylinder.</p><p></p>"
  - scene_number: 13
    scene_title: "Jerusalem"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Jerusalem, purely for the reason that there are so many rumps still alive in the world, is still outside of the bottom 10. They haven’t done particularly anything of real interest throughout the entire game, and likely will never. Perhaps they will serve as the catalyst for destruction if they are the first civilization to be eliminated, for they certainly have a slew of neighbors that could do the job. The Ptolemies, Kosovo, maybe even Georgia on a lucky day. Nobody else though is likely to be in a position to take down Jerusalem.</p>"
  - scene_number: 14
    scene_title: "Hawaii"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Ah, to be a Pacific island nation. Hawaii, despite being situated near the bottom of the rankings for what really has been the entire game, has actually faced few real threats to their sovereignty. That is both the upside and downside to starting in the middle of the ocean. We have never seen a real power arise from these waves, and it may be a long time until we do. Until then, civilizations like Hawaii will hang on by going unnoticed by the larger powers, until one of them happens to fancy an island getaway on one of their expedition.</p><p></p>"

    scene_title: "Tahiti"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>Random Strategy:</p><p>In the biggest war crime of the cylinder so far, the Kulin burn down 2/3d of Tahiti's cities, including their valuable New Zealand colonies. This is absolutely devastating and sets them back to the 3 cities they had all the way back in part 2. It's a testament to how badly other civs are doing that Tahiti only drop 4 spaces from such a massive disaster. Any dreams of Tahiti being at all relevant are gone.</p>"
  - scene_number: 16
    scene_title: "Neutral Nation"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Random Strategy:Despite being at war with both Iceland and New Netherlands for several parts, the Neutrals are still alive. The main reason for this is the difficult terrain and lakes that the civs have to go through to reach them. However, anachronistic musketmen also have something to do with it as they are so strong they have even allowed the Neutrals to capture cities (though not hold them).</p>"
  - scene_number: 17
    scene_title: "Bhutan"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>Bhutan suffers one of the most brutal drops in the last few power rankings, due to the complete collapse of their core in the Indian subcontinent. Their coastal cities on the Bay of Bengal have fallen to the Chola, and their capital is under attack from Punjab, which is wielding an invasion force replete with muskets, cannons, and other advanced weapons. Thimphu is exposed to the south and will quite likely fall if they don’t make peace soon, but the prospects of peace seem unlikely, and in dropping them to 45th the power rankers are acknowledging that Bhutan is very likely to lose its capital next episode.</p>"
  - scene_number: 18
    scene_title: "VOC"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>The VOC continues to climb up the rankings due to the death of so many other civs. Funny thing is the more I think about it, the VOC actually has a chance to gain cities. Think about it Laos is distracted trying to kill Vietnam, and the VOC is just equal enough to cause some damage. Also Malacca as clearly shown they don't give a fuck about the VOC so you could maybe get some sort of psuedo-empire out of a low tier civ. Also the VOC continues to go up despite doing nothing look at em go.</p>"
  - scene_number: 19
    scene_title: "Georgia"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>Random Strategy:Oh no! Uzbelistan is back for more! Fortunately the rest of Georgia is mostly protected by the Caspian sea and a thin strip of Perm land (which Uzbekistan do not currently have open borders with), which only leaves 1 tile through which units can travel. So probably safe for the moment? Though things are certainly dangerous. Not only because of the possibility of open borders being signed with Perm, or simply that their higher tier units are simply too much: Uzbekistan have the largest land army by quite a bit so may inspire others to join in, or could terrify Georgia into giving away free cities</p><p></p>"

    scene_title: "Zanzibar"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>The utter humiliation of Somalia must feel great for Zanzibar. Having spent so much of their existence under constant aggression from Little Boy Blue, getting to watch said aggression completely screw Somalia over, and ultimately culminate in them being beaten down to one city with abysmal stats must feel real good. It doesn’t actually help Zanzibar with its actual issues, naturally, it has to help the fact that they’ve peaked at useless mediocrity go down better.</p>"
  - scene_number: 21
    scene_title: "Laos"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Laos is in the middle ground between being a rump and being a minor power. On one hand, they command more than a few cities in their empire, which eliminates them from the very bottom tier of existence that at this point too many civs find themselves at in this stage of the game. On the other hand, though, they also have achieved virtually zero military victories throughout the entire game, and are struggling to take even Vietnam’s final city. I mean come on, they literally have like no units left. More likely than not, Laos is acting to keep the land warm for when Malacca comes knocking at their front door on they path of conquest.</p>"

    scene_title: "Great Perm"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>The way I see it Great Perm has two possible options that I can only describe as low risk low reward and high risk high reward. The low risk low reward option would be to attack Georgia, and due to the split empire not being able to defend both sides, some cities will be taken. The other and more crazy option, and bear with me on this one, would be to attack PARG. PARG is currently fighting a losing effort against Northern Yuan, and their military is space at best. Sure they may lose a lot of units passing the mountains, but damn imagine the hype if GREAT PERM can take a city off of PARG.</p>"

    scene_title: "Iceland"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene23.jpg
    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>Despite the chaos around, Iceland’s ranking stays in place at a firmly mediocre 39. A fitting performance given the general stagnation of the civ. Germany has resettled the one city Iceland torched and now has a better navy, most of their American holdings are useless, the Gauls have citadel’d flush against their British territories, and they’re just straight out of options. Their best bet would be to try and throw all their triremes at the technologically superior Spanish fleet and hope the numbers advantage works to their favor, and even that’s a longshot.</p>"

    narration: "<p>MsurdejSpain continues to try and pull itself out of the funk Vercingetorix put him in several episodes ago. And right now, they might just have a chance. With Two Sicilies fighting the Gauls, Carlos might have a shot at regaining his former territory. But if not, Carlos’s only shot would be at the Vandals....who are the Vandals. All in all, Carlos might be gaining some ranks, but his chances are decreasing each part</p>"

    scene_title: "Sweden"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>LonelyRS</p><p></p><p>The dawn of a new part for the whipping boy of Europe brings with it… a surprisingly decent turn of events? Sure, not much happened for Sweden this part, but on the other hand, not much happened for Sweden this part! Germany’s occupied themselves gunning after their other Nordic neighbors, Finland’s lead over the Swedes shrinks a little more every minute, the Teutonic Order remains surprisingly receptive to the game of serial fist-shaking Sweden’s been carrying on with them since fish first crawled onto land and began to breathe air - it’s a great time to be a loyal supporter of catboy Karl. Could have been better, if they’d developed into the superpower we’d expected them to become at the game’s opening, but it can’t always be Sabaton marathons and brutal evisceration of neighbors, now can it?</p>"
  - scene_number: 27
    scene_title: "Palmares"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>So the Vandals are unlikely to actually take Macacao. Palm just has too much of a carpet outside of it to not flip it back, even if it gets captured. Just getting that out of the way, because the fact that they’re even vulnerable to a North African civ’s naval invasion is embarrassing enough. That said, if the Marajoara decide to join the war, things will get dicey fast. Marajoara outtechs them with cannons and muskets against trebs and longswords, and the additional pressure will mess them up. Zumbi needs to peace out with the Vandals ASAP before their neighbors get dangerous ideas.</p>"

    scene_title: "Finland"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>Random Strategy:Guess who is 10th in military? You've probably guessed by the title of the slide, it's Finland; a score that is notably higher than even the USSR right now. This does not mean that Finland would win a war against the USSR - on the contrary, their production doesn't compare - but it does strongly disensentivise the USSR from attacking. Noticing that Finland is also 12th in science, we can recognise the clear signs of a science turtle. Noticing that Sweden has rather low science, the plan should be to wait until Sweden shows a moment of weakness and strike then, or alternatively to beeline a key military tech and get a good timing push, hopefully while the USSR is distracted by something else so they don't take advantage.</p>"
  - scene_number: 29
    scene_title: "Tongva"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>Tongva</p><p></p><p>Altima</p><p></p><p>So for once, the Tongva have the opportunity to find relevance. Rio Grande (in typical fashion of its IRL counterpart) has bitten off more than it can chew, and its outdated military is being routed by a civ we had no faith in on turn 0. The Tongva actually have a larger military than Rio, and could join in the fighting against them to maybe make some gains and put them out of punchline territory. At the very least, that’s what I would do as the Tongva. We’ll see if they have such initiative.</p>"

    scene_title: "Yuan"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>LonelyRS</p><p></p><p>Oh, dear. The good news: Yuan were the ones who started this BR off right by tying a declaration of war to the business end of a club and burying it halfway into Manchu’s skull, and now, some seven episodes and what feels like an eternity later, they’re on the verge of finishing the job and delivering to the viewing audience the Royale’s first (!) elimination. The bad: They, ah, might’ve gotten a little too overconfident in the interim. If their Royale-leading deviation wasn’t enough to tip you off to the fact that something very wrong is going on in Yuan, let the plucky civ’s loss of Xian to a civ most consider on the downswing do the speaking in its place. And that’s far from the only hornet’s nest Kublai Khan has kicked - while he managed to yank Bayan Tumen from the Northerners without much difficulty, he also managed to gain the enmity of the behemoth PARG, who have proven strangely non-threatening? Huh.</p><p></p><p>All conventional wisdom would hold that Yuan are due to get absolutely creamed any second now, but, somehow, throwing themselves into the midst of the North Asian bloodbath with both blades drawn and an unsettling lack of discrimination when it comes to targets has gone fairly well for them. Only fairly, though. They are still getting trampled by Taiping, and do have pretty good odds of joining the Manchu soon after their light is finally snuffed out if they can’t convince Taiping to stop gnawing on their leg soon, but at the very least their hovering around mediocrity has been incredibly entertaining.</p>"

    narration: "<p>MsurdejRounding out the bottom half, we have Japan. Tanaka falls a few spots this week, mostly due not making any gains from the Manchu collapse. But on the plus side, they didn’t lose any territory from the Northern Yuan. So....yay Japan?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Ah Kosovo. While not the runt of mainland Europe (Spain) or the rump of mainland Europe, (TAT) you certainly aren’t in the top tier. Just about any of their neighbors outmatch them in most ways, whether it be to their north, south, or west. The east is pretty weak though, they’ll probably be fine from there. With a rather uninteresting part this fortnight, they continue to sink into the abyss of irrelevancy. They say that there is a legendarily unknown empire at the bottom of this abyss, but nobody for the life of them can remember their name...</p>"

    narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Hejaz jumps an impressive nine spots in this part, climbing all the way to 29th place. Astonishing as it may seem, they are still at war with the Ptolemies, and this jump in their ranking inevitably reflects their successful efforts in repelling them. What many thought would be a slam dunk for the Ptolemies is turning out to be more than they bargained for. Though still rather behind on tech, the Hejaz are still persevering in this game, controlling most of the Arabian peninsula along with a solid portion of the Horn of Africa. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Random StrategyUh oh. The (former) number one shows why they were up there by attacking the predicted number one. Now PARG do not have much military but don't let that fool you - this attack is backed up by the biggest production of the entire cylinder - PARG can just make units appear whenever they need more. And they will be able to keep pushing and grinding for as long as it takes. A few cities have already fallen, including to southern Yuan (that's embarrassing) and with it Northern Yuan's stats have fallen all the way to South-America-tier. They need to make peace before the rest of the PARG steamroller slowly crushes them.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>The less successful Guay has seen a slight drop this part, though I'd argue that’s mostly due to numbers shenanigans and not any overwhelming disasters. To start off the good: Paraguay essentially robbed a city from Mapuche this part as they declared war on Peru Bolivia. The bad: Paraguay is surrounded by the few South American civs worth a damn and would probably lose a war with any of ‘em. Paraguay is no Mapuche for instance, but they can still hold on to be a regional power in a weak region.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rosay: </p><p></p><p>Gran Colombia has successfully forced Jamaica into the one city squad, and likely has more room for growth via all of its neighbors. Olmecs are the obvious one of course but there are options after that. Bolivar can decide to Rump cull and take Jamaica and PB.Alternatively could go after Marajoara or Paraguay, or just core up. A lot of options is always good for a civ, and Bolivar has no shortage of em</p>"

    narration: "<p>Cloudberg:</p><p></p><p>The Dene get a surprise ranking boost despite being attacked by North America’s number one power, the Mississippi. Why? Because as far as we can tell, the Dene are actually winning the war. So far the Mississippian attacks have not translated into city captures, and an advanced Dene army with better units than their enemy can field is surrounding the Mississippian city of Kincaid and looks likely to take it. Thanadelthur’s secret weapons are trebuchets and crossbowmen, neither of which can be seen in the Mississippian invasion force, which is putting Tuskaloosa at a major disadvantage. Whether the Dene make significant gains remains to be seen, but I’d love to believe that this is the start of a Dene world conquest where Thanadelthur takes over North America by getting wars declared against her and then surprising the enemy.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>The Chola are riding high on solid gains against the Bhutan, a war they may still be able to gain ground in. Still, it's hard to get too optimistic- the shadow that has long loomed over the Chola is itself gaining in strength in this war, and they just completely eclipse the Chola in every meaningful field. The Chola need an answer to this problem, and I don’t see a way for them to find one. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr8-scene39.jpg
    narration: "<p>Random Strategy: This part, the new netherlands lost the city of Mosfellsbær to, errm... themselves burning it down. On that front the Neutrals continue to be a pointless drain on resources, and the same can be said for the Olmecs. The more exciting news is the war to their south, with Rio Grande! Rio Grande is scary because it has the highest production in north america. However, their tech is awful, so the overall outcome was a gigantic horde of outdated units. And so far things are looking good, with the dutch medieval navy demolishing the trireme fleet in the carribean, while on land longswordsmen push on Ciudad Mier.</p>"

The longer that time passes, the more the window the continental domination closes for Burkina Faso closes.

First off all, they’re fighting off an invasion by the Gauls which is mostly a meat grinder causing both sides to lose units. Second, they still aren’t using their large Mediterranean navy, and the window where it would be truly devastating may have already passed. And three, the Ptolemies now have more advanced ships than they do. Granted, the Ptolemies have fewer ships overall, but it’s not a good sign.

Going into this part, the Ptolemies were busy conquering Hejaz when they foolishly declared war on Burkina Faso on the opposite side of their empire where they had no army. Now fighting a war on 2 opposite fronts is never a good thing, but that was last week so should have been reflected in last week's rank... This week they actually fought the 2 front war, and, although Burkina Faso did end up flipping a few border cities, no lasting damage was done and all cities were recaptured - a pretty good result. What it has meant is the war with Hejaz has stalled out due to most of the invading army being reassigned to defence.

Now, with the only civ that could contest him in the Pacific crippled, interlopers in the area thoroughly reminded of their place, and a part to core back up after making peace with the nation that dragged them so low, Kulin is… only benefitting from a rise of two spots, which is nowhere near as good as some of the stonk market speculators may have hoped. Why?</p><p></p><p>Well, Kulin might have a really awesome seating plan going, but none of that’s changed the fact that their ship’s still set to careen straight into an iceberg. Kulin’s proven to be a truly great Australian civ, yes, but they’re still an Australian civ, and what’s worse they’re one with a clearly superior neighbor rubbing shoulders with them before they can set so much as a single foot off their home island. The Pacific’s nice, yes, but South America’s so far away as to make reinforcing for a push there all but impossible, so the sole path the Kulin have to win the game runs directly through Malacca - a civ that’s thumped them once before, seems set to thump them once again, and is doing the whole naval conquest thing somehow even better than they are. Kulin look set to be in this game for a long, long time, but if they want to prove they can win it, they’re going to need to do something truly magnificent.</p>"

This strength though puts a target on their back, though, and being situated in the middle of the continent ever so conveniently allows them to border every other civ in North America.

We just vaguely put them in the lower bit of the top 10 until someone proves otherwise. Will they just implode if someone attacks them and plunders all 92 of their trade routes? Or will they keep building up, bigger and better, without interference? Right now they’re trying to make an intercontinental empire by invading Palmares, and it’s certainly not out of the question that they might take their capital. They’ve also settled random cities on tiny islands and on Greenland, making them the first civ to touch the top and bottom of the map at the same time. But is it real or is it all an illusion?

How to account for their rise back to the fore? It’s simple, really: they’ve got a larger military than almost any of their peers, and it isn’t going to waste getting ground down in a useless stalemate. Couple that with very decent production and science numbers, a position at the center of Europe, and a repaired military record after the thrashing of Iceland and, well, Germany just seems all around good. They might not be as flashy as some of those around, might not make for as good an underdog story as the Gauls, might not be as endearingly sleepy as Lenin’s USSR, but in a field of title contenders littered with obvious flaws, it’s hard to find any holes to poke in Germany’s empire.
