  narration: "<p>Vihreaa</p><p></p><p>Oh Benin. I remember how you were my first official write up as a civ. I placed you in 8th place. Rather close to your final ranking, I must say. What truly is there to say about Benin? They flew under the radar for most of the game, and really only became relevant because all of the other mid tier civs were getting knocked out. Some of their highlights for the game was their control of unnaturally large amounts of Gothic land, someone give that diplomat a raise! For a civ that turtles for 95% of the game, placing 7th isn’t that bad. I for one respect the AI that uses my Deity strategy to try to win the game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Gragg</p><p></p><p>The time has finally come for the Vikings. They’ve had one of the most impressive runs and their final rank reflects that. During large portions of the game they had human-like timing and diplomacy. They weren’t able to get momentum going in Endgame but played well enough to be the second to last survivor in Europe. If I had to venture a guess, I’d say they are likely this season’s last rump as well.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Rose</p><p></p><p>The Iroqouis have rather unfortunately, reached the bottom of the pack. Essentially Hiawatha just got triple teamed by the top 3, and now look like the next civ on the chopping block. The Kazakhs have struck the western plains, the Moors have approached greenland, and guay is currently c̶o̷n̶s̶u̶m̸i̶n̷g̵ ̶t̵h̷e̸ ̴s̵o̵u̵l̸s̶ ̷o̵f̵ ̵t̵h̶e̶ ̷d̷a̴m̵n̵e̷d̵ ̵t̴o̵ ̷o̴b̸t̵a̴i̸n̸ ̴t̶h̶e̸i̸r̵ ̶c̵o̵m̵p̸l̸e̶t̷i̵o̴n̶ ̴o̵f̷ ̷t̸h̶e̶m̴ ̶a̴m̶e̸r̶i̵c̵a̵s̷ . Additionally, with low stats across the board, the Iroqouis really shine below the top 3 survivors even before this hellshow of a part. At the very least the Iroqouis can say they died fighting, and had almost half a part purely dedicated to their downfall, not many get that pleasure. Not to mention, the Iroqouis did cripple guay and even for that little bit, it was nice to see the once proud abomination feel threatened</p>"

  narration: "<p>Random Strategy</p><p>This week, Zimbabwe mostly stay out of the conflict, as the only civ that doesn't border the Iroquois (who were the subject of the majority of wars). They did do something however, but that thing was to very nicely donate Songhai to its rightful Moorish owners. This makes them drop 1 spot. Last week it looked like they might be able to overtake the Moors in stats, but they are now clearly below them. Uruguay also increases their lead over Zimbabwe by capturing central america; they now have 1.5 times as many cities as Zimbabwe Despite this lead in city count, Uruguay is Zimbabwe's best bet at expansion. Not only is Madagascar free cities for the taking, but south america is quite depleted from the long war against the Iroquois.</p><p></p>"

  scene_title: "Uruguay"

  narration: "<p>Altima</p><p></p><p>The dog bites back. After being pushed all the way south into the furthest tip of South America and bravely pushing further north and into the Iroquois core, and while most of this likely comes down to the ambiguously-buggy refusal of the Iroquois to annex any of their conquered territories (including the briefly-reconquered Metis territory), progress is progress even when it comes down to the idiocy of another. This puts Lavalleja in an interesting predicament- while he can keep dunking on Hiawatha, there’s not much Iroqouis left to eat, and every other major power has a larger military than him. Worse, because of the same error that led to the Iroquois not annexing the west, all of his northern holdings are puppeted, which will make it harder for him to bulk up. Still, he has solid stats, even if some percentage of them are going to waste on puppets, and at least currently seems to be buddy-buddy with Kaz. His future is uncertain, but his current path is definitely better than the one he was walking a mere two parts ago.</p>"

  scene_title: "Moors"

  narration: "<p>Techno</p><p></p><p>This part was excellent if you were a neighbor to the Iroquois, and the Moors certainly took part in the banquet, snagging a few cities along the coast. But the Iroquois weren't the only ones on the menu - the Moors also killed off Benin, the Vikings, and took bites out of Uruguay's South American coast and Zimbabwe's North African holdings. Only one civ remained untouched; the domains of the Great Khan have yet to face off against the Moors. This puts the Moors in an interesting position. They have a demonstrated, albeit marginal, combat edge over their close rivals of Uruguay and Zimbabwe. But their strength against the Kazakhs remains untested, and the Moors are in by far the best position to capitalize on Kazakh weakness but are also the most vulnerable of the relevant civs to a Kazakh incursion. The Moors could still win this. But they must play their cards well to pull it off.</p>"

  scene_title: "Kazakhs"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-pr52-scene07.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Shaggy</p><p></p><p>After ages and ages of hitting their collective heads against the wall of Alaska, the Kazakhs have broken through and have finessed one of the biggest “peaceful” land agreements in the history of the cylinder. I guess you really can throw enough hovertanks at a problem until it gets resolved. The Kazakhs are far and away the lead this week and remain the civ to beat. In my own estimation, I’d say that their biggest threat at the moment is a coalition of Moors and Uruguay attacking them from all sides. That’s a pretty good place to be, having your biggest threat be two civs who have been squabbling over islands for the last century or two somehow setting aside their differences and trying to fight you. Things are looking up for Ablai.</p><p></p>"
