  narration: "<p>Hello everyone; it’s me /u/LunarNeedle again for a quick on-the-spot narration after a narrator couldn’t make it. It’s also Thanksgiving as I narrate so Dawkinzz can attend his boring real life stuff. I assure you, CBR is more important.Jokes aside, it’s going to be an interesting episode as tensions flare up, and wars get pushed to the limit</p>"

  narration: "<p>Speaking of being pushed to limits. I’m formally sorry to Dawkinzz. I went a bit overboard last episode, so I made this narration a lot shorter so you can rest your vocal chords after an exciting holiday season. I hope that /u/lungora will accept this apology. Ignore the gun Dawkinzz. Just keep on talking.</p>"

  narration: "<p>/u/Vihreaa is insane; we even left out some images due to the speedy nature of the part without Reon overseeing it and he still made an amazing map with more features. Now; puppeted cities are darker than annexed cities; showcasing the scars of war. A lot of Kazahk cities remain puppeted while the Yup’ik struggle with their sick new gains. Can’t wait to see it change.</p>"

  narration: "<p>For another map; we turn to /u/thehonestyfish’s Greatest Extent series which continues to catalog the maximum size the fallen empires risen. We see here Papua; who once had a commanding presence on the continent; swept away by New Zealand in a fit of rage. It’s honestly sad to look at this. Papuan green is better than all others.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We open the narration with Metis infesting the Apache lands; having obviously taken open borders in the peace deal. I wonder if they taken some Apache luxuries in the peace deal to secure safe passage. Regardless, it seems with the flood of units flowing in; that Apache will have to have lightning quick decision to retain their cities with most of the units around their immediate core. We can also notice some Great War Infantry joining alongside Rifleman near Shis-inday, which could mean that these field guns will be more readily replaced with Artillery soon. Tick tock, Geronimo; tick tock.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This is looking back. Crossbowmans try valiantly to take back the homeland; but Cavalry are clashing with crossbowman to the east while lancers dies around Yin to rifleman and gatling guns. Unless peace is sued; this is unlikely to be anything but devastating for Qing. I expect the navy to flip and eventually control Baoding before Beijing falls. Qing Kahmchatka might be their last hope. I imagine the many Qing great people must be in direct talks with the Khamug electorate to intervene in the conflict with Qin.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile Nazca declares on Shikoku. Which might be a thing with the amount of garbage ships off the Nazca capital. It might, but New Zealand war might be a bigger distraction.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tenanyocan, Texcoco fall down alongside Huexotzinco that fell last part off-screen. With a smattering of units; more settlers then combat ready units; it’s only time until the swordsman and crossbowman get wiped away. The Tongan units nearby brought popcorn. They might not be causing the destruction, but I imagine they are enjoying it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Silence hits the snowy warfront as an armistice was fired off screen. The many units begin to realize exactly what happened. So many units flipped; and in the end the Kazakhs have pushed the Evenks into two northern colonies of equal size; eviscerated the huge piles of Reindeer warriors and set the record strength on their viability. The Kazakhs are something to be feared; which considering what other blue Civ lies in South America, that might be a good thing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I might be incorrect here; but are the Vikings positioning to attack the Sami. Somehow, the ice grandmother herself has managed to lose majority of her carpet to irrelevant wars a couple parts ago and still hasn’t recarpeted. Perhaps she’s friendly with her neighbours; and Ragnar will not have any of that.</p><p></p><p>In other words; there’s some resolutions that have been discussed. We’ll show them in further detail by the end of the album. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh, so about capturing Tosa… It seems that would require confidence in your ability prowess; and that doesn’t seem to be on the docket for Seddon as his units get shredded. Perhaps this was an advanced powerplay; as while he gets shredded; army pressure is focused internally at the country rather than sending their massive submarine fleet to patrol the waters. Also on this screenshot is the Shikokan UU the Kurofune floating around the puppeted city of Taejon; which replaces the Frigate with a range of three. A shame submarines are floating around though; but it’s nice to see. Pretty nice icon too.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>What… happened to the Moor army? I remembered it was numerous and filled every tile; now the army around Qurtubah is Haitian instead of Moorish. Maybe they didn’t get paid enough so they all went into piracy. Explains the overwhelming amount of Privateers at least.</p>"

  scene_title: "Remember The Kruger"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>I was thinking they moved their army to the Beninese front; but I don’t see that. What happened to the Moor army? Did they just carpet delete to recover from gold problems? Well, whatever they did; they left a gap for Benin to fill, but I’d remain cautious until Madagascar units stopped appearing in your territory; as those buggers get everywhere. Keep the Czech in though, I love those little guys.PS: I swear; every time I see the Benin UU; I remember the 3D Maze Wallpaper. I imagine that’s what the Czech’s are experiencing. Nostalgia.</p>"

  scene_title: "Drink The Grape Kool-Aid"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yin flips for most likely the last few times as the giga-city of Beijing is now on the frontline. With the amount of melee units beginning to shrink more, it seems that time is beginning to dwindle. Can they sue for peace in time? I’m beginning to expect them to be relegated to the far north once their capital falls.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile irrelevant war was declared on two empires far away from each other meanwhile more people declare peace on the dying empire of Qing. I wonder if anyone will come to their aid.</p>"

  scene_title: "2Fort In A Nutshell"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>There’s so many machine guns and not enough people behind the guns I feel. I would say there’s not enough people; but each of these cities are millions upon millions of people within their walls. It’s absolutely insane that I think that the only thing this war will do is allow for peacekeepers to infiltrate Nepalese lands, which is honestly a more immediate problem than any Marathan and Kazakh units.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Goo Extends"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>So, uh; whoever voted that New Zealand will advance in the prediction contest deserves a swift high five as it seems that any major downside of the Shikokan war will mean little as the hand of Robin Williams extends over Japan. We can’t see much; but Sukumo at the top of the screen is already taking damage. In addition, Susaki is fully in the grip of Seddon with little hope of capture due to Madagascan influence. Once more, the balance in the Asian/Oceanic theater changes like a ball in a roulette wheel. Spinning round and round… Where will it end up?</p><p></p><p>Also, the Great Firewall was built; setting up the cyberstate in Montevideo. All bow down to the Uruguay overlords.</p>"

  scene_title: "Peace..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s unlikely the pain of war will rip through this continent for a long time; allowing for some pretty big cities to sprout up here. With no little puppeted cities, this will prove to be a slow but effective land force allowing Iroquois to project their power up to Greenland and beyond. Dare I say, they can project their power to the Manx? I dare.</p>"

  scene_title: "Calm Before The Storm"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems that Shikoku might have a chance to take down the Taungoo navy here for now; but I have a large feeling that war here will be decided on who can get their garbage patch to the frontline; however I would take the Taungoo mixed navy over the unrestricted submarine warfare strategy the Shikokans currently employ. Once more Tonga watches. Always there... Always watching...</p>"

  scene_title: "Madagascar Spreads"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Isn’t there a supply limit? You know, that thing that is supposed to prevent five city empires from flooding every single tile that exists in the world. This has to be illegal, Madagascar. Meanwhile, Palmyra just sits there. Doing nothing. Menacingly.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Maximum Extent Of Damage"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems this is the line that Shikokan troops will be able to do damage in; as Whangamata takes air raid damage while armies come in to reinforce the front. This seems to be the extent of the Shikokan projection of power; especially with a new challenger threatening the very seas.</p>"

  scene_title: "War Comes To Hawaii"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>There must be some people happy to see a screenshot of this region as Monywa get stricken down by privateers and, for some reason, a Cavalry. I expect this to be Shikokan for some time unless Taungoo get here really soon. I am pleased by the resistance around Myede though; but it seems both navies will get in place in time. I guess it’s time for the true navy culling of Taungoo and Shikoku</p>"

  scene_title: "Thinning Fronts"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The grind of North America is beginning to reach a boiling point as another wall of units begin to threaten the once proud army of Hiawatha further. Gone is the unit walls that once blanketed this area and now two relatively closely matched armies fight over ruins of Chuuk’anen and Chihene. The only thing knowing over this; is the real winner of this war is Aztec’s who can focus their attention at survival. The Moorish worker strikes on the beaches of Jaketown; fighting for a brighter tomorrow. Good job worker; you might keep the Aztecs alive. Maybe...</p>"

  scene_title: "Venice who?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Moors are pulling a poor move by stripping their army clean in favor of a growing blob of privateers. Perhaps their interest lie on lining their coast with growing amounts of carriers to eliminate the Manx; a noble goal for sure. </p>"

  scene_title: "Apache Strikes Back"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The melee unit force around the frontline is beginning to shrink as the units clash. I think the frontline might shed a few units and push up to Shis-Inday again; especially as the former Poverty Point capital is snipped. Meanwhile, an Aztec swordsman flexes east of Tsokanende. Such a hero.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nubia; how’re you doing. Obviously winning the game, considering I think this is the first time I mentioned you. Speaking of, it seems your army is being filled with Nenet units; which is funny all things considered. Speaking of being filled; Madagascan units flood up to Udo now; confirming my fears. I’m beginning to think Madagascar might take Benin. My only response is, please do. Please.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems that capturing and killing Papua might’ve not been the best for relations as it has caused the ultra scary Maratha army to declare war. Truely, a conflict for the ages. </p>"

  scene_title: "Ghost Carriers"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Iroquois sending in a big boi army to capture and hold the naval cities of Ganneious and Itsahahiti. Carriers are beginning to be filled as more modern units begin to flood the seas from the technologically superior Uruguay. It’s without doubt that anyone that fights Uruguay has to bring a carpet; but I don’t think any army could hold them off forever. It’s only a matter of time Hiawatha.</p><p></p><p>Of note; the model for the carriers appear to be missing on the Iroquois fleet. Dare we see a ghost carrier?</p>"

  scene_title: "Stop Fighting"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Wait; is there fighting going between Kuikuro and Venezuela? I couldn’t tell; except by the amazing lack of units in the Venezuelan core. Although that might be because they’re busy eliminating poor ol’ Aztecs. Oh well, they have an excuse unlike the Moors.</p>"

  scene_title: "Eldritch Fears"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh boy; while we’re sitting here playing Civ5; Haida be playing Civ7 where unit stacking is back; showcasing an impressive fleet of six boats on one tile. I have a feeling something is amiss, but I can’t tell. Also, Taungoo seem to have occupied Haidan lands; which is quite amusing. /u/EmeraldRange once more said no, and thus the war to eliminate Qing was closed. Sorry Haida; maybe next time.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Monywa Retained"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems the attack on Monywa has fizzled out while Shikoku’s navy seems confused. It seems that having everyone hate you might confuse your priorities. Who knows if this will flip after all. Meanwhile, Taungoo approaches. Will you be capable to defend Shikoku?</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Nepalese Gains?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>I can’t believe it. Nepal might be actually benefiting from this war; and that’s really sad. Zin’me, a new Taungoo city, seems to be stealing more and more land from Kathmandu. I wonder how Nepal would fair a lovely hand from Taungoo. I’d think they can conquer Shikoku and Nepal, and that’s scary.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Twin Fronts"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems the city of Sukumo will be the first casualty in favor of Taungoo with this impressive smattering of units surrounding the ports; blockaging trade as they shrink the navy before taking the city. This city is far better than most island cities due to impressive amounts of atolls and mines providing some good production base. I think it could further assist Taungoo as they push north; showcasing projection of power greater than any Civilization aside from Mk2 Vietnam; who managed to capture all the way to Arabia before losing it all to the Boers and then Brazil.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Real Junkships"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Endgame; a project made to ensure every season of CBRX has a victor, was made a necessity by exactly this. Armies of outdated junk ships floating around in the ocean awaiting a relevant war; only to grind uselessly against each other and block all other ships, creating a garbage patch that spreads the cylinder. In other news; it seems that irrelevant wars will be fought at sea with all contestants having some ships floating aimlessly in the sea. Only time will tell if they actually see relevant combat.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Counterattack"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>While it seems cool that Taungoo are on the attack after being surrounded, there’s some things to note. The first is that these ships are hilariously out of date; supported by a newly constructed air force while surrounding ships aim specifically to eliminate the Taungoo fleet. The second is Taungoo are beginning to build or buy battleships to coat the sea. These units are boss as eliminating Civs; and easily are my most rushed unit in any battle with a coastline capital. Cool stuff! Meanwhile, Sukumo flipped to Taungoo. Expect it to flip for awhile but ultimately end up Taungoo.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Era Of The Battleships"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Iroquois seemed to shed it’s privateer skin as modern units like carriers and aforementioned battleships clash on the edge Porlamar. This battle seemingly will go back and forth, but for some reason I can see some of that Canadian tenacity in them.</p><p></p><p>Pointless plug; while I didn’t get my Canadian civilization in a state I’d be proud submitting; JFD produced his own Mackenzie King mod that’s very nice. Naval based uniques and a trade focus which makes a very nice contrast to my land war focused variant. Give it a download to support JFD; hopefully I’ll get the time to release mine in tandem.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sukumo Contained"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>Jesus heck; that’s a lot of units that just disappeared. That’s easily the most devastating naval battle since the Battle of Midway; where Japanese naval plans got leaked by cracking naval code resulting in the destruction of many Japanese carriers by a strong fleet and powerful counter attack. Amazing how faithful they were to that battle, as it appeared to be recreated part for part here. I imagine, then that the carrier about to die is Akagi. RIP.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Remember, there’s some major Civilization still running crossbowman. This is very disturbing. It makes me just want to glance at the info-addict document I have, but I don’t think I want to be sick. Uruguayan lead is impossible to beat. </p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "RIP"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well, Maratha decided to stop messing around and sent a moderately advanced navy to destroy the New Zealand fleet off the Western Australian coast. That’s pretty sad. Nothing else happened here...</p>"

  scene_title: "Battle For Sweden"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Except for one of the biggest declarations of war in the past few parts. Vikings have had enough with messing around with the Manx; and have turned their sights on the only one that could seemingly threaten the Viking core. The frontline without taking advantage of Open Border agreements is two tiles; made into one due to tactical Uruguayan units. One of which is a woefully out of date pikeman. Put that away; it’s an antique.Aachen loses some units to a Viking citadel; so it might be likely that Venice could declare on the Viking, but I doubt that’ll happen due to the visible Open Borders they have. Yet again, Shikoku was moving peacefully through Taungoo borders one part ago. Could this battle be by stopped by… Uruguay?</p>"

  scene_title: "Grand Council Of The Exiled"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems likely that these units here are just camping; but some have not come for pleasure, but came for business as damaged Uruguayan units parts outside of Iroquois, ready to eliminate any units that cross their anti-air guns. Weird times, folks.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Clutch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>At this point, it seems the only way the Apache can pull off a stalemate here in plain luck. They lost so many units that they are relying on their amazing unique units to equalize the battlefield. It could go anyone’s way at this point. The army south of Poverty Point seems to be non-existent anymore. Moors continue to be clutch in protecting Jaketown and their precious Great Merchant. What good lads.</p>"

  scene_title: "Gallipoli 4: Arctic Thunder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>I think New Zealand is obsessed with trying to take a city with minimal units. This isn’t Prince difficulty; this will not be enough. I expect these units to evaporate like dust.</p>"

  scene_title: "Gothic Thunder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>The war I pointed out aeons ago is still going on, and this time there’s something happening because as soon as Gothic researchers knew how to fly; they immediately send it to the frontline with six of these airborne combat devices striking at the heavily populated city of Sarai Berke and Atil. The tech advantage that Goths have might be more powerful if they could actually fight on the water or fight in more than two tiles on land. This might result in a few flips; but I think the Golden Horde will be covering this part of the map in it’s off orange color for many parts to come.</p>"

  scene_title: "Non-Wars"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>I was hoping either of these wars would have meant more than… this. It seems the war has entirely stopped between Nepal and Kazakhs while the units reaching the frontline of Madurai are already dead. I hope that both of these Civs just declare peace; give off some dumb city and go on against more fruitful neighbours.</p>"

  scene_title: "Empty"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>Wow; this war between the Qing and Qin has been a grind; as the population heavy cities in the core of China are vastly under defended. If it wasn’t for Taungoo; I’d have advised Japan to crush the Qin with Cantonese help. Imagine that. Canton reclaiming Asia. That’s an amazing thought. Also; resolutions appear to be passed. We have images coming up, so wait for that.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems that people around the city of Tura have taken to arms over the death of the final Reindeer Warrior. This land seems incredibly thinly defended. I could honestly see Khamug’s taking the capital in two parts, and I think Evenks know that. Cut it out Evenks; stop building navy; and build units and as many research buildings as you can; you need to remain ahead of the techs.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene49.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems that the promotion allowing pillaging tiles for bursts of yields in nearby cities has been retained on promotion as even more modern units pillage cities around the ruins of Balankab. I expect the city to flip a few more times before Zimbabwe controls it. Ambober is next, and that name is infinitely more fun to type and pronounce in my opinion.</p>"

  scene_title: "New Zealand what?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene50.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems that instead of defending, they are determined to destroy Taungoo and punish them; as units surround almost every Taungoo city. But just like splitting units along long frontline like the Metis did against Apache, it’s a terrible idea as there’s at least eight attacks per turn the Taungoo can make with their city centers alone. And that’s not counting the airforce. This might backfire badly for King Dick.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode25-scene51.jpg
  narration: "<p>Iroquois continue to hand Uruguay the L. With this, it seems like any advancements will need to be on the back of Destroyers and Battleships and not embarked units. Is it possible that Uruguay can win any battle? Are we overhyping the yield glutton?</p>"

  narration: "<p>It seemed like it was inevitable for the battle to be won, but like a plot twist you’d see in Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure; a new strategy was devised that changed the rules of battle. This strategy quickly  grinded the Gothic melee units down leaving only field guns to strike the city. This might be it for the gains the Goths can make. Maybe next time Alaric.</p>"

It seems like World Religion is going to fail; but I don’t know about Ivory. Do enough Civilizations have them in their empire or trades with other empires to make it worth it? Time will tell.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Qin has taken and secured the first three cities; and it seems like it’s over. Enlightenment Era units have arrived to help balance out the tech discrepancy; but there’s no way these can help. Their ranged units, and hardly fit for defending against his. This is a pretty unwinnable situation. I almost feel bad. Almost.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Nazca?! Wait; no. Did they declare on Shikoku? Will THEY be the defenders of Monywa. This is unreal. I discounted the declaration of war a few scenes ago and now I’m sitting here eating my words. Well, that’s interesting. If only Shikoku or Taungoo had more than five units at one time, then maybe something can happen. The only one here with a strong navy here is… the Nazca. They are not taking Oko… right?</p>"

  narration: "<p>With the front pushing up to try to capture Shis-inday; it seems like the lines were broken and once more the army gets pushed back. I don’t know for how long as airforce and melee units are plentiful; but the fact that Iroquois territory is two tiles from the Apache capital of Haisndayin is saying something...</p>"

  narration: "<p>With an insane amount of units flooding other nations; I’m surprised that there’s only a few units surrounding the island nation. It seems like if a war were to break out right now between Zimbabwe and Madagascar that at the very least Alasora would be flipped into nonexistence by the overwhelming presence of units.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It seems that Uruguay didn’t like New Zealand owning Australia; so opted to take it off their hands. Funny thing is; I could imagine them taking Meanjin for a few turns; which is hillarious given the situation. It seems unlikely that New Zealand will ever fight against Uruguay in the future though. Meanwhile; you can see the amazing lack of anything but Privateers in this navy.Of note; the ANZAC has appeared. The ANZAC replaces the great war infantry that heals faster for being in non-friendly lands farther from the capital, and has additional combat strength outside of friendly territory. Pretty nifty should New Zealand declare on Australia which… wouldn’t be wise. </p>"

Gaps forming in the navy allowing Venice to invade their lands as they use the Venician lands as a further attack point, but considering the carpet of Prussian unique units, I doubt it’s a good idea. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Pokhara somehow flips; alleviating border gore until you realize that Bhaktapur claims two tiles south of the city. Rage from all mapmakers ensure. I doubt it’ll remain regardless; especially with the sheer amount of units flooding around Bhaktapur. Also, Shikoku has learned from their elders and has built the Manhattan Project. This is troubling for anyone; especially Korea who sit right on their border in bombing range.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With airpower and a strong navy; it seems like Vikings can win if it wasn’t for the peacekeeping force of Uruguay and Venice blocking all units from doing almost anything. There was an attempt Ragnar. I’d give this war to Vikings if they can clear the peacekeepers; but until then it seems pretty even.</p>"

That, or filing an angry letter at Taungoo for denying access to the Qing colony. Taungoo responds with, “We have the power of a god!” while laughing maniacally.Meanwhile; Shikoku seems to have a naval advantage for now; but only possess submarines; which are a paper tiger in naval warfare. All attack, and no defense. Once destroyers patrol the waters; expect these to be floating husks.</p>"

Goths had done a masterclass job in taking these cities in a peace deal, no doubt ejecting the military that the Golden Horde uselessly into the ocean. The only one who can take Merv now are the Parthians due to terrain penalties. It’s only a matter of time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With a ring in Beijing; the remnants of the Crossbowman youth squad run away from the city. Forced to defend with whoever was available, women and children ran away from the coming gunfire before capturing the palace. The government in exile is chased along the one route to their new capital of Baoding; chased in toe by faster vessels on sea as they crash into Baoding. Cixi was seen locked up in a room at her interim palace, and hasn’t responded to calls. The council assumes direct control and throws every man, soldier and child at the problem. The violence is as bloody as it is common. The massacres begin without end. The future is grim. Imagine what it’s like in Baoding. Also, South American exploded; but nah. That’s totally not important. You know what’s more important.</p>"

What will they do to enact revenge; especially considering their population is hungry for victory after the poor performance against Nepal for the past thirty turns.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This time, with a new challenger. They were born on the hills and the desert; so what’s a gigantic jungle to them. They’ve been through it all, and they are determined to take Kuikuro. Godspeed. I expect the war to be a stalemate; but unlike Uruguay; they have a light enough attack force to move dexterously through the forest. I somehow expect this to go the way of the Nazca; just to prove my point that Uruguay is beyond overhyped. They scary as heck, but they aren’t game endingly scary due to competency; they’re amazing due to overwhelming power. Hear me now, quote me later.</p>"

The armies seem rather intent on grinding it out, but we’re beginning to see the end of where Nepalese troops end and where the peace keepers begin. Madagascar looking to scope out some free real estate.PS: I hate that those tiles remain Nepalese. I expect and hope for total Nepalese destruction for the injustice.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The amount of privateers around these parts is insane; and they are beginning to wrap around the Manx Isles. Meanwhile, it seems the Manz are quite technologically averse; preferring Pikeman to actual modern units; and early Enlightenment Era boats to something useful. I think the time of Manx supremacy is over. Something about cold Civs taking over the United Kingdom feels tradition. First Iceland and now Vikings. What’s next? The Faroe Islands? Pfft.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ivory seems to be banned; however the Taungoo proposal of their religion being world religion got a universal no from the council. New things are Embargo Maratha which will get some good votes. Meanwhile good guy Algeria will establish science funding; allowing even more ways for Civs to gain technologies. Remember; gaining more Great Scientist points is a good catchup mechanic; as they increase in cost with each one spawned. So this will massively help the smaller empires, even if it’s a percentage boost. Good guy Algeria.</p>"

Algeria seems to be pushing out it’s cheese loving religion up to Greenland while Nubia’s faith recovers, displacing the Libyan faith even in the holy city. It seems pretty evenly split; although the Iroquois religion appears to be slowly overtaken by the Yup’ik religion. Exciting stuff. Tune in next time while we watch these colors change even more, and maybe a war to spice things up. It’s been a pleasure narrating again for you all on short notice, so I hope to see you next time.</p>"
