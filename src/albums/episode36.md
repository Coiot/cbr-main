  narration: "<p>Hello and welcome friends and fellow observers of internet robot cockfights; My name is Brendan, also known as u/Sir_Brendan on the subreddit and discord. I’ve been with the BR since episode 13 of Mk.I and have seen my fair share of Australia’s domination of their Island neighbors. This part is short, about 35 - 40 slides; but filled with many references, some analyzing, and plenty of dead civilians. Add all that together and you have the marble cake equivalent of CBR AI games. So get your milk and letttssss GOOOOOO!!</p>"

  narration: "<p>For the OC highlight, I chose to put in the spotlight this amazing piece of honest reporting. Nowhere else on the Cylinder can you find such an honest take on the news, and it's good to see in this far off future year of the 4000’s that someone still wishes to protect the eyes of our children by printing paper and not using Holo-broadcast.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Vihreaa yet again put together a great map for all of us to ~~gawk~~ at. Although I have to say there seems to be a mistake, and that's the fact that the Apache are smaller than they actually are. Oh well, they must be on the payroll of the Iroquois.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And here is u/Edse1991’s amazing tile accurate map, and yet again I see another amazing artist being used to spread Iroquois propaganda, shame really. But aside from that we see that the Qin and Australia making good sized gains from their respective wars against the Khamugs and the Nazca, while the Goths gained some back waters in Tibet. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Yet again those perfidious Iroquois stay in the top spot, over the rightful 1st place of the Apache. My case is that if you take away the facts that the Iroquois have a huge military, an amazing amount of production, have finished the tech tree, dwarf the Apache in both amount of cities and the amount of people, and their superior bite and hold strategy that the no opponent has been able to stave off; then it's obvious that the Apache is the clear #1.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We open up with an amazing first image and the 2 things I wish to point out on this slide:</p><p></p><p>1) From what I can tell, Shikoku has used the first nuke of the game. And the place they have used it is the Haida capital of Ninstints. This means one thing to me, and that's that Shikoku has total control of the Skies between them and Ninstints (maybe even farther than that). Luckily for the Haida AI, all AI seems to prefer to use bombers against cities and not units, but unfortunately Nukes damage units near the target.</p><p></p><p>2) Look at the absolutely huge population of Haina! While it may be dwarfed by Wellingtons formerly huge pop of 134 (Which the Viking city of Hedeby is close to at 133 last we saw it), 115 isn't something to shake a stick at. In real world population that's 588,781,225 people in that city alone, which is bigger than the entire population of the United States. Wonder what they’re feeding people at this point?</p><p>Coiot: Here is the moment from the video (excuse the graphics): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fggOVaCoFCCqMcl2kju-hJOidxeZCwbs</p>"

  scene_title: "I Could Make You Care"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Azcapotzalco falls to yellow as the gigantic Haidan navy punishes the Apache attack on their southern border. This hurts to see as an Apache fan, as if the city falls there won't be much in the nearby area to take it back with. In my opinion this attack was ill timed on the Apache’s part, as there is no way the Apache can even hope to bring enough of a force for a good defense and a cohesive offense at the same time.</p>"

  scene_title: "I Hear You Knocking"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Haidan forces fight to defend lands that have belonged to the Haida for thousands of years at this point, and for many of the fake soldiers, their homes. But while it's a valiant one, the cities are closer to the Shikoku core, and Haida is sitting at 109 techs and 3791 hammers to Shikoku’s 122 techs and whopping 9244 hammer, and are thus doomed to fall in a short while. </p>"

  scene_title: "Return To Sender"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Haida tries to make a surge towards the Shikokan Home Islands, but faces a more technologically strong fleet tasked with the job of stopping such a feat. Haida do have the numerical advantage by sending 15 ships, and while that may be short of enough to capture a city, it does open a corridor of attack that they can focus on.</p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "Happy Trails Expedition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>The first North American Haida city falls, and to my shock it's not a coastal one. In a war where Haida’s main weapon is their massive fleet, the loss of an inland city such as Qerrulliik is a massive blow. For Shikoku though, the gain of this city means easy reinforcement and allows for the Shikokan army to join the battle and put pressure on every front that Haida has now. If the Haida want to regain the defensive momentum they’ll need to recapture this city A.S.A.P.</p>"

  scene_title: "My Kind of Town"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Skedan falls next to the forces of the Kamchatka offensive by Shikoku, and while the city might be recaptured by the Haidan, the chances aren't great. Even if it is recaptured, the main focus of the next push will likely be the major city of Fuzhou, which will truly be the death blow to Haida power in East Asia if it falls to Shikoku.</p>"

  scene_title: "When Visitors Attack!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Azcapotzalco is now ready for capture and is luckily protected by a light fleet of peacekeepers, just as Geronimo begins to organize an army to defend the city from the Haida naval assault. Something that is concerning to this Apache fan is that the Haida have complete control of the seas over here, which will mean that the Apache are more than likely alone in this fight against the Haida than they realize. Because while Shikoku is more than fine fighting the Haida by themselves, the Apache aren't.</p>"

  scene_title: "Classic Inspiration"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the peaceful lands of central Shikoku and I notice that they have 2 huge cities (Kochi seems to also be freaking huge, with 115 pop), and these cities are actually safe from all forms of combat it seems. This will be beneficial for their war effort since their production centers should remain safe from any type of retribution from Haida.</p>"

  scene_title: "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>A quick look at the Hawaiian theater shows that Shikoku is mopping up the very last bit of Haidan resistance, and are most likely on their way to begin an offensive against the California coast. The more fronts that get closed will only make things worse for the Haida, and better for the Apache to not lose their coastal cities...Hopefully. Look I’m an Apache fan, I have to make up lies for myself until Endgame shows up.</p>"

  scene_title: "A Valuable Lesson"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>And now we see just how strategic Qerrulliik really is, as it's close to the former Yu’pik capital of Nugtaq. But also in this shot we see that Shikoku has been bombing Haida cities quite well, as well as the remnants of the Haidan air force trying to desperately hold off their opposites flying Shikoku colors. </p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Side Bets"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Haida try to regain positive public opinion with their own citizens by taking Azcapotzalco from the Apache. My own bias aside, this was a bad idea for the Haida. Geronimo wouldn't be able to fully take Sirenik as long as Haida left a token force to guard it, and that fleet needs to be meeting Shikoku’s at Hawaii and other locations in the upper Pacific. </p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "There Stands the Grass"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Fuzhou has fallen, all but truly securing Shikokan control of Kamchatka. While I hate to sound melodramatic, the more this goes on, and the more cities Ryoma takes, the more likely this won't stop until the Haida are a rump on the same scale as the Yu’pik. But that's if I’m allowed to be melodramatic.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the lesser of the 3 remaining South American civs, the Nazca. And we see them with their huge population situated in Cahuachi (which is right next to the border with Uruguay).</p><p></p><p>Off screen, Maratha and Kazakhs declare war on the Qin! Also, Australia and the Khamugs gang up on Tonga. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Launch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Holy Moly, this is huge news. Shikoku has also declared war on the Qin, thus creating a second front for themselves. I’ve gotten this info from Blue Cassette, so this is some trustworthy info. </p><p></p><p>While this may seem like a bad idea in some regards, this may pay off for Ryoma. Lets keep in mind that the war against the Haida is mainly naval, with some efforts from the Shikokan Air Force (S.A.F.). But the Army has had nothing to do, so if Shikoku can use their air force to the same devastating level as they have against the Haida again, they could take some land from the Qin, who are just recovering from their war with the Khamugs. This may be a bet that I take to Vegas, and make it in Shikoku’s favor.</p>"

  scene_title: "Gathering Storms"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Down south we see the benefit of having a large and strong air force as all 3 (possibly 4) Qin cities fully visible in this image are sitting at 0 health and just waiting to flip to grey and white. In all honesty, this will be the weakest part of Shikoku’s assault on the Qin, as if they don't flip these cities in a turn or 2 after this, they won't be able to keep the city they have here. Even on the naval front it will take time to grind down the Qin units on the sea, and will buy the Qin much needed and crucial time.</p><p></p><p>Also on this turn the Qin and Prussia declare war on the Haida, Zimbabwe and New Zealand makes peace, and in a very important peace deal, Prussia and Venice end their fighting. It seems to me that Prussia has kept everything, and that amazing Prussian Defensive standard has been upheld.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Iroquois have finally kicked the Vikings out of Greenland by taking Vasterås. And from what info I’ve been given, that this was the last flip in the war as both of the combatants have signed a peace treaty. </p><p></p><p>This war has just been devastating to the Vikings, as they have lost a lot of units, their cities in Greenland, as well as seen flips in the British Isles. This war may very well be the showing of what will happen when the Sami declare war against the Vikings, as good defense doesn't matter when the enemy isn't afraid of losing thousands of soldiers to accomplish one goal.</p>"

  scene_title: "You’ll Know it When it Happens"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Haida has used what it can to recapture Fuzhou, decimating its population and somewhat strategically ruining the city for Shikoku. While good in my opinion, this will only buy Haida a few more moments, as this city and its northern neighbor are only moments away from falling. But we should commend Koyah on this strategic move, as it buys him a bit more time.</p>"

  scene_title: "One for My Baby"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>And we see more of the effect that the S.A.F. has had on the nearby cities, as Nanzheng and Hangzhou are both bombed into the black, and all that it will take is a melee ship to just get in and take it for the Qin to be wrecked here. These cities were safe from the Qin-Khamug war, and are thus crucial to the Qin war effort, so these cannot fall if the Qin hope to win this war.  But what I expect to see is what happened the last time Shikoku declared war on the Qin, which is these cities flip nonstop, but they will ultimately be safe from the Shikokan army.</p>"

  scene_title: "Run Goodsprings Run"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see that the Vikings are back to trying to restore their rule on the island of Onchan, and do so by bringing a longship in to remind the citizens that they are more Viking than they are Manx. Kinda crazy to see a ship that old still out and about.</p><p></p><p>In other news; the Iroquois, Palmyra, and Uruguay DoW the Haida. This means that rogue units like the paratrooper seen on screen here are doomed to die a horrible death, but also that international pressure is strong against the Haida. This could bring the Metis in on the fun, and maybe even the Yu’pik if war seems advantageous. </p>"

  narration: "<p>In a shocking turn of events for the citizens of Kochi, the city has been nuked. While I don’t have any official info on who sent the missile out, my guess would be the Qin. This will hamper the Shikokan war effort, but it will only open up the use of such weapons against the Qin. For those that love watching nukes being dropped are probably loving this part so far and it will probably only get spicier as the part goes on.</p><p></p><p>In the background, Nazca and Selk’nam make peace, while Beta Israel, Taungoo and India join the international coalition against Haida.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On a front that I didn't even realize existed/mattered, the Kazakhs actually gained a city. Up in the frigid north, Ablai Khan has gained the city of Nadym for the simple cost of maybe being nuked down south. But that's a maybe, and this is for sure, and that’s a bet anyone would take.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shikoku while taking heavy hits on their capital are close to seeing a huge pay off in Alaska, as Kassigluq, Tanu, and Niugtaq are primed to fall to the grey and white. While not huge or overly helpful cities for the Haida, they need every city to last as long as they can so they can use the overly nukey Qin to start grinding down Shikoku. </p>"

  scene_title: "Gone Fishin’"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see a massive Shikokuan fleet that was used to take the single island of Cha’atl. Why this fleet hasn't moved West or Eastward to help in the fight boggles my mind, but when asked, the Fleets PR advisor said that the Admiral and high ranking officers  had “Gone Fishin”. What this means in real terms though is that the Southern Haida fleet will sit useless and the Qin may have a shot at holding their coasts.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>We move back to the Alaskan front as Shikoku moves ever closer to taking this vital part of the Haidan Imperial Confederation, What with melee units being stationed outside of Ickyshoe (Cumshewa) and Nugget (Nugtaq). Also of note is Shikoku has taken control of Qerrulliik. This is important as this allows them to begin pumping out units over here, or begin creating airports (or the future worlds version) to move units about quickly.</p>"

  scene_title: "Chaos In Zion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>In even more shocking and bizarre news, Kochi is now down to 3 population. The amount of nuclear weapons sent at the Shikokuan capital is probably a small amount in comparison to what's left, but it shows that if you do go to war, make sure your core is safe. </p><p></p><p>If this was a real world scenario, the central government probably moved over to Nakamura or Tosa-Shimizu to escape the carnage, So all the extra bombs have done nothing but kill innocent civilians.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Haida have committed the ultimate sin, as they have given a forward operating base to the Iroquois, and at a very strategic flank on the Apache. Damn you Koyah and your failure to defend effectively. </p><p></p><p>In all seriousness, This just goes to show just how powerful the X-com unit is, and just how powerful the Iroquois have become, and are understandably deserving of their continuous 1st spot in the Power Rankings.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And here we see another thing to be envious of the Iroquois for, their leader has basically Jeff Bezos levels of stupid wealth at his disposal. 2 other notable items about this list is that the leader of Shikoku, Ryoma, is on here. All that money would be more useful buying up units to help take on the Qin my guy! Also the fact that world juggernaut and basically Snorlax cosplayer Uruguay isn't in this top 8, which is quite shocking given they’ve been a major player since the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>One last thing on this slide I want everyone to look at is the background of this image, in which we see that Shikoku has taken the 3 islands of Kayung, Atewaas, and Imangaq. This will just give Shikoku even more control of the Pacific, but this likely won't mean much in the long term.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Veni, Veni, Vici"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode36-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>I may have no confirmation, but it looks like Shikoku may have peaced out with the Haida, based solely on the fact that Shikoku is allowing Haida cities to be in the Yellow, and also the fact that there are no Shikokuan units violating Haidan waters. This is huge as this allows for Shikoku to focus all of its efforts on the failing Western front. If this is peace then that means that Shikoku has effectively proved itself against a legitimate neighbor, not one who was always far weaker than themselves.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While the Haida may now have their biggest front shutting down, they still have to deal with other major powers like Taungoo, Apache, Uruguay, and of course the Iroquois, what with their peacekeepers and bombers.As we can already see the Haida are mounting an attack to regain the city of Azcapotzalco, but this may be futile as it could be flipping as long as the Iroquois has an xcom ready to flip the city or the apache can get through. So while Koyah may have made a major diplomatic move, they still have a while to go before they are back in the clear.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the true damage that the Qin have caused to the Shikokuan core,as Kochi has only gained 1 pop since we last saw it, and we see that who needs Super ships when you can just spam hover tanks. It seems that the Shikokuan navy has been struggling holding back the Hover Hoard.

On one occasion facing off against the rising power of Oceania at the time in New Zealand and winning, or building a Military strong enough that it threatened any of its neighbors if timed properly, or their clocks that only had “tonga time” as the hand positions on it. But whatever the case, their death did not come from New Zealand, who many thought would cause it, but by a resurgent Australia.

This part saw the first nukes being used, saw the ruination of the Haida, the possible crippling of Shikoku, and the death of a meme. With such an eventful part, I say au revoir, and this is Sir_Brendan signing off. </p>"
