description: 'As the Cylinder completes its first rotations, the tensions between our
  combatants are stretched to breaking point and the first conflicts break out on
  every continent. With new settlements popping up constantly, and new religions for
  their populace to follow, which of the 61 civilisations will emerge most powerful
  as the game starts in earnest?'

  narration: "<p>Would you believe it? It’s Part 2 of the CBRX already! It seems like
    only last week when we were gifted with the first part of this new season, and
    while it certainly whetted the appetite, things are about to get spicy and substantial.
    We’ll be seeing wars, religions and soon-to-be infamous settles, I’m sure. This
    is Lacsirax Ariscal, power ranker, cartographer and fan since Mk. 1. Let’s get
    stuck in.</p><p>Coiot‘note: This episode's cover comes to us by Jru, who makes a sudden reappearance on the sub. Warm Greetings.</p>"

    of information for Babylonians everywhere. Hats off to HandaNauka for this curious
    look into the world of the shivering watchers, waiting for their sub to be delivered.

  narration: '<p>Our first map of the week is DerErlenKonig’s tile-accurate map, which clearly shows a number of civs sitting pretty on their first two cities alone. Here’s hoping we see more civs grow outward this part, joining the likes of Songhai, Selk’nam and Zimbabwe.

  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>With a lacklustre start from the Kazakhs, who led the PRs in Part
    0, we awarded pole position to Zimbabwe this time round. Not only did they found
    four cities to nearby Ndongo’s two, they came top in this week’s production rankings,
    probably the most important ranking outside of military. We’ll be keeping a close
    eye on them this part. Speaking of which, that’s quite enough waffle...</p>"

  scene_title: Home on the Prairie
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We start in the Canadian prairies, where the Métis (pronounced Matey)
    have churned out three cities and have two more settlers on the go. They’re all
    fairly conservative settles - no wild provocative expansions yet. But with the
    land to the north becoming increasingly icy, Louis Riel will have to look south
    if he wants his people to thrive in the parts to come. Squint hard and you’ll
    see a wonder being built in Batoche - is that the Statue of Zeus or the Temple
    of Artemis? Both are useful!</p>"

  scene_title: Heroes of Legend
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>In Central Asia, Mithridates of Persia has enrolled one of the cylinder’s
    first Great Generals, though we’re not sure of his name - it is the Ancient Era,
    I guess no one’s writing history down yet. He’s already got a fine army behind
    him, though. More to the point, he has an army; whichever Great General’s sitting
    in the Seljuq capital of Isfahan seems to have forgotten that crucial part of
    military science. We worried the Seljuqs would get boxed in fairly early, and
    India’s cheeky chokepoint city Allahabad seems to have done the trick already.</p>"

  scene_title: The War of Niagara Falls
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Canada link their disparate second settle of Montréal with a more
    reasonable Toronto, and are immediately punished by an Iroquois invasion. Mr King
    will have to stave off one of the largest armies of the ancient world, but I’ve
    a sneaking suspicion those huge lakes and waterfalls between them should help.
    The Métis look on from their brand new city of Fort Garry, not yet ready to pick
    a side.</p>"
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Pink v Purple
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>But that’s not the only war this turn brings, as Nepal make good
    on the promise of an aggressive forward settle with an even more aggressive declaration
    of war. India has been neglecting their military, but might be able to stave off
    the Nepalese invaders for long enough to force a stalemate. It’ll be a close one,
    and either way Maratha will have cause to celebrate, already sending another settler
    north underneath their arguing neighbours’ noses.</p><p></p><p>Now is probably
    a good time to mention that some of the shots this part will seem a little off-centre
    and strangely framed. This is due to the way in which the first few turns were
    played and filmed, but from next part onwards it gets fixed, so fret not!</p>"
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: A Truly Blessed Image
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well this is something. Lowest-ranked Haiti, who usually struggle
    to settle outside their tiny home island, have only gone and plonked a city on
    Venezuela’s doorstep! It’s actually a nice settle too, surrounded by rivers and
    placed on a hill for maximum defence. Of course, a better defence would be any
    sort of army, and Venezuela already look primed for a quick conquest. If I was
    being generous, I’d say this city was bait - after all, Chavez hasn’t built any
    naval units yet, so Haiti could sweep in and attack Caracas from the sea while
    he was distracted. That’s a pretty charitable reading, though.</p>"
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Chauchillin’
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Nazca tend to play protective and conservative, so the Temple
    of Artemis should come in handy for them, with that growth bonus and ranged unit
    production buff. There’s a settler on the verge of staking a claim on the Amazon,
    too. You’ll remember in Mk 2 that cities founded there are incredibly hard to
    take in the early game, so while exposed it shouldn’t be impossible for Cahuachi
    to hold onto it.</p>"
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Yongcheng & Yangcheng
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s a tale of two cities as the Qin attackers around Yongcheng encroach
    on the Xia capital Yangcheng. In fact, it’s the first city we’ve seen take damage
    in CBRX history. Both Chinas have recently settled another city to the south,
    so even if a city should fall they both have bases to bounce back from. The Khamugs
    were spotted roaming south as well last part, and it looks like they’re sending
    another settler to join the party. In my professional opinion they should probably
    focus on reinforcing their core first, but who am I to argue with a Khan?</p>"
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Target Practice
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>We also see Delhi take damage - a troublesome sight for Indira and
    her ministers, but they look more equipped to deal with the damage than Xia. It
    helps that Nepal’s archers are apparently engaged in training exercises in the
    forests south of the Ganges. Prithvi has instead sent a settler to the front line
    - Nepal are still only sitting on two cities, and if they throw away their only
    settler, they may stay this small for some time.</p>"
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: The Peaceful Provinces
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our first shot this part of PR leaders Zimbabwe, and they’ve added
    a fifth city to their empire, the first contender to do so. The stats tell us
    they do have an army, but it’s nowhere to be seen here - perhaps it’s marching
    on Ndongo already? Alas, we just don’t know. South Africa has some of the most
    productive land on the cylinder, with plenty of useful resources, so we may be
    seeing a more evenly fielded army from them in the future.</p>"
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: How Syr Daryou?!
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>From our current #1s to our previous champs, the Kazakhs, who had
    a timid Part 1. They seem to be overcompensating this part, with two new cities
    already - one of these, Almaty, placed frighteningly close to Parthia’s Hecatompylos
    (the other one, Sauran, is hiding just north of this scene). The Kazakhs may have
    little-to-no army ready to defend it, but Parthia is hardly overflowing with soldiers
    either, so either side will probably want to wait a while before exchanging blows.
    Is it a smart move for the Kazakh king Ablai Khan, or will he be the one left
    smarting?</p>"
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Feeling Nile-hilistic.
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Minoa face a somewhat predictable war from Nubia, who are themselves
    still lacking a third city or settler. They’ve started mass producing their unique
    archer replacement though, which gains extra movement when near a river. You know,
    like that huge one running through the middle of Nubia. Unfortunately for Minoa,
    they did bring some warriors along for the ride, and Phaistos looks unilaterally
    doomed. Minoa do have another settler waiting to replace the city should the worst
    come to pass - now hopefully they remember how to move it. Libya hover around
    Cyrenaica, whistling awkwardly.</p>"
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Friday I’m At War
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Presumably Alaric of the Goths took one look at the unprotected,
    feeble and easily accessible lands of Muscovy and figured it wasn’t nearly enough
    of a challenge. No, Alaric only plays Guitar Hero on expert and he only goes to
    war with worthy rivals. This time he’s picked Tokhtamysh and the Golden Horde.
    And to be fair, while the Golden Horde are certainly fielding more forces than
    Ivan the Truly Terrible, it still pales in comparison to the Gothic masses. I
    hope Tokhtamysh likes The Cure...</p>"
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Toussaint Gonayiv It To Ya
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kuikuro are notorious forest fortresses; they can build improvements
    without chopping down the surrounding woods, meaning they preserve those stellar
    defence bonuses for most of the game. Still, it looks like Venezuela are sending
    a recon mission to assess the situation - Mr. Chavez, Gonayiv is right there and
    still unprotected, I’m not sure this is a priority right now! The Nazca settle
    on Estaquería for the name of their new Amazonian paradise.</p>"
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: O Halloo Nyn Ghooie!
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well, what do you know, my favourite civ in the game! No, not that
    one… and, no not the one in Scandinavia either… it’s the Isle of Man, of course!
    We Menn and Womenn are hardy people, possibly even foolhardy for thinking we can
    play ball with the big boys and girls. But we do have one thing going for us -
    Castletown is the first city we’ve seen to have a population in the double digits.
    11 people - which is nearly as many as the population of the real life Isle of
    Man. Scotland don’t exactly look threatening, as they seem less interested in
    soldiers and more invested in “trading”, whatever that means. In the corner, the
    Vikings look to populate their home-fjords a little more.</p>"
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Two Turtles
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now we have two civs apparently allergic to third cities. It’s not
    surprising in the case of Poverty Point, who tend to like playing tall. Their
    army’s on the move north, though the destination is currently unclear. It’s more
    alarming that the Iroquois still aren’t in city-spam mode - they’re infamous among
    Civ V players for being unstoppably expansive, but there was always a worry they’d
    get bogged down by feuds with the Canadians upstairs, a war which has not yet
    progressed any further.</p>"
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Fights at Phaistos
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>One war that’s progressing just fine is Nubia’s attack on Phaistos
    - indeed, we could be about to witness the first city capture of the game, in
    Part 2 no less! Fortunately for Minoa, Nubia haven’t yet built a navy, on account
    of not yet having any coastal cities, so Minos might be able to flip it back.
    He also has his eyes on Greece, an area neglected by the European civs thus far.
    Libya stop whistling and settle Derna.</p>"
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: The Sleepy South
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>The other pale blue civ who were destined for great things only to
    disappoint in Part 1, it’s Uruguay! As with the Kazakhs they’ve started to make
    good on their copious amounts of space and have squeezed another city out, with
    a settler in Salto ready to add to the roster. I’m also just now realising how
    many resources I added in the Andes. Possibly overkill. In any case, Uruguay are
    sticking to the Paraná basin for now. That Haitian scout has travelled a long
    way from home.</p>"
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: A Fearsome Pharos
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of Uruguay, that exclamation mark tells us they’ve just
    changed party, from Colorados to Blancos. That will give them healthy bonuses
    to production and military, as well as a more aggressive AI. Approach with caution.</p><p></p><p>Back
    to the action in front of us, and we can see that the plucky Menn of Mann just
    bagged a wonder! It’s a brilliant one for them too, the Great Lighthouse, which
    grants better movement and sight for the armada they’ll soon construct. Of course,
    if they plan on keeping Douglas they could probably do with a boring land army
    too. The Holy Roman Empire are archer addicts, with just one warrior among their
    ranks. Their current leader Bismarck should look to negate that imbalance - they’ll
    not be conquering anything as it stands.</p>"
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Yin and Yangcheng
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yangcheng is the first capital to fall to the red, but Xia might
    have found a lifeline - they seem to have dispatched all the nearby warriors,
    leaving Qin Shi Huang’s nearest melee unit a few turns away. On the other hand,
    there are enough archers nearby to make sure that Yangcheng’s population stays
    in the red for some time - possibly even long enough for the Qin’s hit squad to
    arrive. To the north, the Qing army appears on the move. Are they going to kick
    the Xia while they’re down, or do they have a juicier, greyer target?</p>"
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: It’s a Cat-Ostrav-e!
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The PR team ranked the Czech Republic 12th this week. I ranked them
    8th. One ranker put them 3rd! Yet now they look desperate, with no army to speak
    of and the Ottomans glaring down on the city of Ostrava… Yes, that’s an Ottoman
    declaration of war, I’m not sure why the alpha’s colour is different. Mehmed II
    also planted Edirne in Moldavia, making his focus on Europe ever more obvious.
    He’s still ignored Greece though, and the Minoan settler is really on a journey
    north now. And say, what’s that Palmyrene army doing? Could Zenobia have struck
    a deal with Czechia?</p>"
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Aztec Shamera
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Aztecs have their vanilla unique unit, the Jaguar Warrior, but
    are otherwise looking pretty dismal, settling a conservative third city that seems
    designed to be as unthreatening as possible. It’s a wasted opportunity, as the
    Apache are also looking pretty quiet themselves, seemingly placing Tsokanende
    in an attempt to block Poverty Point from settling any further west - not that
    Poverty Point look like they want to settle anywhere.</p>"
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: The First Fall of Many
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>What’s that sound? Is that the screams of thousands of innocents
    watching their homes being burnt to a crisp for the first time in history? I think
    it is! Nubia capture Phaistos, nabbing the coveted trophy for First City Capture.
    That said, the less coveted trophy for Second City Capture might go to Minoa,
    as they’ve an archer and a couple of triremes in prime position to retake their
    second city. Sadly for us Crete crazies, Nubia still have the upper hand, and
    it looks like the city’s palatial labyrinth will be converted into a pyramid soon
    enough. Eagle-eyed viewers will see Palmyra finally field another settler.</p>"
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Gobekli Tepid
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>By now some of you may have noticed the two unfamiliar pictures in
    the notifications bar. The CBRX has around 20 brand new custom wonders added to
    the mix, courtesy of Pouakai. The first of the pair is Gobekli Tepe, an archaeological
    site in Turkey, and one of the oldest known man-made structures in existence.
    And it’s been built by the otherwise quiet Sulu! An excellent choice, they’ll
    be sure to make good use of the… +3 faith and +2 faith bonus on stone and marble.
    Oh. Well, at least they have another settler on the go.</p>"
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Can You Barbeque Rice?
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The second wonder here is considerably more useful; the Banaue Rice
    Terraces, found in our world’s Philippines, gives +1 food to all hill tiles in
    the city it was constructed. It’s Australia who have built that one, and presuming
    they built it in their capital Canberra, that could really help them out with
    early game growth - they evidently need it, looking at the measly 4 population
    the city holds now. In the foreground, New Zealand appear to be stagnating after
    a quick and expansive start. They’d do well to get a decent navy off the ground
    (ha) as soon as possible.</p>"
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Library of Heaven
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another turn, another wonder, this one a lot more familiar; the Qing
    have built the Great Library in Beijing. They’re already cultural powerhouses
    thanks to their uniques, so a science bonus on top of that is very natty. It can’t
    help them expand though - incredibly, for a civ that are usually one of the first
    to five cities, they’ve only just managed a third city and don’t have any other
    settlers on the go (that new city’s just out of shot, south of the Yellow Sea).
    Instead, Korea look to take advantage of the open Manchurian expanse. They’re
    an underdog in this competition, but so far Seonjo’s not put a foot wrong.</p>"
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Putting Havel in Czech
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Striking on a moment of weakness, both German-speaking civs declare
    war on Havel’s Czech Republic, with HRE even founding Augsburg a short distance
    from Prague to prepare. Granted, neither they nor Prussia look too committed to
    this fight - they’re probably only doing this to get into the Ottomans’ good books.
    Czechia settle Plzen in a place that would be very difficult for them to defend
    but very easy for Prussia to defend in the future, if they actually engage in
    this war and take the city. In the sidebar we can see one civ has taken Havel’s
    side; Palmyra has declared war on the Ottomans.</p>"
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Goths Don’t Cry
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Goths descend on Sarai Batu, scratching the city walls, though
    Tokhtamysh by now has summoned together a decent collection of archers ready to
    give their lives for their capital. But Alaric, the absolute madman, has an elicit
    flanking force approaching from the southwest! Just because you’re a barbarian,
    doesn’t mean you don’t apply basic military tactics. That said, there’s one very
    Civ-specific tactic he might have overlooked: you do need to bring along a melee
    unit if you actually want to capture the city. Meanwhile, Muscovy are wiping the
    sweat off their foreheads and toasting their close shave.</p>"

  scene_title: I Went to Cordoba Couple of Months Ago, It’s Nice
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Have all these wars and wonders worn you out? Take a breather with
    Algeria, whose sole contribution to the game thus far is the weirdly named city
    of Mascara. Abdelkader’s eyes are surely on FLEEK. To the north, the Moors have
    founded another city, Mursiyyah. The public poll ranked these guys in the top
    5. I honestly don’t understand why, but currently they at least seem pretty carefree.</p>"
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Drake Can’t Save You This Time
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s all kicking off in the sidebar, but let’s focus on what’s in
    front of us at the moment: Canada. If the Iroquois ever mounted a serious attack
    on them, it’s evaporated. But what’s that in Indiana, a Poverty Point army? And
    one that’s apparently taking damage? Take my word for it: Poverty Point have declared
    war on Canada, sending a decent force to Montréal. This is pretty disastrous for
    Canada, who have neglected defending that outpost in order to stem the pithy Iroquois
    assaults. But it’s also a fairly strange move for Poverty Point, who could surely
    have pounced on the under-protected Apache instead - a more pressing threat, one
    would think. Here’s hoping Tahera can see the wood for the trees and doesn’t get
    caught off-guard.</p>"

  scene_title: Yin and Shang?
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yangcheng has fallen! I repeat, Yangcheng has fallen! It’s only turn
    39 but our first capital is already down - whatsmore, there’s no way Xia are taking
    that back any time soon. Did I say Xia? Because I of course mean Shang, as the
    loss of their capital means they have now entered a new dynastic cycle, gaining
    a minor science bonus and a brand new dynastic capital - Yin, which you may remember
    was called Chu before. It’s a very cool mechanic, but we might not get a chance
    to see it used again! In any case the obvious focus for the Qin is now Qiongshi,
    with Yin being marginally more protected.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, that seems to be
    everything in this scene, moving along… no, of course not, you’ve all seen it.
    The Khamugs settle Ba’arin down near Shanghai. And honestly, it looks pretty defensible
    from land, distant enough from its neighbours that I doubt anyone will bother
    it for a while. On the other hand, the moment Shikoku or Korea send a navy its
    way, it’s toast. What’s a CBR without some bonkers settles though? Kudos to Khamugs
    for kicking us off.</p>"

  scene_title: Fighting the Real Fight
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>India and Nepal wisely agree to stop their futile fistfight with
    immediate effect. No, they should band together to focus on the real threat -
    those dastardly Marathi. The newly built city of Sangameshwar will be a tough
    nut to crack with its protective mountain, but either Indira or Prithvi could
    have a good stab at Satara or Pune. Nepal also look to settle Bengal, but not
    if Taungoo get there first.</p>"

    taiga, with a special shoutout going to the citizens of Baykit - when making the
    Google Map for Part 1, I realized Baykit is placed perfectly on its IRL counterpart,
    a very small village. And hey, I was right about them getting a religion too!
    Two points to me so far. Anyway, the Evenks might not be lonely for long - looks
    like the Khamugs are headed north, and given how far south they ventured earlier
    this part, who knows where they could end up? The North Pole? The Moon?</p>"

  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene75.jpg
  narration: "<p>Alas, Poverty Point might have bitten off more than they can chew,
    as their army around Toronto has dissolved. Oh well, they still made a solid gain
    from this war, and in even better news for them it appears the Apache army hanging
    around their western borders has scattered somewhat, with just one warrior spotted
    heading north towards the Métis, who may or may not have realised there are other
    people in the game by now. Canada, apparently untroubled by the loss of Montréal
    (which was always an ambitious settle anyway) build another settler in their capital.</p>"

  scene_title: A Strange Status Quo
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene76.jpg
  narration: "<p>The only real action visible in this scene is Ostrava continuing
    to be hammered right at the bottom there, but if I think too much about that it’ll
    get humid again, so let’s focus on these new settles instead. I say new, but I
    spotted that Muscovite city on the minimap a while back. Now we can get a good
    look at it, I can safely say that… yeah, that’s Gothic whenever Alaric wants it.
    Muscovy is still allergic to armies, apparently avoiding conquest through brilliant
    diplomacy alone. Prussia found Potsdam, and in doing so look worryingly like Mk.
    2 Poland at their peak. Still, Frederick’s family have overperformed so far, and
    while they don’t look concerned with continuing the Czech invasion, they don’t
    seem at any current risk either.</p>"

  scene_title: And Then There Were Boats
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene77.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hang on, where did all that come from? No one on the Cylinder seems
    to have built a convincing navy yet - no one except Sakamoto Ryoma, that is. Shikoku
    also boast a newish city in Nakamura (well, we actually spotted it last part)
    and a very high population in Kochi. Shikoku’s UA, which grants bonus science
    when they land on new landmasses for the first time, complements the early game,
    so hopefully they get a chance to use this newfound power soon.</p>"

  scene_title: Only Parth of the Problem
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene78.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Parthians capture Hamadan! There’s no way Alp Arslan’s getting
    that one back, either - not with two new declarations of war headed his way from
    both Oman and Palmyra. Last time we checked in, Oman didn’t have much in the way
    of an army, but Palmyra could prove very provocative. Still, both Isfahan and
    Merv are in very fortified locations, so don’t assume we’ll see a total Seljuq
    meltdown just yet. Make sure you don’t miss that Indian settler creeping north
    into the Himalayas.</p>"

  scene_title: Sigh… Can’tal
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene79.jpg
  narration: "<p>The war for Phaistos is well and truly over; there aren’t any Minoan
    triremes left at all, and that lone warrior making landfall in the Nile Delta
    has as much a chance of capturing a city as transforming into a Giant Death Robot.
    But Minoa DO settle Gournia in the spot I’d picked out. Almost as if I’d read
    ahead, huh? One thing I’ve definitely only just spotted though: Nubia settle a
    bizarre new city, Kerma, around IRL Cairo. Not coastal, not on a hill, barely
    outside the territory they already own… try harder next time, Piye. Oh hell, I’ve
    just noticed something else! With Kerma and Gournia both settled, there’s no way
    to found the Suez Canal! Can’t you do anything right, Nubia?!</p>"

  scene_title: Ocea-nah
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene80.jpg
  narration: "<p>Murri and Australia put a kibosh on their uneventful war, which doesn’t
    seem to have left either nation much worse for wear. Murri could do to expand
    quickly, but without any settlers on the go I’m not hopeful. New Zealand sit unmenacingly to
    the east. I was firmly not on board the NZ hype train this week that pushed them
    into the top 20, and for once I feel validated; after an admittedly speedy four
    cities last part they don’t seem to have produced anything for the past twenty
    turns.</p>"

  scene_title: Britain Bleeds
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene81.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now, this is more like it! Scotland and the Manx’s war comes even
    sooner than expected. But honestly, despite the fact Scotland declared it, there’s
    no immediate front-runner; with Mann now having two cities up and running in England,
    Scotland’s forces might well split and squander their chances. And while Mann’s
    army is smaller than Scotland’s, it’s also more advanced - they’re fielding some
    of the Cylinder’s first ever spearmen (I would say THE first, but I did see some
    Goths carrying spears a few scenes back). I could see this being a stalemate,
    too. Meanwhile, the HRE have two whole settlers on the go - the race to six is
    ON so long as you don’t look at the minimap too closely.</p><p></p><p>Another
    religion has been founded! Let me pick another from the list… hm… oh, this one’s
    interesting. Sulu found a religion this part, and as you may already know, they’re
    another Sunni Sultanate in real life. So they’ve opted for the Bulgarian heresy
    of Bogomilism! This is a very interesting extinct variant on Christianity which
    celebrated the body as the ultimate temple, and eventually influenced the more
    famous Catharism. It was also the origin of a very, um, English swear word. You
    do the maths.</p>"

  scene_title: Terror del Fuego
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene82.jpg
  narration: "<p>Time for a better look at that dastardly forward settle from Uruguay,
    and a better shot of the Selk’nam world in general. Another civ that were quick
    to four cities, and another civ who now seem reticent to expand further. But they
    do construct one of the greatest wonders of the world, the fierce Statue of Zeus.
    That city capture bonus is spicy, but you can’t capture cities without an army,
    and right now the Selk’nam aren’t boasting much. They do have their UU, the K’mal.
    It’s a cheaper, slightly stronger spearman that can move after attacking - I’m
    not sure how useful those skirmish tactics will be in a full-on invasion, mind.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere,
    Parthia peace out with the Seljuqs, keeping Hamadan. That’s a wise call, as the
    next couple of cities were much better defended - but will they preserve their
    momentum and turn on a preoccupied Kazakhs next? On the other hand, I have no
    idea how many spare kidneys Havel offered to Mehmed to land his Czech Republic
    a peace treaty with the Ottomans, without even conceding Ostrava. A lucky break
    for Czechia, and honestly, a decision that could well come back to bite Mehmed.</p>"

  scene_title: Soarin’ Past Sauran
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene83.jpg
  narration: "<p>I know the last thing of interest here is a new religion, but I am
    honour-bound to tell you that the Qing have founded Confucianism in Beijing. Got
    that? Good. Now looky here! The Kazakhs go to war with the Nenets, and I’m sure
    Mithridates is heaving a huge sigh of relief to know that his gamble with Hecatompylos
    has apparently paid off. The Nenets meanwhile are just happy to get a screenshot.
    By the way, that Nenets UA is a Chariot Archer replacement that can sacrifice
    itself for a big old culture bomb, and can also cross ice. It’s hard to call right
    now, but I think Nyar’yana Marq could potentially be in big trouble.</p>"

  scene_title: The 1590s All Over Again
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene84.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the other exciting war this turn, Shikoku actually use that huge
    navy they’re sporting and assault Korea! I did think Pyongyang was looking awfully
    exposed, and it’s hard to see Seonjo holding onto it for long. And unlike most
    naval attacks, Sakamoto has actually reinforced the area with land troops too,
    possibly preventing the flipfest that these watery wars often turn into. In other
    news: what on earth happened in Qiongshi? Shang looked like an absolute goner
    last time we tuned in, but now its their archers that raze the farms outside their
    former capital. A comeback seems unlikely, but at least they’ve just about clung
    onto life.</p>"

  scene_title: Can the Sahara Desert Really ‘Heat Up’?
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene85.jpg
  narration: "<p>Things have heated up in the Sahel, with a sudden and huge Songhai
    army descending on Constantine. Barring any sudden peace treaty, the city is history
    - and Askia might drag Tlemcen down with it for good measure. We can see injured
    soldiers on the Libyan front, but neither side appears to have made much impact
    on the other up there.</p>"

  scene_title: Yes We Canal
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene86.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another religion? The last one on my list is the Yup’ik, who predictably
    took a religion after building Stonehenge earlier this part. A religion called…
    good luck Dawkinzz… Angakkunngurniq. An-gak-kun-ngur-niq. I’m sure it’s easier
    to pronounce if you speak an Inuit language, it being their word for a kind of
    holy man similar to the Cherokee medicine man. A fitting faith for their icy cousins
    in Alaska. Meanwhile, Venezuela found a new city… ohhhh, a canal city! The Panama
    Canal is actually almost impossible to avoid settling given how loooong Panama
    is. But still, it’s a relief to see it appear after Suez was cancelled a few scenes
    ago. Haiti have spearmen, but I wouldn’t break out the streamers and party poppers
    just yet; their army and navy is still pretty meagre, though Venezuela’s navy
    being non-existent is reassuring for now.</p>"

  scene_title: No Way, Nokugu
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene87.jpg
  narration: "<p>You’ve got to be kidding me… The Kuikuro keep their settler alive
    long enough to found a city right in the midst of Venezuela’s vast armies. Actually,
    said army seems to have retreated, but unless they signed Open Borders I think
    this must be a non-binding ceasefire rather than a fully fledged peace treaty.
    One thing’s for sure - Venezuela blew their shot to take out Gonayiv while it
    would have been a walk in the park. No doubt they could still do it, but Haiti
    would only let it go kicking and screaming now - perhaps enough to scratch Venezuela
    hard enough for a naval assault.</p>"

  scene_title: A Relaxing Wind-Down
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode2-scene88.jpg
  narration: "<p>We close today’s proceedings with a scene of jolly Tonga, who currently
    seem happy to fulfil the same role Hawaii took last time around. They do manage
    a third city in Mu’a, and if you squint you’ll see a Sulu Proa (a faster trireme
    replacement) is paying them a visit. Tonga either go hard or stay home, and at
    the moment we’re definitely getting the latter.</p><p></p><p>That’s all for this
    rundown, but it sure ain’t all there is to see. A squint at the minimap shows
    us too many new cities to run down here, but out of the civs little-seen in this
    part, the Most Improved award has to go to Taungoo, who have settled a decent
    five cities. Incredibly, our largest civs are Songhai and Prussia on 6, while
    Papua, Canada, the Iroquois, the Murri, Scotland, Benin and Beta Israel languish
    on 2. If you want to see all these new settles in action, check out the raw video
    footage that’s posted alongside every part. Other than that, stay tuned for even
    more excitement to come, keep making your batshit OCs, and please riot at every
    single mistake I made. Thanks for reading, see you in the comments!</p>"
