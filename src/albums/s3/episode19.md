title: "Episode 19: Blood In The Water"
narrated_by: "Captain Bohemian & LunarNeedle"
description: "Some civs seem destined to fight in bitter rivalries with their neighbors for centuries. Others seem destined to conquer those unfortunate enough to start near them. Others still have the unique distinction of being able to declare war on a neighbor far away from them and still make it worth watching. Let’s see who’s who."

  narration: "<p>The Vihreaan Map is, as always, quite beautiful. As the empty spaces begin to fill, we get a very clean look at the world. Well, minus that clump of Yugoslavia in Africa. And the Mohave city in Central Asia. And the…you know what, nevermind.</p>"

E_C_H has made it their mission to bring all you fans of history and world cultures something to chew on every so often. Going in alphabetical order, they’ve most recently covered The Comanche and Iron Jacket so that we may continue to love and learn about them even after being eliminated.

  narration: "<p>Ah, North Korea. Number one greatest power in the cylinder! Rumor has it, glorious leader Kim Il-sung has already developed nuclear weapons and will soon be annexing all of Asia in the coming parts! Do not believe Tuvan propaganda; North Korea has ALWAYS been ranked first.</p>"

Don’t be fooled by the fact that Serowe is at half health–I don’t foresee a capture any time soon.</p><p></p><p>I spy two settlers creeping around in Angolan lands. There’s not much prime real estate left in this corner of the world, but I’m sure they’ll be put to good use soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In Oceania, we see a much hotter naval war between Maori and Wiradjuri. Windradyne is on the offensive, having recently evicted Maori from Australia and seeking to continue the fight on Potatau’s home turf. The Wiradjuri navy just north looks like it could quickly sweep up a few cities, but that Incan navy just across the horizon looks a little too intimidating for them to leave their posts just yet.</p>"

Even after wrestling a peace deal out of thin air, Yongle knows his troubles are far from over.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of Ming is the Mori, who have carpeted up quite nicely all things considered.

  narration: "<p>Thanks to the inconveniently-placed borders and ships of The Normans, the Tetouan capital is blocked off from receiving any reinforcements from the Mediterranean Sea. Mali seems like it’s finally got a real chance at taking this capital and ending this North African rivalry once and for all.</p>"

  scene_title: "A Poppy For The Knowing Ones"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Across the cylinder, there exists an idiom: “to ship poppies to Kokang”; the phrase describes a gesture that would be utterly pointless to attempt. However, one merchant on the island of Waitomo took this expression to heart when his business rivals told him to do so as a joke. This merchant was no fool, though–he recognized that the Antarctic colonies of Man Ton Par and Tar Shan lacked the ability to grow their own poppies, and thus realized that there was profit to be made.</p><p></p><p>In real life, Timothy Dexter was an American businessman who would go down in history for performing similar business endeavors that seemed foolish at first glance but held great potential…as well as generally being incredibly eccentric.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Inside Jaxartes, Adolphe Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel perfects his painting style and technique to depict life in Massagetae as realistically as possible. His new painting “Falcon Attacking a Pigeon'' is actually a metaphor for the Permian siege on his home, as the power disparity between the two empires paints a gloomy picture of its own.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Turner Of The Tides"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ted Turner, real-life founder of TNT, TBS, and CNN (among other achievements) finds himself at the front line of the newly-declared war between the Normans and Chad. He’s likely helping to fund the war effort while also ensuring his networks have the best coverage of the conflict. Like it or not, violence equals views, and there’s money to be made from wars.</p><p></p><p>Jokes aside, this war was not a good call for the Normans. They have enough land units to defend Benevento and maybe enough to push into Aouzou, but it will no doubt be a flip fest at best. At worst, however, they stand to be forced into flipping their coastal holdings.</p>"

  narration: "<p>America and Greenland continue their naval skirmishes off the coast of Montpelier while Ethan Allen tries his best to take notes and learn how to build and use a navy effectively. The various soldiers of Vermont go out on the coast for some swimming lessons, but are reminded not to go too far away and get caught in the crossfire of the war going on around them.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Great Awakening"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Gediminas finally remembers that he’s in a battle royale and decides to shift the weight of his army eastward into Vladimir. Normally this is the part where I’d worry that they were dividing up their military too much by actively laying siege to at least four cities in this shot, but honestly I’d be surprised if Vladimir leaves this war with more than half of its current cities. Expect to see Rostov drop by the end of the part.</p>"

  scene_title: "Duck Hunt"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Göktürks snag Dzawadi as they clear the Bering Strait of every duck they can find. Both of the remaining Kwak cities have taken damage, and are liable to fall soon. Tsaxis shouldn’t be much of a problem, but Kalugwis might take a bit more work to finish the job. Considering Kwak’s Hamatsa Dancers outnumber any actual land force by 11 to 3 here, it’s safe to say that there won’t be any flipping going on here.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pacific Power Play"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Last slide showed the declaration of war between Wiradjuri and The Inca, and here we see the beginning of what will undoubtedly be a war that shapes the future of Oceania. Pisac looks like it might be in trouble, but it’s tough to say which way this war will go. Inca suffers from low production in all those Polynesian islands, so it might be difficult for them to quickly deploy units to the front if they are lost.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Nelson Of Down Under"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, Timor-Leste continues to work towards solidifying its Australian holdings in the former Yolngu lands. The Wiradjuri army isn’t exactly the most intimidating at the moment, so it’s likely that these cities will be staying red and yellow for now.</p><p></p><p>Off the coast, Tōgō Heihachirō plots an offensive from the sea to claim the entire Australian continent for Wiradjuri. In real life, he was one of the greatest naval officers in Japanese history. Perhaps on the cylinder he can establish a similar legacy, but “Marshal-Admiral Marquis of Wagga Wagga” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue.</p>"

  scene_title: "Land Of Ire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ireland’s got better ships now, so that means they’ll be back on even footing with Castille and taking Oviedo for themselves again in no time. Heck, I bet this will finally be the drive they need to clean up the rest of the Emerald Isles and establish themselves as the powerhouse I know they can be! Michael Collins is probably plotting an invasion of the Anglo-Dutch, Castille, Brandenburg, and Greenland at the same time right now……What’s that? Denial? I’m not in denial. You’re in denial! Éirinn go Brách!</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>I don’t know about you, but I don’t think having multiple cities surrounded by enemy units without any hope of reinforcement is a good look. Vladimir looks increasingly in danger while Lithuania has never looked better. Honestly, Vsevolod’s best shot at staying alive might actually be to swipe at Perm.</p>"

  scene_title: "Mohave Might"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the naval strength of the Mohave patrolling the western coast, juxtaposed by the Hawaiian outpost of Guiyang looking incredibly vulnerable. Come on, Irataba; if you won’t take the fight to Arapaho, at least get to work on tying up that loose end!</p>"

  scene_title: "Ducking Out"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Göktürks have acquired a taste for duck, and they’re hungry for more. Sadly for them, there’s only one duck left to roast, and his name is Willie Seaweed. With nowhere left to turn, it seems his goose is truly cooked.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>A smattering of settlers search for new lands to claim, but what little there is to go around is quickly being snatched up. Bandar Lampung, the newest Indonesian colony, is barely habitable as it stands–but at least it’s far away from any potential conflict. Even should war with Bengal break out it would most likely not change hands, nor would Goraghat and Sylhet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A wave of Perm’s Batyrs, a UU replacement for knights, rushes to Jaxartes in the hopes to decapitate the Massagetae. To the east, former CBR-contender Ranjit Singh leads the incoming defensive force. Unfortunately for him, this isn’t the same Perm he once knew.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ooh, Burn!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turns out Windradyne is a merciful god, but a demanding one nevertheless. He swipes Te Tokanganui in the Maori peace deal, a city which saw no conflict nearby whatsoever, and is now burning it to the ground. That’s gotta sting for the Maori. It’s also a sign that the Wiradjuri are dealing with some unhappiness problems, which won’t bode well if they intend to take and hold on to any of the cities that Timor-Leste and the Inca currently own in his neighborhood.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yikes. That Kilwa navy could deal some serious damage to the Zulu unless they shape up soon. Right now, Cetshwayo seems more interested in sending workers to guard the coastline.</p><p></p><p>Is it just me, or does Botswana actually have a bigger military than the Zulu here? Not that either side is doing much better here, of course. Still, I can’t help but notice that the borders of Ulundi are technically “the front line” now…</p>"

  scene_title: "Rump vs. Rump"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode19-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Francisco Morazon, tired of being treated like Central America isn’t capable of being a regional power (it isn’t) decides to declare war on the only foe within reach that wouldn’t immediately flatten them: the Seminole. For Micanopy, this is both the most exciting and most scary thing to happen in recent memory. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps Cuscowilla will finally fall, and Central America will finally claim some relevance in this game. Maybe the Seminole will break free from its Florida prison and prove its own relevance again. Personally, I don’t see either side making any major gains or losses in this war, despite the Seminole clearly being outgunned and outmatched. They’ll be a tough nut to crack by sea.</p>"

Won’t be long until he’s got that roast he’s been craving.</p><p></p><p>Willie Seaweed is out of places to fly to. Even his last general has given up hope.

  narration: "<p>The Wiradjuri-Incan war continues, and it’s clear that the former is on the defensive here. Maynggu Ganai and Mayinggu Marragu have both already taken damage, but Tupac seems to be going for the time-dishonored strategy of attacking multiple cities at the same time. We’ll have to wait and see if any cities change hands in this region.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Forget what I said and the start of this part; Serowe is now in prime flipping position. I’d wager Botswana will end with this city, barring any well-timed peace agreements, but hey–I was wrong earlier too. That backdoor fleet will help the Zulu hold on for a bit, but it’s not going to be enough to hold on forever… </p>"

  narration: "<p>André Citroën, renowned French industrialist and founder of the automaker company that bears his name, finds himself in the Mohave exclave of Avi Mota. Unfortunately for him, there are no roads between cities here that could benefit from any automobiles…not to mention they haven’t been invented yet. He’s heard that there’s a settler nearby scouting out land to settle another Mohave city, but they haven’t found enough land that hasn’t already been taken.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A brief glance at Yugoslavia’s Saharan holdings reveal they’re doing just about as well as one would expect two cities in the middle of the Sahara to do. A stiff breeze from any of the immediate neighbors could do irreversible damage and give someone else a leg up in the ever-changing war for African dominance.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With one final, resounding quack, Willie Seaweed exits the game in 53rd place. Bumin Qaghan celebrates by hosting a large dinner banquet with duck as the main course.</p><p></p><p>The Kwakwaka'wakw were nothing short of hilarious, as far as civs go. Despite finishing early, I don’t doubt for a moment that their legacy will continue in the minds of us all. The constant copying-and-pasting of their cool and lengthy name, the funny dancers appearing all over the cylinder, and the overabundance of duck jokes will continue to live on in our hearts. F.</p>"

Idriss Deby decides to go out on a hunt for ducks to bring back home, blissfully unaware that the Göktürks have already eaten them all.</p><p></p><p>Despite this, the people of Chad continue to flex in the general direction of other African civs, hoping they’ll be too intimidated by their large muscles to compete with them.

He recalls that Bau used to be a Kayapo city and notes that the population level still hasn’t fully recovered to what it was under the rule of Raoni.

  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste completes the Red Fort in the city of Ainaro, providing it and all cities in the empire with some nice defensive bonuses. This is a crucial wonder to grab in a battle royale, as it helps when playing defensively and can buy you a turn in a flip fest to hold ground easier. Hopefully, this will be especially useful in Timor’s Australian holdings.</p>"

Unfortunately for the Normans, it seems the rest of their army came to the same conclusion. Aren’t they supposed to be at war with Chad right now? Did their flexing really intimidate them that much?</p>"

  narration: "<p>According to all known laws of Civilization, a boat should not be able to fly. Its sails are too small to get its fat little hull out of the water. The boat, of course, flies anyway because Suharto doesn't care what Sid Meier thinks is impossible.</p><p></p><p>I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but a lot of random civs have been declaring war on Tomyris recently. Perhaps they’re the new Kilwa in that regard—which is funny, because I’m pretty sure Kilwa is one of the other random civs that declared a war on her.</p>"

As per usual, the jungles here are indeed calm…perhaps a bit too calm.

It seems that Aral flipped, but it was a pyrrhic victory at best considering how quickly it all happened.Lavrentiy Beria, Marshal of the Soviet Union in another world, begins hunting down possible spies and Permian sympathizers in Jaxartes with the help of a secret police force under his command. He will not tolerate anything less than the best…but he’ll deal with what he’s got instead.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Michael Collins, having missed the memo about America and Greenland making peace, decides to declare war on both of them at the same time. In any case, this is a great opportunity for him to clean up the Emerald Isles a bit. The wall of Brandenburg cities actually provides a nice defensive buffer for Ireland to deal with the isolated cities of Baltimore and Christianshåb without too much interference from the west. However, they might want to make peace with Castille now before they bite off more than they can chew.</p>"

They really should be focusing more on cleaning the home islands instead of this one city in Brittany, though. As long as the Anglo-Dutch and Brandenburg stay out of this war, they might just make it out of these wars in marginally better shape than when they entered it.</p>"

The border they share is barren for now, but in time I could very easily see these cities changing hands a few times. The rough terrain may slow things down, but I’d wager those mountains will be the dividing line between these two empires if this war goes on for long.</p>"

With only two tiles to be able to attack, Central America might be able to actually win this trade and with a topheavy navy push on a one-tile might actually be able to capture both northern coastal cities. Although I think the amount of unit damage might flip the tide of battle. I think.Regardless, these two low-tier powers have a lot of interesting movement potential. All Carribean major power defenses are stripped from the nearby war with the Seminole. America is overstretched and there’s midtier powers everywhere. If ever there was a zero to hero story.
