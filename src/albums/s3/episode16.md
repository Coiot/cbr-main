Han shows us that quality triumphs over quantity.

This is especially true in the south, where the stalemate is a permanent reality, but the brick wall may be faltering in Kokang’s northwest holdings, where very few units reside.

    narration: "<p>Welp. Last time we saw this region, La Rioja was still standing, now there is nothing but ash and dust. Presumably what happened was, Inca captured the city again, reducing it to 1 pop, and began razing it due to unhappiness (peep their Dark Age in the corner). And of course, a 1 pop city burns in 1 turn. Lacs seems to have captured this screenshot RIGHT as the city vanished, judging by the former borders of the city still being part of Tupac’s lands. </p><p></p><p>Tupac was probably frustrated with his troops getting distracted by two potential targets. And this seems to have been the correct move, as his army is finally making a good run for Tucuman.

    narration: "<p>Turkey, our new #1 and the rulers of Eastern Mediterranean, have recently acquired GALLEONS. That’s right, the Turkish navy is two eras ahead of the Norman navy. Despite Norman numerical superiority, this would absolutely be a one-sided bloodbath. The technological disparity is less obvious on land, but it is there.

In the time since that war, Permians have rebuilt, Afghanistan has settled available space to the south, and the likes of…Kokang and Mohave have settled the available space to the east.

Googling his name only brought up random non-famous people with the same name, until finally I found some weird source, which included the detail that he changes his name to Lars Kovala at some point. Searching for this name brought up nothing on wikipedia besides the articles of a few American Midwestern cities, where he is mentioned as a person from whom land was bought when the city was still new. </p><p></p><p>Anyway, from non-wikipedia sources: He was born in Suomussalmi in Finland, and fled to Alaska during the Finnish Famine of 1866-1868 to be a trader. Alaska was sold to the US in 1867, though, and this coincided with the fur trade drying up, leading Lauri to move on again. This time he headed to California, where he made a fortune selling seal skins. Suddenly rich, Lauri’s next move was to buy up real estate in the Midwest, which is where our scant amounts of wikipedia-sourced information come in. Later in life Lauri would become a philanthropist, and among other things, he was one of the five who donated money to help create the American Red Cross headquarters near the White House.</p><p></p><p>Finland in CBR X3 confirmed !!! </p>"

Not a single good decision was made. The expectation was that Timor-Leste or Kokang would end the silly civ’s story, but Indonesia’s unexpected rise at the Philippines’ expense turned out to be the cause of death. I must admit, this says more about Indonesia than it does about the Philippines. Not many civs on our cylinder have had this kind of stubborn persistence to completely annihilate another contender.
