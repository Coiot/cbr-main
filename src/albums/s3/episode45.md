They only have a small foothold on the mainland while the rest of their cities are on the accursed Japanese archipelago. Facing assaults from both Afghanistan and the dreaded Arapaho, I think Irataba’s likely struggling to hold out past Yemen.</p>"

Servers lined the walls that seemed to extend endlessly.</p><p></p><p>“Ah,” a voice said, “You’re not supposed to be here.”</p><p></p><p>The room suddenly changed back, and Nebuchadnezzar was sitting there, perched on his throne, in front of Semiramis.</p><p></p><p>“Well, Agent S?”</p><p></p><p>What?

She felt like she was about to evaporate if she thought too hard about-</p><p></p><p>“Is something the matter?” Nebuchadnezzar asked.</p><p></p><p>Semiramis was brought back to ‘reality’- whatever that word even meant, anymore. “Yes,” Semiramis spoke, “It’s just that… What if the game doesn’t mean anything anymore? Raoni, Isabella- they know that there’s no endgame. The victory is meaningless, there’s no trophy, and throughout all of this-”</p><p></p><p>It was all fake. That’s what she wanted to say.

Yet, you trusted me with this knowledge regardless…” Nebuchadnezzar leaned against one of the walls of the submarine.</p><p></p><p>“There are many things that even unlimited knowledge cannot know. Is there someone even smarter me, pulling the strings behind even the smallest actions? Who does a god pray to? In the grand scheme of things, does this matter?”</p><p></p><p>“The answer, Agent S,” Nebuchadnezzar smiled, “is ‘Yes.’ Not because we have some predetermined meaning that we fulfill, or anything like that. It has meaning because we give it meaning. God created man so that man may create god.”</p><p></p><p>Agent S stared blankly at the king. “That doesn’t make sense.”</p><p></p><p>“Does it have to? You see it all around you- people create their own truths of the universe. Raoni and Isabella came to the conclusion that this world is built on meaningless conflict. Really, all I’ve done is created a world for mankind to destroy themselves.”</p><p></p><p>-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-</p><p></p><p>In a sudden maneuver, the Arapaho take both Koshoy Korgon and Tashkurghan from the Mohave.

Even if it doesn’t make sense.</p><p></p><p>You wake up to an uncaring world and you’re encouraged to put kindness into it with no expectation of reward. No, rather, it’s because the world is uncaring that one puts kindness into it. The apathetic nature of the universe is neither good nor evil. It is neither ordered or chaotic.</p><p></p><p>“It is what it is, huh?” Semiramis chuckled.</p><p></p><p>-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-</p><p></p><p>Rangpur is captured by Timor-Leste in a strong push towards Afghanistan-controlled India.

If they don’t wish to fight, then that’s up to them. However, until then, I shall let these worlds live their existences… until they, too, crumble.”</p><p></p><p>“That sounds sad,” Semiramis said, “They’re just doomed to fight each other simply… because they can?”</p><p></p><p>Nebuchadnezzar nodded. “But each of these leaders gets a chance to prove themselves once again. For some, it may be a chance to redeem lives they once had. For others, it could be as simple as pursuing goals they never intended.

  narration: "<p>Hey folks, Emu here again to finish out the episode. Now where were we……. Oh, the situation has barely changed since last episode. Great. Anyway, Fred-Willy stands pleased at his generals’ response to the end of the Oranienburg siege, and the fact that he gets to paint a picture of Brandenburger expansion on all fronts is just icing on the cake. It might take a couple thousand years, but that’s fine, he’s got….. A message from Raoni? What could it…. Shit. Nonononono. This can’t be happening. But there’s the proof. He immediately calls for a cybersub to take him to the South Sandwich islands.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a Gaochang bunker, Qaghan has gotten the message too, but for the past few decades he’s been unable to leave his Diomede domain at all. It’s strange, he almost feels like he remembers this ‘Babylon’ mentioned in the invitation, but it’s….. Distant, at best. Of course this didn’t matter at all if he couldn’t actually get to the meeting. Raoni said he’d sent transport, but he didn’t see it yet. Ah, that knock at the door must be it.</p><p></p><p>“So you’re the one who brought himself back from the dead. Care to come down south and clear up how you did it?”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ataturk’s generals in the Far East department were told not to expect an attack anytime soon, so it was fine that all troops under their command were being transferred. Ataturk was of course surprised that Durrani was so eager to keep up appearances even now, but that was to be dealt with later. If there was a later.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Of course, Ataturk was mistaken. Durrani was one of the last world leaders to get the message because of his unusually tumultuous frontiers. But once he got it, even the most ambitious leader on the Cylinder had to hold off a bit. These islands were the last offensive initiative carried out on the orders of any immortal, but the generals kept operating on their own for a little while longer.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Strangely enough, with Ataturk out of command, the African front was doing better than ever. The generals suspected they were being led into some sort of trap, but they just kept getting offered free cities and they just kept taking them. This was certainly exceptionally strange, but after a lifetime of nothing but war you tend to not be too surprised by much.</p>"

He brushes off a report on the state of the war on his way to personally pilot his hyperjet to the Null Island Naval Base. The last Immortal has left for the south, leaving the cylinder in the hands of the people for the first time in history. At least, that’s how the brass sees it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Irataba steps into a briefing room deep in the Antarctic. He was still a little uneasy about leaving a virtual idol of himself to be the figurehead for the country, but this needed his presence in person. As he stepped in, he recognized faces he hadn’t seen in person for over a millennium. Evidently they’d all been here long enough to get over the moment of shock that was now gripping him. A woman in ancient dress stood up. Irataba tried to check his surprise at seeing the dead alive again. “Now that we’re all here….. Welcome to the RIS. We have a lot to cover.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Alright, alright alright….. So there’s a way we can stop them, right? You better tell me there’s a way we can stop them.” Xanana had never fully pondered the idea of losing his empire, and while that usually served an underdog well, it was not spelling good things for his composure here. Raoni sighed. “No. Well, not exactly. But we can run. And I don’t mean to an exoplanet either. We know it can be done, but we’re not entirely sure how. Fortunately, we have Qagan here to enlighten us.”“ME?!?!” </p>"

  narration: "<p>“Yes, we all know I’m great, what’s your point?” A risky remark, but it brought a bit of much-needed levity to a table full of people looking into the fabric of their very existence. “This”, said Raoni with a smile, “is the In Game Editor. It uses Babylonian technology to remake parts of the Cylinder on a massive scale.”</p><p>“Ah,” sighed Xanana in relief, so we can just undo anything the Babylonians do, and we’re good.”“Not exactly. See, they’re planning on using another part of this interface to destroy this world and build a completely new one from scratch. They call it Project Lunar.”“So what’s our move?”“Simple. We make our own.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>“So, let me get this straight…” said an indignant Pretty Nose, “You’re going to clone us like common soldiers?”“You’d think so, but you can’t really clone an immortal, as I’m sure your researchers have told you. We’re cloning the world itself, jumping over to the new one, and leaving the old one to its inevitable fate. The Babylonians will simply make more leaders, I assume. Subtly different from us, but similar enough to satisfy their audience.”“Hold on, hold on, they can MAKE immortals???” interjected an increasingly anxious Xanana.</p><p>“Well, how else do you think we came about?”This silenced him quite effectively.</p><p>“There is, however, a problem.”</p>"
