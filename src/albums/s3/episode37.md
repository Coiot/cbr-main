  narration: "<p>u/zccc delivers to us an intriguing OC for this week, a kill chart of all of the civilizations who have inhabited this iteration of the cylinder. Despite just a few civilizations having a legitimate shot at victory, the elimination chart is quite balanced. Some civs have conquered, been conquered, while others have lived and died without eliminating anyone.</p>"

  narration: "<p>u/vihreaa has created yet another incredible map for our eyes to view, I mean does anyone do it better? (you don’t have to answer that) Jokes aside, it’s so great being able to create something for the community, and especially something where I can create a sense of continuity that I can share with the rest of the community. Here’s to many more maps in the future!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Money makes the world turn, and the same is true for the Cylinder. The amount of work it takes to run a project like this is no joke, and it’s largely thanks to our Ko-Fi donors that we are all able to all enjoy a series like this for free! </p>"

  narration: "<p>Castile is literally the GOAT. Nobody else has ever pull off such a power move as Isabella did, I mean settling right next to the submarine? Incredible. In my headcanon, Isabella travels to the sub on weekends to enjoy mimosas with Nebby while they watch the world be destroyed by the major nations of the world.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 800, and Total War begins. Afghani forces assault the Yemeni city of Tai-22 (that’s a weird name). With little siege equipment or airpower in frame, there are not many direct threats to the city currently, but with no carpet protecting the city, it could be blitzed by another civilization if Yemen isn’t careful.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Did you think I was exaggerating when I said billions would die? The city of Herat has been wiped off the map on the SAME turn Total War was declared. A city that had a population of 40, translates to 30 million people vaporized in nuclear hellfire. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Chad, while they have a solid carpet, it is extremely outdated, with paratroopers and rocket artillery. Needless to say, this carpet will be destroyed relatively quickly. Zaire (like see what I mean here?) Angola’s advanced Future Worlds units (this is me avoiding saying the unit name because I don’t know what they are) approach Chad territory, but will need to cut through their carpet before they can conquer them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste’s African colonies come under siege from Angolan troops, and will likely be captured due to their distance from the main empire and that they are only lightly reinforced with troops. TL may hold on for a while, but with enough dedication of troops from Angola they won’t be able to hold this territory indefinitely.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Bengalese carpet is seen in force in this frame, and while not very modern, still have traces of modern units sprinkled around. Along with this their strong air force will greatly help them on both defense and offense. TL’s cities of Chittagong and San Juan Del Monte take fire, but are not yet under direct threat of being captured.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode37-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite Yugoslavia having units and an airforce, Belgrade is still on red health with Brandeburg troops on their doorstep. The writing is on the wall for Tito, the only question now is how long he will last.</p>"

  narration: "<p>William III, much like Vladimir Putin, learns the downsides of employing forces to defend your territories that do not directly report to you. To be fair, how could he have guessed that the entire world would declare war on each other? In other news, 13 million people just died as Cork was wiped off the map. </p>"

  scene_title: "Saharan Offensive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode37-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mali and Angola are two civs that are a sort of wild card in this war. Neither are at the top of the pecking order, but wield a notable amount of power. Angola controls more territory and production, but has barely any military units in Northern Africa. Mali, meanwhile, has a sizable carpet, which is fairly modern as well. In my opinion, this is one front to keep and eye on in Total War.</p>"

  narration: "<p>TL and the Inca wage war in New Zealand, as the Inca stage an offensive on TL’s holdings on the islands. The Inca’s naval and air power in the region is nothing to be toyed with, and TL should be wary of what could become a major thorn in their backside.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turkey and Tuva share one of the longest land borders on the cylinder, nd the theory of quantity vs. quality will be put to the test. Will Tuva’s brute force in numbers win out? Or will Turkey’s technological superiority win the day?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brandenburg northern holdings come under siege from Tuvan troops, and despite Brandenburg’s air force, they are matched and subsequently outmatched by Tuva. Their only hope is that Tuva’s Ai gets confused by the ocean and fail to mount a good invasion into Scandinavia.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ah… Meat Grinder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode37-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Tuva-Han-Gokturk border is a meat grinder. Units will die, with little territory being exchanged. The Gokturks will lose their isolated cities, but will probably be able to hold a line further to the east.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Isabella continues to live the dream as she essentially is already spectating the game. Being so far removed from the rest of the world and being 100% carpeted, Isabella is actually quite safe, with her only weakness being planes -> paratroopers/XCOMS, or Nexus.

Empires we thought were at the top of the pack are getting outdone by others, and some civs handle Total War better than others. This has been Vihreaa, and if you realized when I wrote the narration for my map you’ll realize that I wrote the entirety of this narration from 3 in the morning to 6 in the morning, and still have to make the map! Hopefully the narration was still entertaining despite this, and see you all next week for another episode of the Civ Battle Royale!</p>"
