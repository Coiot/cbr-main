  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr38-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pretty Nose gets back her rightful place on the top of the rankings. The Arapaho have some crazy stats, a finished tech tree, and several footholds in places they could expand into. It makes me very happy to see that they still had a great come up despite their, uh, stumbling block, when I last narrated. A woman has never won the CBR before, and neither has a Native American, so that's reason enough for me to cheer for Arapaho.   </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>This episode’s first slide takes us to Central Asia, where Afghanistan is desperately defending its western border from Turkey. Lashkargah and Sar-e-Pol have already fallen, while Kabul and Pul-e-Alam look ready to fall. More worryingly though, Kandahar, the Afghan capital, seems like it could fall. Turkey does have fewer land units on the field, but the afghans are on the backfoot. It is quite impressive that Ataturk is still dominating his neighbors on all sides with such a small army.   </p>"

  narration: "<p>Japan, at one point a great melting pot between the many cultures that had come to the island, is now a war-torn wasteland. Despite the massive loss of life and the literal flattening of many cities, the fight continues on. Mohave biotroopers push north in a massive banzai attack, threatening to push the Gokturks all the way to Tashkurgan, a city hastily constructed by the Gokturks to house the many refugees from other destroyed cities. And while the Mohave warriors in their monstrous bug-like biosuits relentlessly attack Gokturk garrison forces, the Han empire launches drone strikes from air bases in Korea. </p><p></p><p>All across the islands of Japan, the native Japanese and Ainu shed endless tears as they watch their homes and culture be trampled by these foreign powers. When a winner is decided and the dust finally settles, will they even remain?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>On a small island off of the Pandyan coast, an intrepid group of Timorese settlers found the city of Ataúro. Tired of the constant war that has engulfed the cylinder, they have come to this island to find peace. They hope hiding here will allow them and their children to live freely and not be conscripted into the meat grinder that is total war. But have they gone far enough away? Just across the water, the Timorese navy lays siege to several Bengali island cities, and Bengal’s last holdout in south India is wracked with unrest. War has touched every corner of the cylinder, to the northern reaches of Siberia to the islands of the antarctic. I doubt that the people of Ataúro will be able to enjoy peace for very long. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Over in East Africa, Yemen has joined the other powers in the area in tearing apart Angola, having taken most of what was once Kilwa and Uganda. I’m not a huge fan of the Yemenis, but they have definitely earned at least my respect from their performance thus far in total war. </p><p></p><p>As for Angola, their army seems to be completely nonexistent. In fact, they have more settlers on the field than combat units! They also have Timor, Mali, and the aforementioned Yemenis bearing down on them. The Angolans clawed their way out of mediocrity in an impressively short time only to completely implode during total war. Brutal stuff.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have our first look at the Americas, where the Arapaho, the Inca, and the Mohave are battling it out in Mexico. Mohave biotroopers make a push for Avi Kwa Ame while the Arapaho simultaneously attack Aha Kwi Nyamasave. The Inca have captured Huukyampve, but their hold on the city looks tenuous at best.</p><p></p><p>At the behest of his advisors, Irataba left his home continent and is now running what is left of his empire from one of his pacific island cities. Despite the obvious need to not fall into Arapaho hands, he hates himself for doing it. He feels like a coward, like he betrayed his people by leaving them to their fate,and letting his home and their home be taken. Even as he looks out from his palace at the beautiful beaches and clear waters of the pacific islands, he can’t help but feel… empty. This isn’t home. This isn’t his beloved Mohave desert. He wants to go home, and he hopes that he can one day, but there is something in the back of his head that tells him that he may never see his Mohave ever again.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Castilian scouts have reported to Isabella that there has been an increase in naval activity close to the miniscule, 3-pop city of Burgos. Alarmed by this news, she and several bodyguards take a trip to the sub and have a talk with Nebuchadnezzar. </p><p></p><p>“What do you want us to do about it?” Nebuchadnezzar asks.</p><p></p><p>“Our technology is not sufficient enough to make a proper show of force to deter these invaders, so, God forgive me for asking this, we ask you to use whatever witchcraft you have here with you to do it for us.” She explains. </p><p></p><p>He sighs. “I’m sorry, Isabella, but we can’t do that. Your settling so close to our sub has already put us in a dangerous position, and that would certainly not make the situation better.” </p><p></p><p>“Grrr.” Isabella starts. “Fine, you keep your devil worship to yourself! A day will come when God will punish you and everyone in this sub!” She continues as she exits through the hallway towards the hatch of the sub, but Nebby cant make out what she is saying. He stays silent for a second, and then turns to Semiramis. </p><p>“You know, I’m sort of going to miss her when this is all over.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hulking Arapaho nexuses cast great shadows over the waters of the Atlantic, slowly moving towards the Kayapo island megalopolises. (Megalopoli? I don’t know.) It seems as though Fusagasuga may fall, but the Arapaho, in their haste to take it, left La Serena completely undefended. After they take Fusagasuga, they might need to double back and retake La Serena. </p><p></p><p>Other than Fusagasuga, (I hope you’re enjoying having to say that so many times) it seems that the Kayapo are still in about the same state as they were going into the total war. For being the sick man of South America, they are doing pretty good for themselves so far. Make no mistake though, this sickness, though slow, will eventually claim them.</p>"

  scene_title: "Red Tide Rolling"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Total war has finally given the Timorese colonial forces in Africa an opportunity to drive north across the Angolan border, and drive they did. They have blitzed all of Angola’s Botswanan holdings and are now pushing into what is left of the Angolan core. Soon enough, they’re gonna border Mali.</p><p></p><p> Angolan high command is in shambles, with nothing but a settler on the field. No one has heard anything from Savimbi either. When will he come out of hiding and try to rally the Angolan people? Will he? Is he even in Angola anymore? All while these questions are asked, the Timorese army gains more and more ground. Angola is not long for this world, I’d say.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turkey Time (?)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timor is the least of Sundiata’s worries right now, though, as the Turks have landed in North Africa and are wreaking havoc. Malian armor, power armor infantry and UAVs are no match for the far more advanced Turkish army. Sundiata needs to close that tech gap and fast if he wants to stay in the game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch general bursts through the door just as William is getting his bob cut finished. </p><p></p><p>“Sir!” He says. </p><p></p><p>“What are you interrupting me for?” William asks, motioning for the barber to stop cutting.</p><p></p><p>“We’re pushing on Berlin. It’s working!” </p><p></p><p>“What?” He says, standing up and knocking the barber’s tools to the floor. </p><p></p><p>“It’s true. The Brandenburgers are putting up little resistance.”</p><p></p><p>“Ha! Fuck you Fredrick!” William laughs. </p><p></p><p>As the two speak, Anglo-Dutch power armor infantry brings Berlin down to the yellow. Not only is Berlin lightly defended, but so is Potsdam. The Anglo-Dutch could certainly take both cities, but they would then have to deal not only with Brandenburg, but also with the Turkish army that is quickly advancing through eastern Germany. He can take the Brandenburgers, but I don’t think Turkey is a fight that William can win.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Even as Turkey pushes into Afghanistan’s western suburbs, the Afghan army still pushes east, striking at Olive Yang’s central Asian cities. Olive has been having a rough go of it during total war, but will Afghanistan be the one to finally put Kokang in the graveyard of empires?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Arapaho have landed in South America, gaining a foothold in the former Muiscan cities of Bacata and Duitama. Still, they have failed to take Fusagasuga yet. </p><p></p><p>Things haven’t been the same for the Kayapó ever since the Great Incan War, but Raoni and his people are still determined to defend their homeland to the last. In Kremoro, Raoni gives a speech to a massive crowd of millions of citizens.</p><p></p><p>“We will kill these invaders on the coasts, and if they drive us out of the coasts, we will continue to kill them in the cities, and if we are driven out of our cities, we will go back to the jungles, where our fathers lived, and we will kill them there too!”</p><p></p><p>The crowd erupts into applause, but many still have their doubts. Invasion of Kayapo territory had been the norm for generations, but could they finally end it? Can they force back the Malians, Inca, and Arapaho? Only time will tell if they indeed will or if Raoni is going to eat his words.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Inca is now on the defensive as Timor pushes into Melanesia, capturing Maynggu Ganai and Inti Watana. Incan units are very sparse while Timor has a large array of combat units in the area. If Tupac doesn’t reinforce the area and the Timorese take it, the Incan pacific core is basically open to them. The Timorese looked like they were going to let Australia fall at the beginning of total war. How the tables have turned.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>The thunder of war rolls through the steppe as Turkey several Tuvan cities in quick succession. This slide really shows how outclassed Tuva is. They’re still sporting field artillery, mobile SAMs and rail gun armor against Turkey’s biotroopers, not to mention their smaller population. They do however seem to have a good amount of units in reserve, but Kuular needs to send them to the front ASAP. Still, I think it’s only a matter of time before Tuva gets rumped. An empire that topped the power rankings for so long consigned to such a fate is a sad thing to see.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have a look at what remains of Bengal after their disastrous war with Afghanistan. What happened Shujah Ud-din? Shujah himself is wondering what went wrong himself, sitting in his palace, listening to the distant sounds of battle as the Afghans close in on Kolkata. As this happens, Bengali chimeras attack the Kokangese city of Chin Shwe Haw, as Timorese units lay siege to nearby Siem Reap. The sick man and the sick lady of Asia, locked in a dance of death. I really can’t tell who’s more screwed here.</p>"

  scene_title: "Push for Recife"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Across the cylinder in South America, a horde of Kayapo biotroopers and hover tanks rush for Recife with the goal of driving the Malian invaders right into the sea. Any Malian units outside of the city have been annihilated by the large host of Kayapo, and the city itself has little in the way of defense aside from a single aircraft carrier. Seeing the fury of the Kayapo, many Malian troops decide to run. The city will likely fall next turn.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the Kayapo nation comes defeat, not triumph, as a large number of Incan biotroopers and GDRs make their way towards the lightly defended cities of Rio de Janiero and Kremoro, the capital. The city, seemingly badly  damaged already judging by the population loss, is in the red and will easily fall. Maybe the Kayapo will be taken earlier than I expected.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In Mexico, all but two Mohave cities are under the control of Tupac Yupanqui. The populations of these cities are one, five and one respectively, showing how hotly contested this area is. A large number of Arapaho units move down from Texas to reinforce the several Nexi looming over Aha Kwintamasave. The Arapaho have also gained a small foothold in the Yucatán by capturing Managua, but it as well as Guatemala City could flip back to the Mohave and their large amount of biotroopers.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sundiata caps four cities in one turn, two from Angola and two from Turkey, leaving the former with only two cities. He may be down in North Africa, but Sundiata is certainly not out. I wouldn’t be surprised if he completely killed Angola. Timor and Turkey are a much larger threat, but I’m confident that Mali will at least give them one hell of a fight.</p>"

  scene_title: "Goodbye Guiscard"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode39-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not only is Mail pushing in Africa, but they are pushing in Europe too! Sundiata has also decided to finally put Guiscard out of his misery, capturing the bombed-out ruins of Amsterdam. And with that, the Normans go out not with a bang, but a whimper. </p><p></p><p>I honestly didn’t really pay much attention to the Normans during most of the game. I once heard someone refer to the Normans as the burnt-out gifted kid, and I think that is a pretty good way to sum them up. They settled well in the early stages of the game, and even managed to keep those settles. It seemed like they were going to do great things in Europe and the Mediterranean, which is quite uncommon for Italian civs, but after that they did very little. They had a few minor conquests and settled North Africa, and of course caused the Castilians to be sent to the very front door of the sub, but they always were outshined by other civs. And then, after slowly building up a respectable Mediterranean empire, it was snatched away from them by the Angolans and Yugo. They were rumped and then finally crushed by the sleeping dragon of Mali, even having their old enemy, Castile, outlive them. The Normans were okay, don’t get me wrong, but they could have been so much more than okay.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The arctic wind blows Pretty Nose’s hair as she stares across the Bering Strait from A Cree City. On the other side, battle rages as Arapaho forces try to capture a Gokturk city to gain a foothold in Asia. Kashgar has fallen into the red while a nexus exchanges blows with a destroyer outside of Ongi. If the Arapaho can indeed gain a foothold in Asia and exploit the weaknesses of the civs there, that might just give them the game.</p>"

The mayor of this small island settlement rushes out of his home and is greeted by huge monsters and armored men ransacking the city.

The Malian army has been soundly beaten and the Kayapo are even going on the offensive! Kansan has been brought down to the yellow and an embarked biotrooper prepares to make landfall. Even so, the Kayapo still can’t catch a break. In the north, the Arapaho attack Kokremoro from the sea, and the Inca slowly surround Rio de Janiero. The celebration in Recife will soon be cut short, for the happy citizens and soldiers of the city will be redeployed to continue the increasingly hopeless fight. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Timorese are sparing Savimbi, at least for the moment, as they focus their attention on Arwa’s Yemen. A horde of biotroopers and biotitans make their way towards Kilwa Kisiwani. The Yemeni army is tired and very depleted, and both Kilwa Kisiwani and Kuito to the north are not likely to hold. Rumors have circulated that Timorese ships have even been probing the coast of Madagascar, and that the capital of Isandlwana could fall in the coming weeks. Yemeni high command has tried to quash these rumors to save morale, but they too are worried. The Yemeni people have fought so hard for their nation, but is it all going to be for nothing?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Turkish Army marches into Pul-I-Alam and is now a single tile away from the Afghan capital, and the Afghan army, for its part, seems to be offering no resistance at all. Durranni seems to be so occupied with expanding his empire that he has neglected to keep enough units around to defend the homeland. The Wiradjuri did the same thing during their war with Timor, and that ended very poorly for them, as we know. If Durranni doesn’t change things up soon, he may suffer the same fate.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tuva seems to be having the same issue as well, as they push hard against Han in the east while Turkey rolls through their borders relatively unchallenged in the west. Still, they are doing quite well in this endeavor, as they have just captured the very cool sounding city of Ötüken, and Chengdu seems ready to fall as well. If they continue to push hard, they could soon be in reach of Chang’an. Turkic mythology, Ötüken is the name of the sacred homeland of the Turks, and is also used as another name for Mother Earth. It’s also fun to say. Ötüken.</p>"

The outer lands of her empire have been gnawed away by the Han, Timor, and Afghanistan. Her army has been ground down to nothing and two more cities in the southeast seem ready to fall to Timor. I like Kokang, but I’m just being honest. I was actually hoping for them to outlast Han, but that’s now very unlikely to happen. Stay strong Yang. </p>"

  narration: "<p>THEY DID IT! The Anglo-Dutch have taken Berlin! I didn’t think William had it in him, but he proved me wrong. Brandenburg has been completely chopped in half in mainland Europe, with their Nordic core and the Isles being the only relatively safe places left. Not only that, but the Malian presence around Utrecht has completely disappeared. Timor Leste is of course the poster boy for a come up against all odds, but remember that the Anglo-Dutch were ranked 59 or 60 in episode 0. They are super tough, and their performance in total war and fucking over of the Brandenburgers has almost made me forgive them for killing Ireland. Almost.</p>"

His admirals are gathered around him, and he is giving them a serious tongue lashing.</p><p></p><p>“Where were you? We have enough ships to cover half the North Sea, and you just sit around in them? That little pansy boy William has captured Berlin and you were just sitting here?”</p><p></p><p>The admirals look at the ground sheepishly.

Despite their American territories being in literal pieces, the Mohave are still able to pump out a large amount of advanced units. The Inca have very little to defend their Mexican cities with, so they will have to flip these cities back at some point. </p><p></p><p>Also, look at Cuscowilla. 97 population!

Xanana seems to be having the same problem that the Bengalis had in this area, as there are few units to be seen, and definitely not enough to defend the five island cities in his possession. Total war has taken a big toll on the armies of most civs, and few seem to be replacing those units. They’ll have to do it sooner or later, though, and sooner would be much better than later.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Just as the two get into Eugowra, Timorese troops raise the red and gold flag over the city once again.</p><p></p><p>“Damn!” Windradyne says. “They already took it back over.”</p><p></p><p>“Are we still going to kill them?” Lowanna asks. </p><p></p><p>“Nononono, let’s not. Look at them all. What kind of guns are those, even?”</p><p></p><p>“So… we went all this way and got all these explosives for nothing?”</p><p></p><p>“I guess so, Lowanna. I wonder if I have to go the sub.”</p><p></p><p>“What do you mean by that?” Lowanna asks.</p><p></p><p>“Well…” Windradyne starts. “When a leader dies. They don’t die for real. They can’t even die. Olga, Allende, Wonggu, they all get taken to somewhere real cold and far away. I… I don’t know if I should tell you more, Lowanna.” </p><p></p><p>“Are only you allowed to go?” Lowanna asks.</p><p></p><p>“I don’t know, why?”</p><p></p><p>“Well, because, uhh… Windradyne. I want you to be my boyfriend.” She says.</p><p></p><p>And now, we have come to the end. We’ve seen incredible, unexpected comebacks, the rumpification and ascension of civs, and the death and rebirth of many nations, beloved or otherwise. I am truly grateful I could narrate this episode for you. This has been goatbaby. Goodbye.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
