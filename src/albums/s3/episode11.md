    narration: "<p>Hello and welcome to Episode 11 of the CBRX Season 3! I’m NopeCopter, also known as u/daXfactorz, and I’ll be your narrator this time around. I apologize for any issues with the narration this time, it was a bit of a rush job and I had to scrap a lot of narration due to time issues, but hopefully it’s as enjoyable as ever. We’ve got a lot to cover this time, so strap in!</p>"

Despite being under attack from all sides at sea, North Korea’s defense of their home peninsula holds strong as the Ming naval assault on Chongjin collapses. The Ainu assault on Tajihi-Sarugake isn’t faring much better, and Mori hasn’t even bothered to send any ships to help the war effort. North Korea is safe for now.</p>"

The city is in fine enough shape for now, but with an Indonesian fleet that large, the Philippines could soon be reduced to just their capital. And Indonesia is already thinking ahead, too - they’ve already declared war on Cambodia so that they can immediately get to conquering once they secure Cavite el Viejo.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Permians are seeing a bit more success on the eastern front, having retaken Izyur from Tuva, but it doesn’t take a genius to see that the Tuvans still have quite the advantage. Tuva has units for days (though they’re mostly ranged units), while the Permians seem to be running a bit low and have much less presence on the front lines. Tuva’s signature “singing arrows”, in particular, have struck fear into the Permian forces and caused their morale to drop significantly - with a deafening “ÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜÜ”, the sound of thousands of arrows signals the coming of death itself.</p>"

The Greenlandic navy is being held up at sea by two Vermont Triremes, and Holsteinsborg completely lacks a military to threaten Vermont’s capital with. Leading the defense of Windsor is Juan Peron, the former president of Argentina, founder of Peronism as an ideology, and husband of Mk. 2’s Eva Peron.

Still, their military is unimpressive, and while they are still trying to settle, they’re losing too much money to really close the gap between them and, say, Chile. Also worth noting are the Brazilian fleet around Rio de Janeiro and the sizable Kayapo force around Mekragnoti.</p>"

Their UU, the Samogitian Warrior, is a Swordsman which gains a massive Strength bonus and free Health per turn while on a Forest tile - perfect for fighting on their eastern and southern borders. Lithuania is certainly a force to be reckoned with, though luckily for everyone around them, they currently seem preoccupied with invading the Massagetae outpost to their northeast.</p>"

Highlights include the Kayapo ALSO founding a Theocratic State and Castile already being in the hands of the Bourgeoisie. </p><details><summary>LORE</summary><ul><li>Bengal remains a tribal entity, prosperous but hardly united - the people of Bengali Sumatra, for instance, only nominally recognize Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan as their overlord.</li><li>Botswana is still a Peasant’s Republic, as per Seretse Khama’s wishes.</li><li>Brandenburg is also still a Tribe - more specifically, it’s a collection of towns and cities which each function as their own micro-state, with Frederick William I merely hosting an occasional council between the heads of each town to discuss matters of Brandenburg as a whole.</li><li>Brazil is a Monarchy under Pedro I and his Nobles. Pedro’s kingdom is small, but the people are evidently happy.</li><li>Cambodia is nominally a Republic, though only a select class of oligarchs can actually vote. Sihanouk himself is not often involved in governmental affairs anymore - instead, he’s taken to equestrianism.</li><li>Castile is a Monarchy ruled by the Bourgeoisie, and as such the peasants and the rural population are completely ignored in favor of the whims of the city folk. In fact, it is often said that, to Isabella, everything outside the walls of Madrid might as well be an empty void.</li><li>The Kayapo have abandoned their former Republic and instead come under the rule of a Theocratic State, with the priesthood and prophets established by Raoni taking full control of the state’s affairs.</li><li> Central America is now a Republic dominated by the Populists, who continue to look inward and appease the citizenry rather than bothering to expand outward into the rapidly-dwindling available land in Mesoamerica.</li><li>Chad is a Tribe, or rather a confederation of Tribes - everybody gets a say in the affairs of the tribe, which has become quite cumbersome as the Chadian people have expanded all across northern Africa.</li></ul></details>"

Highlights this time include the Han Principality being under the control of Business Magnates and not one but two Peasant’s Republics (Greenland and the Inca).</p><details><summary>LORE</summary><ul><li>The Cree are still under the control of the Monarchy - King Poundmaker is untested but eager to prove that his reign is just.</li><li>Timor-Leste is a Republic ruled by the Populists, who have promised to repair the economy and treat the people right.</li><li>Egypt is still a Tribe, now ruled primarily by the Commons - notably, Akhenaten has been all but ousted from power for his failures, and the House of Commons now operates the government from Thebes while Akhetaten has been reduced to more of a symbolic capital.</li><li>Greenland is a Peasant’s Republic ruled communally by all who live within its borders, which is a big reason why they’ve been so eager to expand throughout the sea - more coastline means more room to fish and a more prosperous life for the primarily sea-based Greenlandic peasantry.</li><li>Han is a Principality now, with the massive majority of the power located in the hands of the wealthy merchant class and business Magnates who have established a stranglehold on the economy.</li><li>Qocho is a Tribe ruled by a small noble family, still stubbornly clinging onto power due to their claims of divine righteousness. So long as the Qocho continue to miraculously fend off much larger empires, the Qocho nobles hardly need to worry about the faith of their people waning.</li><li>The Inca are a Peasant Republic under the nominal rule of Prince Tupac Yupanqui, who has taken on a primarily ceremonial and spiritual role as well as becoming a patron of the arts.</li><li>Indonesia remains a Tribe, though the various Indonesian families and towns are fairly close-knit despite the ocean separating them from one another.</li><li>Kokang is also still a tribal entity, but a council of elders keeps the various tribes of Kokang tied fairly closely together.</li><li>The Permians are ruled by a Monarchy, though clearly King Azykay is struggling to enact his will over the more far-flung corners of his kingdom.</li></ul></details>"

Now several Populist leaders have been elected into power, and Willie Seaweed has only minor power over his civilization.</li><li>The Kyivan Rus’ are still a Tribe, yet populism still rules the day as Chieftess Olga has apparently fled into the woods at the sight of the Lithuanian armies to consult with Allah.</li><li>Lithuania is still a military dictatorship under the iron fist of Gediminas and his elite soldiers.</li><li>Mali is a Republic, albeit one ruled by the oligarchic upper class. The general populace is less than happy about this, especially considering how slowly anything gets done with the oligarchs in charge.</li><li>The Maori remain a tribal confederation even now, with each family mostly doing their own thing.</li><li>The Massagetae are also a tribal confederation - while Tomyris is their mighty battlemaster, decisions are made by every member of the confederation, even the lowest members of society.</li><li>The Ming Peasant’s Republic has collapsed, with a Monarchy under King Yongle rising in its place. The people view his rule with suspicion, but they’re willing to accept it for now after the disastrous war against North Korea and the subsequent infighting.</li><li>The Modoc remain a tribe, but the Magnates hold all the power - they finance the military, so the rest of the tribe gives them effectively free rein in return.</li><li>The Mohave have shifted from a Peasant’s Republic to a Principality. The citizens still hold the power, but now it’s mostly the higher-class citizens who get a say, rather than the peasantry.</li><li>Mori remains under the control of the Monarchy, though a House of Commons has been put in place to check the power of King Mori Motonari.
