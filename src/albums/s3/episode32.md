      narration: "<p>I’d like to take a moment to highlight the always-excellent work of the CBR’s resident cartographer, Vihreaa! Highlights of this week’s map are Australia in Timorese red, the Kayapó consolidation of South America, and the Arapaho looking more and more like the dominant power of North America as they push the U.S to the sea. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Topping the Power Rankings again this week is Timor-Leste! After conquering Australia, Timor has become the biggest civ in the game and a statistical monster, with the most production and science by a significant margin.

      narration: "<p>We begin our episode in the turquoise waters of the Caribbean, where an American fleet warily stands guard over Tiwanaku. They had been spared from the brutal war of attrition against the Arapaho being waged to the North, but that fragile peace is about to be shattered. Ship captains sound the alarm as Kayapó warplanes roar overhead, armed to the teeth with bombs destined for Tiwanaku. American forces are already stretched to the limit against the Arapaho, so this invasion is something Roosevelt really can’t afford to deal with. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Meanwhile in the steppes of Northern Turkey, tensions had been high ever since Lithuania’s conquest of the last Massagetae enclave deep within Turkish territory. The world watches with bated breath as Atatürk speaks from a balcony in Adana, flanked by hundreds of cutting-edge artillery units. “This flagrant violation of Turkish and Massagetae sovereignty shall not stand! Turkey hereby declares war on the Lithuanian regime.” He proclaims, to thunderous applause.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Immediately Asir’s defenses are reduced to nothing, as Turkish battleships, warplanes, and tanks swarm the city. Already this war looks like a disaster for Lithuania. The question isn’t whether they can win, but whether Gediminas can muster enough defenses to survive. </p><p>The tech gap between the two combatants is also evident looking at the Turkish interior, which is sporting futuristic improvements such as hydroponic domes and communications arrays. These will allow Turkish cities to have ample food, gold and production even in barren desert, ensuring that their explosive growth won’t come to a halt any time soon. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Things look bad for the Americans as well, as Tiwanaku has already fallen, with no clear opportunity for recapture. Fortunately for Roosevelt, Muisca territory is blocking the Kayapó from advancing further, though a sneaky nuclear sub has gotten through somehow. If the Kayapó do have open borders with the Muisca, they could put more pressure on America’s Cuban holdings along with the Arapaho.</p>"

      narration: "<p>But that is not to be, for Pretty Nose has another strategy in mind. On July 4th, 2054 AD, the mood is grim in the war room of Washington D.C., as Führer-President Roosevelt reads aloud a letter from an Arapaho emissary.</p><p>“Mr. President,</p><p>Allow me to congratulate you on your recent victories. Victories most military strategists had believed impossible. However, in your haste you seem to have forgotten something important - that our words are backed with nuclear weapons. You have 3 days from receipt of this letter to surrender all contested cities to our control, or there will be nothing left to contest.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Chieftess Pretty Nose of the Arapaho”</p><p>With that, the war is over, and America has surrendered.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode32-scene11.jpg
      narration: "<p>A more Northern view reveals that America’s empire is well and truly shattered by the amount of cities given to the Arapaho. With all these cities disconnected, even Greenland could possibly take a chunk out of the remains. Pretty Nose lost many battles, but won the war in the end. The fact that the Arapaho currently have a whopping 102 (!) nuclear weapons surely had something to do with Roosevelt’s decision. I wonder, are America’s neighbors cheering the defeat of fascism, or fearful that they may be the next target of the now battle-hardened Arapaho army?</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode32-scene12.jpg
      narration: "<p>One war ends, but another rages on. Such is life on the Cylinder. The Mohave navy has managed to seize Shuntian, making landfall on Asia. Crossing the oceans is one of the greatest tests for any contender, but it looks like the Mohave are running out of steam despite their huge tech advantage.If they can peace out and maintain a beachhead in Asia, that would be a significant win. </p>"

      scene_title: "Bombs Falling Like Rain"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode32-scene13.jpg
      narration: "<p>Returning to the Turkish-Lithuanian front confirms that this will be brutal for Lithuania. Turkey has an overwhelming technological and numerical advantage. I count 69 Turkish planes in this slide alone, along with modern armor, rocket artillery, and other late game powerhouse units. Asir has fallen, and multiple Lithuanian core cities have already been bombarded to black. Gediminas had better start working on a peace deal, but looking at the terms America got, that might not be enough to save his chances. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch, meanwhile, care nothing for the wars raging around the world, preferring to vibe to the latest hits from celebrated DJ Grandmaster Flash. Now that he’s conquered England and fulfilled the ‘Anglo’ in ‘Anglo-Dutch’, William III seems perfectly content to sit, rebuild, and bide his time.</p><p>In our world, Grandmaster Flash is an American DJ born to Barbadian immigrants. He is known for forming Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, the first Rap group to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as inventing a DJ technique called Quick Mix Theory and the slipmat, which allowed DJs to freely manipulate records on a turntable.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Defying my predictions, Mohave forces somehow capture Long Htan on Taiwan. But the tide of battle now seems to be decisively turning, as a huge force of Kokang Kakweyes and battleships, with one valiant galleass bringing up the rear, moves to the front. Maybe the galleass is a museum piece brought out to boost morale? </p>"

      scene_title: "The Vilnius Blitz"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode32-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>Turkey continues its advance, with the difference in airpower having a devastating effect. Vilnius itself is in the red, and a modern armor from the front could reach it in two turns of movement.I don’t know why Gediminas was so set on eliminating the Massagetae, but he is surely regretting it now. Even in the cutthroat world of the CBR, the warmonger penalties from elimination are high. </p>"

      scene_title: "Mohave Maritime Museum"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode32-scene17.jpg
      narration: "<p>Sure enough, Long Htan flips back, and seems likely to end up securely in Kokang hands. Shuntian has flipped back and forth, but the Mohave are vastly outnumbered. Looking at the number of carriers around Niitakayama, the Mohave might be able to maintain some ground in this war if they bring in more airpower, since the Kokang have very few air defenses. The Mohave also have a few museum pieces of their own sailing the high seas, with privateers, galleons, and a frigate visible to the Northeast. They certainly have the technology and gold to upgrade them, so I’m sticking with my theory that the vintage ships are good for morale. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Turns out the Anglo-Dutch have a passion other than music, and that passion is nuclear annihilation. William III gives a speech to celebrate the occasion, flanked by the finest physicists, generals, and DJs of the Anglo-Dutch. </p><p>“With this new weapon, we shall defend our homeland against any and all who threaten it!” he crows. </p><p>A reporter raises their hand and asks “but what about Amsterdam?” only to be promptly drowned out as William turns up the volume on Grandmaster Flash’s latest hit.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Turkish advance is only accelerating, as Birzai, T’Ver, and Siauliai all fall in a single turn, with the capture of Trakai and even Vilnius looking imminent. Remember when we mocked Turkey for struggling against Kyivan Rus’? Those days are long gone after the rapid dismemberment of the Permians, and now Turkey seems set to continue its streak of efficient, ruthless victories. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Inca have been at peace for a long time, but seem to have built up a healthy navy and modern army. Their cities are also looking prosperous, perhaps thanks in part to the modern architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.</p><p></p><p>In our world, Frank Lloyd Wright is an American architect known for designing structures to harmonize with humanity and the environment. He was known to have been inspired by traditional Japanese and Mayan architecture, and given the extent of the Incan empire in the CBR, perhaps these influences remain. </p>"

      narration: "<p>This… looks like the end of the line for Lithuania. Turkey advances in a red and yellow tide, capturing five cities in one turn, including Vilnius, Lithuania’s original capital. Gardnas is in the black and Turkey’s forces still look fresh. Lithuania’s navy in the Baltic and Arctic might be able to manage a few flips, but that won’t last long. With all of this unfolding in just 5 turns, Ataturk has once again proven himself a master of blitzkrieg. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The shoe is on the other foot in the Mohave-Kokang war, as Olive Yang’s troops besiege Guilin. With the city’s low defense and a tank in capture range, it could fall if Yang is smart about her tactics. This war was a bold play by the Mohave, but it’s starting to look like it was the wrong play unless they can reliably bring reinforcements from their core. At this rate the Kokang could recapture Kaifeng, and even Yoshida-Koriyama, with its lack of defenses, could be at risk. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode32-scene24.jpg
      narration: "<p>Somehow, Gediminas has eked out a peace deal with Turkey that allowed him to keep his capital, but the cost was steep. Lyda, Kaunas, Rostov, and Gardnas, on top of the cities Turkey claimed by force, are all surrendered as part of the agreement. Vilnius is now an exclave, and Lithuania looks like a shell of its former self. But for Turkey, this is another overwhelming victory, and Ataturk is showing that he is in it to win it. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Roosevelt and Raoni agree to peace, with the Kayapó keeping control of Tiwanaku after a brief showcase of their naval competence. After the devastating peace deal with the Arapaho, Roosevelt is surely grateful to end this war with only one small exclave lost. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Tetouan makes peace with the Zulu, ending what was clearly the greatest threat to the Zulu’s survival. Perhaps that’s less of a stretch than it seems, since the Kilwa have forgotten that ships can’t capture landlocked cities, and neither Angola nor Timor seems inclined to absorb the warmonger penalty of eliminating a civ. Timor has certainly bulked up their naval presence in the area though, could they be plotting something?</p>"

      narration: "<p>If anyone thought that Pretty Nose wasn’t done yet after claiming victory over the Americans, you were right, as the Arapaho declare war on the Cree! The humble title of Mayoress belies Pretty Nose’s ambition to become the one true hegemon of North America, and she won’t let anything stop her now. Though the Cree are a power in their own right, the Arapaho start this war with a decisive advantage, having dozens of planes within striking distance of the Cree capital. This war could determine who wins North America - the Cree, Arapaho, or the wild card Mohave.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Meanwhile in South America, the Kayapó consolidate their recent gains. The field of contenders in South America seems to have come down to the Inca or the Kayapó, with the Kayapó having most of the continent, but the Inca having a massive Pacific empire and defensible mainland cities. The Muisca are a longshot, but in the event of war between the two top dogs, whether they pick a side could be decisive.</p>"

      narration: "<p>A look at Gokturk lands shows some truly terrible bordergore, with Tuvan and Han citadels making Nevkat into a one-tile exclave and taking chunks of land away from Gokturk core cities. Is this merely bullying and posturing, or the buildup to another war in Siberia?</p>"

      narration: "<p>As predicted, the Arapaho are starting off their war with the Cree strong, seizing Sipiwininiwak (my condolences to the audio narrators) within a single turn. The Cree will likely retake it this same turn, but being unable to defend their capital is a dire portent for their chances.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch seem to be exporting the trend of pairing music with nuclear weapons programs to the other middle powers of the Cylinder, as the Muisca complete their own Manhattan Project to the sound of songs from Dutch-French singer Ramses Shaffy.</p><p>Normally I’d highlight some IRL facts about the great person on screen, but this time I wanted to quickly note the contrast in technological development here. The Muisca are still sporting triremes, of all things, as part of their fleet, while the Mohave have advanced destroyers and battlesuits. The question is, why aren’t all those advanced ships fighting the Kokang instead of sailing in circles by Guatemala City?</p>"

      narration: "<p>Top underdog Timor-Leste continues to thrive, sporting a large, diverse navy and army, including what I believe is the first airborne forces unit (Future Worlds paratrooper upgrade) that we’ve seen so far. Based on last episode’s stats sheet, taking some time to consolidate their Australian gains has paid off for Timor, with the 3rd largest military, and highest production and effective science. With top-tier stats and vulnerable neighbors, the sky's the limit for Timor-Leste right now.</p>"

In an attempt to keep the spirits of his people high, Windradyne has recruited English photography pioneer and polymath Henry Fox Talbot, and encouraged photography of New Zealand’s beautiful wilderness. </p><p>Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877) is known for his development of salted paper and calotype processes, which were precursors to future advancements in photography. But he was also a polymath who was elected to the Royal Society in 1831 for his work on integral calculus, optics, chemistry, electricity and other subjects such as etymology, the decipherment of cuneiform, and ancient history.

      narration: "<p>Sayyida Al-Hurra sits upon her makeshift throne in Marrakech, sharpening her saber and chuckling as she reads the war declaration in angry red ink from Gediminas of Lithuania. After all, what is an empire hundreds of miles away supposed to do, especially after being humiliated by Turkey? Suddenly, a shadow darkens the palace, and an enormous warship drops from the sky, landing with a tremendous splash in the Mediterranean. The ship flies Lithuanian colors, and as the guns begin to fire, Sayyida Al-Hurra, Queen of Tetouan, laughs and weeps until it hurts. Of all the misfortunes visited on her people, this one had to be the most absurd yet. </p><p>Lithuania’s warships in the Baltic were teleported here after being forced out by the new Turkish borders, but will they be able to achieve anything in this foreign land? Perhaps all of this was just part of Gediminas’ master plan to secure an exclave far beyond Turkey’s reach.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Cambodia! Anonymity is apparently the best defense for this little city-state, which has been rewarded with a long peace after somehow fending off Kokang for centuries. Chad can’t really do anything here, but it would be a different story if they could persuade other countries to join in.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Tuva holds on to Kuva, and seizes Anyksciai as well, making incremental progress against Lithuania. However, Seinai is in an extremely defensible position, so unless Tuva brings overwhelming force to bear and finds a way to sink those submarines, any units they embark to get to Seinai will become shark food in short order. </p>"

      narration: "<p>I take back what I said. Even if Chad persuades other countries to join its bizarre coalition, Cambodia will probably be just fine. Yugoslavia decides that if Chad is declaring war on Cambodia, that must be what all the cool kids are doing, and decides to join in, throwing in a declaration of war against Kilwa for good measure. Come on Tito, Berlin is right there and barely defended!</p><p>With that, we conclude another thrilling episode of the Civ Battle Royale, and what a memorable one it has been! </p><p>Narrating an episode has definitely made me appreciate all the narrators who came before even more than I already did. There are so many talented writers following the CBR it’s hard to wrap my mind around it. Certainly felt like I had a lot to live up to. So if you’ve narrated before, an extra-special thanks to you! </p><p>This has been captainbork15, and it’s been a joy and privilege to narrate for you all today!</p>"
