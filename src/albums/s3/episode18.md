    narration: "<p>Hello, CBR fans! The name’s TopHatPaladin, longtime fan, first-time narrator. You might remember me as the author of this season’s Zulu mod, or the co-author of Tuva, but today I’m here as your guide to Episode 18. Strap on your seat belts and let’s get to it!</p>"

    narration: "<p>ExplosiveWatermelon (EW) brings us this week’s OC. I wholeheartedly echo Chalmers’ sentiment in the image— good lord, what *is* happening in Australia?? This will be a big region to watch this week, due to the tangled web of wars that criss-cross the continent.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The top three civs slid around the power rankings this week: the rankers lost a bit of confidence in Turkey, causing it to slide down to third, and in its place Tuva has reclaimed the number-one spot. Their lead is a precarious one— Brandenburg and Turkey are both nipping closely at Tuva’s heels— but as a Totally Unbiased I Promise observer who’s got the bully pulpit this week, I’m going to take this opportunity to say:</p><p></p><p>TUVA SWEEP HERE WE GO BABY THERE’S NO STOPPIN US NOW</p>"

    narration: "<p>Now, before we get down to brass tacks, we’ve also got a look at the government overview! Since we last checked in, Raoni Metuktire’s government has moved past traditional forms of factionalism and adopted party politics. Currently, it appears that the Kayapó megacities are in the hands of the socialist Left Party.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Other than the Kayapó, the Cree are the cylinder’s only merchant league, and they’ve got some news to report as well. After securing the Kwak capital of Tigwaxsti, Poundmaker has awarded himself the title of Prince of the Kwakwaka’wakw! Willie Seaweed is sure to be annoyed about this, but he doesn’t have much recourse to fight back about it.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Scrolling through the list of military dictatorships, we can also see that Ethan Allen has taken on the title of Strategos! This title indicates that Ethan Allen has taken the Partial Equity and Might-Based Legitimacy reforms.</p><p></p><p>Partial Equity reduces Unhappiness per city, but increases Unhappiness from Population; Might-Based Legitimacy increases Sovereignty when all cities have a unit garrison. Since Vermont controls all of one city, Partial Equity won’t do much good, but it should be easy to meet the Might-Based Legitimacy condition and speed up their rate of collecting reforms.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>Just like we saw with Poundmaker before, we can see that Pretty Nose has adopted a title to reflect the enemy capital that she’s captured. Specifically, she’s declared herself the “Dictator of the Comanche,” making no secret of her intent to crush the Comanche population underfoot.</p>"

    scene_title: "Red Sky at Morning…"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>Government overview superfans will recall that Frederick William’s self-appointed anti-barbarian title was already in force in Episode 15, Scene 37, so I’ll avoid rehashing the analysis there and instead give a shout-out to the three monastic orders visible on this slide. Two of the monk-led civs are Tetouan and the Normans; apparently there’s something in the depths of the Mediterranean that drives its sailors into the church.</p>"

    scene_title: "Emperors and Peasants"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>Finally, we can see that Olive Yang has crowned herself Emperor of the Romans; this surreal choice of title was recently highlighted by EW, who posted a Kokang-Roman Empire flag on the subreddit recently.</p><p></p><p>We can also see a few Peasant’s Republics on the map: Cambodia, Egypt, and Kyivan Rus. Olga is probably the most robust-looking of these civs, which isn’t a great omen for the long-term survivability of this government type.</p>"
  - scene_number: 12
    scene_title: "Btw If I Use The Accented “é” In “Tetouan” It Means I’m Referring To The City And If I Don’t Then I’m Referring To The Civ"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>And now, into the action! We start this episode in earnest by examining the ongoing Mali–Tetouan war, where it’s clear that Tetouan’s monastic government is poorly equipped for warfare. Fez is solidly in Malian control, and Mali’s Ton-Tigi cavalry is camping at the gates of Tetouan’s eponymous capital city. Sayyida does have SOME units ready to defend the city, but they’re pretty poorly positioned, so she’ll need luck on her side if she wants to keep Tétouan.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Meanwhile in Asia, we see our two Chinese civs at each other’s throats. Emperor Wu has mostly cleared out Yongle’s ground forces, and while the Ming fleet is respectable, a fleet won’t be able to prevent the Han from besieging the inland city of Nanjing.</p>"

    scene_title: "In Which Poundmaker Repeats Seward’s Folly"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>Last episode, the Cree were flipping the Kwak city of Essipit; now, they’ve seized Mimkumlis as well, allowing them to reinforce their capture better. And, honestly, this seems like a wise pickup for the Cree in general— the fighting around Essipit could still go either way, but Mimkumlis is pretty much impossible for Willie to retake at the moment.</p>"

    scene_title: "No Mo Doc, No Mo Problems"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>In addition to their war against the Kwakwaka’wakw, the Cree were laying siege to the Modoc capital at Captain Jack’s Stronghold— but it’s the Mohave who grab a knight and snipe the city for themselves! With this capture, Kintpuash of the Modoc is eliminated in 55th place.</p><p></p><p>The Modoc were never an especially robust competitor – from the start, they were slow to expand – but they were especially neutered after unnecessarily ceding their second city, Agawesh, to the Kwaks. Writing their eulogy is Denis Fonvizin, a playwright who was highly influential on Russian literary comedy… but if he’s unlucky, the Mohave will kill him too before he can present it.</p>"

    scene_title: "Timor-Sul"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Down in Australia, Timor-Leste keeps the pressure on the Yolngu. This war was something of a flipfest last episode, since Timor had no ground forces and Yolngu had no navy, but Timor is now reaping the benefits of its stronger production base. Wonggu is rapidly running out of land units, and Xanana still has plenty of ships to throw at the front. Milingimbi might flip once more, but if Xanana is smart then he’ll definitely be able to own it by war’s end.</p>"

    scene_title: "Who Needs Opium When You’ve Got Aspirin"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>In Central Asia, we can see Ahmad Shah Durrani luxuriating in his sprawling Afghan empire. He’s happy to show off to foreign dignitaries, including caravans from Yemen, Bengal, the Gokturks, the Permians, Han, Vladimir, and the Massagetae— plus, no fewer than four Indonesian scouts.</p><p></p><p>Durrani credits his success in part to the role of Friedrich Bayer, a Great Merchant who in our world founded the pharmaceutical giant Bayer (the inventor of aspirin!).</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Not content with kicking the Ainu off of mainland Asia, Bumin Qaghan has begun laying siege to their capital city on Hokkaido. However, while Bumin is doing quite a lot of damage to Sat Poro Pet, he has no shot at taking the city unless he brings a melee unit to the front; maybe the carrack near Kengü Tarman, or the one at port in Kashgar.</p>"

    scene_title: "Also pictured: various disappointed Indonesian settlers"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Wiradjuri–Maori war rages on, with Windradyne launching an assault on Potatau’s final Australian city, Maraekowhai. The Maori have only a skeleton crew defending the city, so it’s probably just a matter of time before this outpost is waving the Wiradjuri banner.</p><p></p><p>Up north, we can see the Yolngu launching their counteroffensive against Milingimbi— they’re poised to retake the city, but will they be able to keep it?</p>"

    scene_title: "Return of the Thooth Fairy"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Pandya have retaken their island colony of Thoothukudi, which Kilwa had briefly captured last episode. This city will probably remain in Pandya’s hands for the foreseeable future: without the element of surprise, Kilwa simply has too little manpower in this part of the world. By contrast, while the Pandya empire is small, it’s fairly well carpeted.</p><p></p><p>In unrelated news, the Cree and Mohave have made peace with the remaining Modoc units, so it seems Denis Fonvizin will be free to continue writing his plays.</p>"

    scene_title: "Sea vs. SEA"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Riding high off his elimination of the Philippines, Suharto decides to press his luck by declaring war on Kokang. According to the latest stat sheet, Kokang only has two-thirds the military manpower that Indonesia does— and at first glance, the Indonesian military seems to be more navally focused than Kokang’s. However, the raw numbers obscure the fact that Indonesia’s forces are pretty widely scattered. It’ll be an uphill battle for Suharto to walk out of this war with many gains, especially if he also wants to keep Cavite el Viejo.</p>"

    scene_title: "From Norway to Normandy to Sicily to…?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Born and raised in Normandy, Robert Guiscard first traveled to Sicily as a mercenary, and was so successful that he managed to establish his own kingdom in the region. And now, he’s apparently bored of the kingdom he founded, so he’s ditched the Mediterranean and is offering his services to Botswana. At Guiscard’s direction, Botswana has built up a sizable army in its northern stretches— but interestingly, both Botswana and the Zulu seem to be hanging back from the battlefield right now. Besides a small skirmish north of Nongoma, this showdown has devolved into a cold war.</p>"

    scene_title: "Sad Poro Pet :("
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene23.jpg
    narration: "<p>Bumin Qaghan listened to my advice and procured a melee unit! A Gokturk caravel goes swooping in to capture Sat Poro Pet. The Ainu have a handful of units nearby, so they may yet retake their capital, but we can see that Bumin has also moved his carracks into more useful positions. Unless Shakushain makes a very carefully timed peace deal, I predict that the city will ultimately end up in Gokturk hands.</p><p></p><p>Also, wow, Willie Seaweed is really pumping out those Hamatsa Dancers.</p>"

    scene_title: "Milin-gimme That!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>Wonggu retakes Milingimbi! The Timorese navy still has plenty of units at its disposal, but none in the immediate vicinity of the city. The Yolngu should try to get out of this war while their losses are minimal.</p><p></p><p>The panel in the upper left reminds us that Timor-Leste is at war with both the Yolngu and the Wiradjuri— and, now that Galiwinku is securely Timorese, there’s a Timor–Wiradjuri land border. However, the only unit interested in waging war along that border is a single Wiradjuri knight, who’s marching around in Galiwinku’s exurbs.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Ming are gathering all their forces to defend Nanjing— including some high-tech Shenji Musketeers— but I think their biggest defensive asset is actually that one-tile lake west of the city. This small body of water is preventing the massive Han invasion force from assaulting the Ming capital in every direction at once.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Shakushain retakes his capital with a trireme, thus sparing both of his swordsmen on Hokkaido. He’s playing this wisely; by dragging out the flipfest as long as possible, he maximizes his odds of persuading Bumin to give up and let him keep his capital.</p>"

    scene_title: "Funza in the Sun-za"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Muisca establish Funza on the island of Bermuda! This city is wholly undefended, so if Roosevelt decides to mobilize that galleon fleet along the Eastern Seaboard, it’s pretty sure to flip. Still looks cool, though. Elsewhere in the Atlantic, we can see a handful of Gokturk scouts floating around, looking for other islands to claim.</p>"

    narration: "<p>As the Ming continue their defense of Nanjing, they procure a Treasure Fleet! This unique Great Admiral has extra sight and can purchase City-States, so— for a defensive war on a map with no city-states— it’s effectively a regular Great Admiral for them.</p><p></p><p>Nanjing’s health is continuing to chip away (it’s gone from high yellow to low yellow since last turn), but the Ming ground forces are growing, so they may still have a chance to turn this campaign around.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Tétouan has dropped to half of its health! And Mali has some carracks nearby to deal the finishing blow, if it comes to that. Thus far, it looks like Sundiata is being pretty scrupulous about mopping up Tetouani melee units, as well; has he finally learned from his past series of humiliations against Sayyida?</p>"

    scene_title: "Zheng He’s Ambition"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>I won’t blame anyone for forgetting that the Ming and Inca were at war— I’d certainly forgotten, myself— but Tupac Yupanqui remembers! He’s discovered that the Ming colonized Hawaii, and he’s not happy. Guiyang will be hard for the Inca to attack, since it only borders one water tile, but the Inca may have enough galleons to brute-force the city regardless.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode18-scene31.jpg
    narration: "<p>Maraekowhai burns! While the Maori do have one melee unit nearby (the Toa there is a Longswordsman replacement), its health is probably too low for it to retake the city. Thus, I can say confidently: the Maori have been driven entirely off of Australia. However, Windradyne cannot claim to be overlord of the continent until he deals with the Timorese, who— as we can see at the top edge of the image— have taken Milingimbi again.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We now zoom out to look at the South American continent more broadly. The Kayapó and Inca have a lengthy, but peaceful, border. To the north, we also see the Muisca, who seem quite happy with their captured port city of Baú. However, the Kayapó don’t seem interested in retaking the city at the moment; instead, they’re content to listen to the Romantic pianist Louis Moreau Gottschalk.</p>"

    narration: "<p>With Essipit and Mimkumlis firmly secured, the Cree are proceeding further westward, trying to find the best way to attack Xwalkw. The Kwakwaka’wakw defenses are pretty thin on the ground here; it seems like Willie is just relying on Alaska’s naturally defensive geography.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The sheer numbers of the Han army have overwhelmed the Ming’s Shenji Musketeers! Nanjing has fallen!</p><p></p><p>Yongle has a handful of land units still around, but with his closest melee units taking substantial damage, I don’t think he has great odds of retaking his capital.

    narration: "<p>Resentful that their handiwork is always being shipped to the Polynesian colonies, a group of disgruntled Inca artisans have taken up arms in the mountains south of Ollantaytambo. Normally, longswords are only issued to elite Inca soldiers, who undergo special training to enter the ranks of the Chaska Chuqui; however, these rebels are a motley group who have no particular expertise with the weapon. They may cause a mess, but they won’t be an existential threat to the regime.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The land war between Botswana and the Zulu is still pretty quiet – there are skirmishes around Nongoma and Maun, but they’re mostly inconclusive. However, the Zulu navy could be making a significant play— a flotilla of carracks is converging on Serowe, and while Botswana has a handful of galleasses around, they don’t have the kind of reinforcements that the Zulu do.

The Brandenburgers have also built up an impressive fleet, with wall-to-wall carracks throughout the Skagerrak.

    narration: "<p>There’s a fun time paradox on this slide: the message at the top of the screen announces that a citadel has been built near Chongjin, but if we look to the northeast of Chongjin, we can see that the Great General hasn’t been removed from the map yet. It looks like the Ming have grabbed a couple of tiles on the Korean peninsula, thanks to Kaifeng, and the North Koreans are seizing that land for themselves. An understandable choice, though personally I’d rather see North Korea resolve this one with outright warfare.</p><p></p><p>(In the corner of the slide, we can also see that Sat Poro Pet is back in Gokturk hands.)</p>"

However, citadels aren’t the only thing that Agawesh has to worry about: Pretty Nose has just declared war on the Kwakwaka’wakw.

    narration: "<p>Thus far, the Kokang–Indonesia war seems to be waged purely on the high seas. Some ships are engaged between Muse and Cavite el Viejo, while others are operating northeast of Malolos. In Scene 35, we saw that Indonesia wasn’t in a Golden Age as of last turn, which means they can’t currently use their paradropping-boats ability; consequently, Suharto is forced to use frontal attacks like everybody else.</p><p></p><p>Also, notice on the sidebar that the Gokturks and Ainu have made peace! The Gokturks still hold the Ainu capital of Sat Poro Pet, which means Shakushain has been reduced to one city.</p>"
