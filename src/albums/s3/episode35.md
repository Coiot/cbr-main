      narration: "<p>Ohayou gozaimasu (I can say that because I’ve started writing this in the morning) to all you guys, gals, and nonbinary pals! I’m back once again to narrate this episode of CBRX3. I’m Orange aka u/Orangechrisy aka the person who did Episode 5 aka the person who makes the civball comics aka Mohave supporter extraordinaire. Alas, I did not sneak my way into the dev team yet as I suggested last time but don’t worry I still have plans… </p><p></p><p>Anyways, prepare yourselves to be subject to my relentless messy train of thoughts and shit humor, because oh boy this will be a doozy (I say before I’ve read any of the episode and I don’t read ahead as I write it). Vaguely related, yeah, I should probably really try and find a therapist again. Also, join the discord (it’s linked on the site in the upper right)!</p>"

She was a lesbian and also had some genderqueer stuff going on. There was a recent book released about her which is pretty cool, I still need to read it. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We start off this episode with a nice shot of the Angolan invasion of the Normans going just swimmingly (for the Angolans). Savimbi takes Taranto and Catania and has units outside of Benevento. Gonna be honest the Normans have a good chance of dying this episode. But they did retake Melfi from Yugoslavia so that’s something. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Arapaho continue their march into the Cree taking Mikisew and retaking Tigwaxsti. Uashat in the east somehow has not taken damage yet. And the Cree’s navy is rapidly thinning. Would be really awful for them if a certain naval power invaded them right now. *cough cough* C’mon Mohave fucking attack already what the fuck are you doing. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Nukes are continuing to fall down between these two eternal rivals, wiping out a fair few troops. But is it enough to stop the fighting altogether? No! Cree retakes Tigwaxti and pushes on Wabasca, Uashat falls to level and will soon fall. Mohave still hasn't joined the war.</p><p></p><p>Did you know that Fall Out Boy has a space between the Fall and the Out? I sure didn’t, found out when I went to check if it was Falloutboy or Fallout Boy. Was it always like this? They seem to be named a character that appeared in the Simpsons one episode, but that character looks to be spelled Fallout Boy? Why? Who did this? Why isn’t the band’s name spelled Fallout Boy? I need answers…</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Normans tap out of their conflict with Yugoslavia just after Yugoslavia retakes the Norman capital, sadly they didn’t also get Melfi but hey we take what we can get. Now Guiscard can focus all his troops against Angola, Benevento is already looking a bit safer but Palermo is down in the red soon to be taken, but Guiscard does have some tanks of his own to retake it if that happens. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Palermo falls but as I said, the Normans have a lot of troops still around it so they can take it back. Benevento still isn’t being attacked for some reason, I really don’t know why like they have multiple rocket artillery around the city and the big robot thing that I don’t know the name of and will ask Coiot for later if I need it. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene14.jpg
      narration: "<p>With this, Indonesia is out in 28th. A solid showing, made it to the top half, was a strong competitor for a bit even reaching 11th in the rankings at two points. But it was not meant to be… Timor-Leste got the upper hand and absolutely devastated Suharto, told him “Know your place bitch!”, and put Indonesia firmly out of the running. One down I wonder how many more.</p><p></p><p>The Collective Civilians of Indonesia (CCI) hold an emergency meeting after the last city falls. The collective, made up of merchants, admirals, fishermen, workers, and other civilians, discuss what to do now that their country is gone. Some propose they join Timor-Leste, others say they want to escape to Afghanistan or Bengal. The stressed times even cause a few fights to break out. One mother, a member of Settler Group 02, proclaims that the only thing she knows is that she will keep her children safe no matter what. They’re the only words that get unanimous support throughout the meeting.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Arapaho finally takes Uashat with an immense amount of robot mech units, but Poundmaker gathers together quite the counter force and prepares a stronger defense of Tigwaxti, though Matimekosh looks to fall eminently. If the Cree can get enough naval units to take Wabasca then it’ll be tough for Arapaho to retake it, but Arapaho has a lot of planes. Mohave still hasn’t joined the war.</p>"

      scene_title: "Mohave Still Hasn’t Joined The War"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>Mohave still hasn’t joined the war. </p><p></p><p>There’s approximately 0 Arapaho units on the border. Now there aren’t many Mohave units either but there are more, so if these two go to war it will be Mohave’s to fuck up the start of. Anyways, Mohave still hasn’t joined the war.</p>"

      scene_title: "The Taranto Takeback"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene17.jpg
      narration: "<p>Benevento finally falls but WHAT’S THAT IT’S GUISCARD FROM BEHIND WITH A STEEL TANK. HE’S SNUCK A TANK INTO TARANTO AND HAS SECURED PALERMO. A BIG STUMBLE FOR THE ANGOLAN OFFENSE IN THIS ROYAL RUMBLE. DO THE NORMANS HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO PUSH THE ANGOLANS BACK AND KEEP THEIR EMPIRE? FIND OUT NEXT TIME!</p><p></p><p>(Btw read all that in a wrestling announcer voice)</p>"

      scene_title: "The Defenders of the Massagetae"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene18.jpg
      narration: "<p>A few lone Wiradjuri men stand on the barren snow of the small Antarctic land. With them, a lone Massagetae musketman sits, safe, protected. The Wiradjuri don’t know why they were given this task, they wanted to try and keep fighting the Inca, but instead they got put here, tasked with defending this icy shithole and the single Central Asian gunman. One officer of the artillery battalion, speaking with a field gun officer, is caught remarking “Did they send us here to die? They didn’t give us the means to even start up a settlement! Damned Windradyne! I’ve got half a mind to just shoot the Massagetaen next time he’s in range. Maybe we can get some more fish to ourselves…”</p><p></p><p>Overall a pretty cheery place. Also I did check this isn’t the sub hiding spot, this is a separate unsettled Antarctic piece of land.</p>"

      scene_title: "Wabasca Wanting"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene19.jpg
      narration: "<p>Wabasca regains some health but gets further surrounded by Cree ships, though to be fair three of those are subs and two are carriers so not really the most effective for a naval invasion. The Cree are really running out of naval units now as I count only two ships in this image that can actually do something, but at least Arapaho isn’t building any more. Also, the Arapaho take Matimekosh but lose quite a few mechs. Mohave still hasn’t joined the war. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene20.jpg
      narration: "<p>Angolan nukes fly high as they bomb the shit out of Taranto and Palermo, and the Normans look to have nuked Catania in return. Now the Normans are really running out of units and the Angolans still have another wave right behind them. Will they end at the coast or will they go even further into Europe?</p>"

      scene_title: "Too Many Drones"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode35-scene21.jpg
      narration: "<p>We finally find out why Bengal hasn’t been building up that many troops: They’ve been saving the space for the Han drone army. Honestly this is one of the first armies that has carpeted enough to then go on to carpet another civ’s empire. So they just have this mega army apparently, would love to get a shot of their empire. But I think it’s important to note that, at least based on last episode’s stats, which is only 9 turns old, Han is losing 5k gold a turn. They are absolutely churning out units enough to fill up Bengal’s land despite being so in the hole. The fuck is Wu doing with his economy???</p>"

      narration: "<p>Arapaho gathers their army for another push and sends so many planes at the Cree army. So many red numbers here indicating units and cities that are being bombed. I count 92 Arapaho air units here. I wonder how many are nukes?</p>"

      narration: "<p>Kayapo builds the Bionic Tower, and not in their capital this time. The Bionic Tower gives +2 Great Scientist points, and makes it so that specialists in cities consume half the amount of food and produce half the amount of unhappiness. This is a really really strong wonder but also lmao Kayapo you aren’t going to save yourselves with this. </p><p></p><p>Also no I never did play with Bionicles so the title here is just a random quote I found online that I hope has some significance or something.</p>"

      narration: "<p>We get a nice zoomed in shot of the absolute devastation nukes have brought to the tundra wastes of Alaska. Not only are the cities taking big damage from them, but the units will take a lot of damage (both in getting destroyed by the nukes and the fallout chipping them down). The people here are suffering immensely from the war, but war never ends. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Good job on carpeting up your lands Anglo-Dutch! Just one minor issue: That is Greenlandish troops, not Anglo-Dutch troops… Look, I’m a big supporter of the Anglo-Dutch, I really love orange as should be obvious. But right now, it’s kinda feeling like the way to stop Brandenburg would be for Greenland to take over A-D and not the other way around (though A-D does have a big tech advantage). Either way, one of these two needs to take over the other to really stand a chance against BB. </p>"

      narration: "<p>It’s not quite a full on shot of Han, but it does show their gigantic army and how it absolutely dwarfs the Kokang army and the Mohave army. Now, the Han army is also very nice in having a mix of Drone UAVs and that modern armor. Whoever they attack next is gonna be in for some pain… At least until the completely broken Han economy which is stalling their tech completely sets them even further behind then they already are.  </p>"

      narration: "<p>An Incan naval seaman stands on the brow of their cyber ship, looking out on the empty waters near Inti Watana and Taumarunui. The serene waters of the Pacific have called to them all their life, got a bit lucky in being drafted for the fleet during the Kayapo war but late enough to not be sent east. Saved from the action, they’re content to live their dream at sea, enjoying the slow rocking of the ship, reveling in the banter among crewmates. Threat from the west is nearly non-existent, with only a few Timor-Leste ships nearby. It’s as good a life as can be.</p><p></p><p>Sidenote: Yes the city in the mod is spelled wrong, google put the red squiggle underneath so I looked it up and the mod has it wrong. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We get a nice shot of the triple point between Kayapo, the Inca, and the Muisca. All of them have a spattering of units but not much. One thing to note however is that Kayapo has like 10 techs on the Inca, who have like almost 20 on the Muisca. But Kayapo doesn’t really have the strength to make a super army themselves, so a joint attack would be quite devastating especially after the previous one. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Palermo and Catania swap hands as Capua falls to the red and another attack is launched at Benevento. The Normans are doing quite well in keeping Angola from getting too far in their offensive, having made peace with Yugoslavia really helped them refocus themselves in just one direction. Also Yugoslavia is building up a nice little army again, maybe they can attack a second time, spice things up. </p>"

Now I’m not entirely sure because I may not have checked the most clearly, but I’m pretty sure this is the first Giant Death Robot build so far. Super strong, they are a great way to spend Uranium that’s not just nuking others to oblivion. </p>"

The troops are sweltering beyond belief, used to the freezing cold of the Arctic they are now forced to suffer through the highs of the desert in July. Truly awful conditions for the sprawling Greenland army. </p><p></p><p>Also I totally missed the Greenland/Brandenburg vs. Chad war until I went to the next slide and saw it, so now I’m back. The Greenlandish troops in Yemen have a second objective besides their first objective of “Survive”: “Survive, but against another army”.

Though they do have a settler on Hokkaido that can resettle one of the lost cities. But wew, the Cree are fully out of the running and just an errant declaration from the Gokturks away from succumbing to the world and joining the sub.

But she stayed passionate about it, her settler organization setting up a technically illegal settlement in the empty space right in the middle of the quad cities of Luanda, Cabinda, Ambriz, and Lubango, on the grassland and jungle that only had a small trading post there. Otchali had been speaking out about the Angolan state’s egregious lack of space usage and how they fail to give people the necessary homes to live in while letting so much land go empty. Some say it’s for environmental reasons, others dispute that and say it’s for official’s private lands. Either way, the lands run empty and people need homes, and some are willing to fight for that.</p><p></p><p>Anyways Angola’s lands are missing a whole lot of military, and also is somehow missing improvements on many tiles.

What I mean all this to say, I don’t know how big Tuva’s army right now is, but it very well may be a whole lot bigger than Han’s due to the greater land area of Tuva, and this is probably putting them at 0 science like Han as well. </p><p></p><p>Opposite the Tuvan horde of drones is Turkey, who has basically no army, but also they are 27 techs ahead (85 vs 112, though the max is 122) and have nearly 3x the production (9.1k vs 3.5k).

I have no idea how the stats compare between stuff like them, the nexuses, or other units, so let’s just hope they are pretty good and give them a nice thumbs up good job Tupac.</p>"

      narration: "<p>We end this episode on a shot of the former battleground of the Kayapo-Muisca war, Kayapo returning to being devoid of units. </p><p></p><p>Well it’s been a pleasure to narrate this episode for my second narration of CBRX3, I hope you all enjoyed my stream of conscious and weird rambling. It’s been a long episode, 89 turns, we’ve seen carpets grow and wars fought but not actually that much action tbh. Only one civ died despite the length, and really only a few civs got any focus. So I hope I was able to make this enjoyable. I don’t know if I was able to write as many lore bits as I wanted to, but oh well, it is what it is. Anyways, don’t trust the words of this mad girl and you’re all really gay, I don’t make the rules. Happy Pride all!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Mohave still hasn’t joined the war.</p>"
