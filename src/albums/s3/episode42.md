  narration: "<p>Taking a moment to view this wonderful map by Vihreaa, we can still see the bane of power rankers everywhere, Yongle, chilling in East Asia. Their old enemy Han is less than half the size of Yongle’s revived city-state; it is unbelievable how far they have fallen in such a short time.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode42-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>The government of the City-State of Avi Mota traces its lineage directly from the original settlers of the region thousands of years ago. Since ancient times the city’s upper crust has maintained a highly stratified society, which in the time of Avi Motan expansion we can see reflected in the creation of its puppetted tributaries. Avi Motan culture though is far removed from its original Mohave roots, as thousands of years of cultural exchange in the region have created a people truly unique. Protests on the part of the Avi Motan populace against the unilateral decisions by the City-State’s old guard to expand Avi Mota’s borders through bloody conquest have recently resulted in the establishment of the Sister Cities program, allowing a select few cities greater freedoms, such as Nar Le, with Avi Mota serving as a “first among equals”.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Avi Mota is keeping most of its forces close by as city garrisons, increasingly fearful of the Turkish threat.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yemen is no longer unhappy, as they sat on a neutral 0 happiness at the end of last episode! Either the conditions in Aden were so bad the whole empire became unhappy in aggregate, or the rest of Yemen really really hated the Adenites. Whatever the case, after last episode’s devastating flipfest dropped the city from 54 to just 4 pops, Yemen’s chances of launching a successful counterattack for Sana’a are resting 6 feet under alongside the rest of Aden.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Afghanistan has a massive force on the outskirts of Linqiu - While the city is undamaged, Wu must be shaking in their boots as these troops alone could wipe Han off the map.</p><p></p><p>Yongle’s capital is in the deep red.. If he holds out just a little longer he could rise in the final rankings as long as he outlasts Tuva and/or Han.

  narration: "<p>As Aden flips again, Tuva is reduced to just 1 city. Afghanistan isn’t even trying to compete for the free real estate - by refusing to act Durrani allows Ataturk to open up an even larger border in Northeast Asia, putting Afghanistan’s East Asian holdings at greater risk.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And so it is that Tuva perishes in 16th place. Tuva’s very promising early game earned them many supporters, however they never managed to overcome a strange aversion to science and poor land that resulted in their military falling egregiously behind the times. Even so, their absolutely massive military was filled with bodies, slowing the Turkish advance through their sheer quantity alone through multiple episodes of Total War, while at the same time conquering eastward to buy themselves more time. In the end, they just couldn’t make up that deficit. F </p>"

  narration: "<p>Yongle’s knees tremble at the approaching gene-altered monstrosities. At the time of his first death Ming’s ships were made of wood and their guns weren’t automated. Yanked from that age and reinstated nearly 1000 years later into a world so vastly advanced from his own as to appear a dystopia erected merely for dark gods and their games. Cities piling people atop one another in buildings that skewer the heavens, lights that never go out, manmade monsters tearing into each other on cross-continental battlefields, all enabled by the production of pure power from what his advisors explained to him were facilities housing miniature suns. This age was never meant for Yongle; beleaguered, he is escorted back to the sub. 15th place for Yongle.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the land FDR’s people once called “Florida”, the worlds largest city Cuscowilla’s floodwalls climb ever higher - both to keep the waters out, and to keep the teeming masses contained and controlled within. A city this populous defies all explanation (a staggering irl equivalent of 468.66 Million!) and so drastic measures must be taken to keep the populace pacified. The conditions in Cuscowilla are too terrible to comprehend from our perception of reality.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In stark contrast, once the most populous city on the cylinder, Kremoro is an irradiated ruin. The only survivors of the Incan campaign took shelter in the cities vast network of bomb shelters, but in the face of future-worlds units, more than half of those even collapsed. Kremoro’s position as host of Skynet and a vast number of the world’s greatest wonders necessitates the Inca bring this city back online as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>If you look closely, you can see Incan soldiers ushering Kayapo citizens out of their bunkers and back to work.

  narration: "<p>Aside from Khandagayty, Avi Mota has twice the population of any city on this slide north of the mountains.

  narration: "<p>Wu’s story comes to a close today as Afghanistan eliminates them in 14th place. Quickly positioning themselves as a China frontrunner early on, Han rose to prominence in an extremely well-fought war where their superior tactics easily overwhelmed the Gokturks and took them out of the running for a top finish. However, as time went on they stagnated, unable to break fortress Kokang, even with a military advantage. At the outbreak of Total War their land was washed in nuclear hellfire and much of their military ceased to exist, in part due to the correction of the drone bug and in part due to brutal campaigns on all sides. However, to be killed by an endgame longshot.. Wu would be rolling in their grave right now if they weren’t safely relocated to the sub. F</p><p></p>"

The only remaining civs that didn’t are Afghanistan, Mali, Brandenburg, Castile, Yemen, and the Gokturks, and in general these civs are underdogs to dead meat at this stage.

Xiangping has already fallen to half health, however many Avi Motan biotroopers are within range to come to the Sister City’s defense.

  narration: "<p>As the submarine’s eye glides over the Turkish core, we are treated with a grim reminder that nowhere on the cylinder is safe from nuclear fallout. However where many regions have been torn asunder by monsters and missiles, deserts glassed by constant conflict, here many live normal everyday lives. Up until Total War, Turkey proper hadn’t seen real warfare for hundreds of years - it will take more to break this strong people.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Turkey has finally started building up a proper army, as many of its core cities are fully ringed by Future Worlds units.</p>"
