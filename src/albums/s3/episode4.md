    narration: "<p>Hello Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to episode 4 of CBRXS3! The series where we watch AI’s play Civilization 5.  This is going to be a computer let's play, and when I say ”let's play” I use that term pretty loosely because these AI’s are absolute idiots in this game. You're gonna see lots of fails, you're gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping… So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of coco. I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed. Let me take a sip… Ahh, that's some good cider!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Insert: ‘’American Dreams 3: A Helping Hand’’ by Orangechrisy. What might seem like two powers cleverly collaborating on the surface, is in actuality an intense rivalry between two squabbling chickens, as Orange’s latest piece so masterfully displays. Note the minimalist, post-modern style of the work, featuring well-defined black lines which give form to these ball-like creatures, which so abstractly represent the very essence of civilization. A true masterpiece, if you’d ask me.</p>"

With the dockyards of their capital being blocked by enemy ships as well as Central American troops hiding in the Cuban jungles, the Seminole stand no real chance of regaining this city.</p>"

This means that the Massagetae can churn these fellows out like there’s no tomorrow, making quick work of the invading spearmen.

Very cool, if only Castille followed a different religion than the Dutch.

Glory to Uganda!’’ His men cheered, although with an audible hint of confusion. Arwa al Sulayhi shrugs. She takes those.</p>"

The war is still going fairly well for Egypt, with Assyria barely having any defensive forces left. Actually taking the cities might still prove difficult though, as the Egyptian armies are slowly running out of steam, with few reinforcements on the way. If Atatürk wants some of that peachy Assyrian booty as well, now would be an excellent time to join in.</p>"

The Norman scribes tell legends about their ancestors living in Anglo-Dutch lands, but moving out in order to become mercenaries. Regardless of their origins, these Normans are now very determined to make all of the Mediterranean theirs. Thus, they have set their sights on the Turkish city of Izmir. The city will prove nigh impossible to capture with just ships, but if Robert Guiscard decides to organize an infamous Norman landing party, things could get interesting.</p>"

The effect of this has been a massive spread of their culture all throughout the Amazon rainforest, inspiring local peoples to quickly assimilate into the Kayapó empire. This means that their cities, although few in number, now have massive cultural borders which rival even their most sizable neighbors. I guess you don’t need length, you just need girth.
