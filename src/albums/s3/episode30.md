      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene01.jpg
      narration: "<p>Greetings, People of Submarine, and moukarimakka? This is Homusubi, ex-modder, ex-power ranker, recently ex-gaijin, and hopefully, at some point in my life, something that starts with a different prefix. I’ve been inactive recently but was persuaded to come back, and what a ride it’s been; I hope you enjoy your weekly Turks and Timorese session as much as I do. I think it’s this point where I’m supposed to say “let’s get right to it”, but you know as well as I do that there are four more slides before we do. So without further ado, let’s move vaguely in the direction of It.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene02.jpg
      narration: "<p>We start, of course, with this week’s sole map, courtesy of Vihreaa. What stands out to me here is just how small Europe is, frankly. We see our top-tier powers - essentially, anyone beginning with T plus the Mohave - span across most of a continent each, while civs like Ireland and the Anglo-Dutch that may seem pretty notable are actually not that much bigger than Rumpo de la Plata. I guess the sea helps, to be fair, but still.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene03.jpg
      narration: "<p>I’d like to use this slide to highlight ECH’s Seabricks Schoolhouse series. Sure, it’s not actually him doing the videos, but apparently finding decent-quality ones about obscure civilisations that aren’t inaccurate or varying types of questionable takes work, and I’ve gotta admire the sheer perseverance involved in doing both something like this and various statistical analyses at the same time without getting many comments or anything in return. So go on, watch them, get educated, and let us all know what you think. I know I’m a hypocrite, sorry, I just have an awful lot going on.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Obligatory, but at least in my case actually heartfelt, shoutout to CBR’s patrons, here to make sure we build a CBR that stands the test of time. No really, I consider some of these people to be friends in their own right, and you should absolutely make their job easier via Ko-Fi if you have anything to spare. Why all donations have to go via the former UN secretary general beats me, but who am I to question it?</p>"

      narration: "<p>The top three are Turkey and Timor, staying where they are, followed by Mohave, up two from last week. I’m going to show Kayapo’s slide, though, to highlight the fact that the PRs after twenty-nine episodes still have no idea what to think of these guys - you can tell confusion levels by the “deviation” score in the top row. Now, this time for real, let’s get into it.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene06.jpg
      narration: "<p>America, 2023. The once great power is facing existential crises on all fronts: increasingly powerful fascists, dangerously surging levels of public happiness, and unceasing artillery bombardment from Arapaho forces. You know, just like every other timeline. The invaders pretty clearly have the upper hand here, the air supremacy making the tricksy Great Lakes terrain easier to handle, although I do wonder about their decision to build a vanguard out of anti-aircraft guns when fighting an enemy without any aircraft. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene07.jpg
      narration: "<p>Brandenburg take a leaf out of their OTL successors’ book by plonking down a citadel and pinching some of Burgundy while their weaker neighbours were distracted. However, Willy has gone back to his old habits here, forgetting he’s not a Viking and pouring hammer mana into an almost entirely destroyer-based carpet while letting Yugoslav peacekeepers flood Westphalia just in case Tito feels like round two. To be fair, though, I would be terrified were I Ireland or King Billy - not to be confused with Willy - to his west. Nobody can accuse the Prussian Beige of lacking melee units, after all.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Olive Yang sends Han a three-city three-fingered salute, capturing Longbian and Kaifeng while reclaiming the apparently flipped Wanchanshu. The Maroon Mountain Tomboys’ strategy loos to hold the Han infantry back with row after row of artillery and hope the superior Han production base doesn’t eventually overwhelm them. I could make an OTL reference here, but I’m actually backing Kokang, so best not artillery my side in the foot here. I fancy Olive’s chances more around the increasingly shaky Chongjin.</p>"

      scene_title: "El Pueblo Vencido… Um That’s Not Right"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene09.jpg
      narration: "<p>After years of war, the newly rekindled fire in the hearts of the Popular Chilean workers’ front starts to sputter. With each flip of Rancagua, the balance of forces around it looks increasingly rainforest green, and the situation doesn’t look too different at sea, where the Chilean navy of privateers - I guess that’s one way of seizing the means of production? - cower off Santiago, praying that Allende doesn’t give the order to face off against Kayapo’s latest abominable innovation. I am talking, of course, about what is perhaps a CBR first - aircraft carriers with actual aircraft on them. Who’d have thought it?</p>"

      scene_title: "Apopkalypse Now"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene10.jpg
      narration: "<p>The Arapaho tank battalion’s commander looks around at the smoking ruins of the once-great city of Apopka, taking their seconds of respite while they could, in between preparations for the inevitable assault by their American counterparts over the vast business complex southeast of the fires. Perhaps, they thought, these were built by Roosevelt in a moment of forgetfulness, failing to remember that there are no walls in Wall Street. The strict scheduling also makes sure they don’t question their mission too much. Gross national happiness in the hundreds, they remind themselves as they pet their beloved nationalism prairie dog, cannot be allowed to stand. It’s just not right. It’s just not neutral. Resolve strengthened, they return to directing the construction of earthworks salvaged from the flaming rubble, each worker in the Arapaho empire’s newest regiment making sure to keep the line of their mouth as straight as an emoji.</p>"

      scene_title: "You OK There, English?"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene11.jpg
      narration: "<p>Only about two and a half of the remaining empires can be called anglophone, although perhaps on the cylinder anglo- is not the correct prefix; hibernophone might be a better word, a language standardised to the texts of Oriental Orthodoxy and the immortal Mick Collins’s Cork accent. Either way, every other civ is probably laughing at this language’s way of doing things, especially when it comes to the latest in naval melee technology. “Mohave Destroyer” sounds like an appellation given to hopeful Arapaho generals, but in fact it means precisely the opposite. Why am I rambling? Cause there’s not much else to say, is there? Sure, the Gokturks declaring on North Korea would be big, at least for the latter, but since when do these plotting things actually mean anything?</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene12.jpg
      narration: "<p>FDR isn’t going down that quickly. His tank-based army has set up a line outside occupied Chicago to defend the heartland, and it looks like Apopka and Holsteinsborg are still heavily contested. America also seems to have been investing in an air force, although given the state of Windsor, it may be too little too late to keep the hope of the Brown New Deal alive.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Surrounded by a grand assembly of turrets, androids, and of course companion and edgeless safety cubes galore, Prince-Comrade Irataba swings his katana and ceremonially cuts the ribbon in front of the mountain tunnel leading to the Mohave’s new Enrichment Centre. The commissar he has delegated to run the facility is said to have some interesting ideas for new siege weapons; some locals swear they saw him close to the site of a major conflagration on a citrus farm in the Californian Central Valley a few weeks before the Centre commenced testing.</p>"

      scene_title: "Pampan Circumstance"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene14.jpg
      narration: "<p>As the sub’s periscope swivels round to point at South America once more, we see peace has finally been declared between the OTL non-aligned leftists playing in dark red and their green and yellow clad opponents… wait, why are the Chileans and Kayapo still fighting? Oh. Right. We can see here that Raoni has all but united Argentina, a feat that Jose de San Martin was never able to achieve.</p><p></p><p>There’s not much else to say here, this is going about as one might predict from the last slide of this war, so may our eyes drift to the top left of the screen and our minds wonder how exactly a progressive nomadic horde works - or rather, looking at the Kilwa’s happiness problem, doesn’t.</p>"

      scene_title: "Myanmore"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene15.jpg
      narration: "<p>Kokang peaces out after a Han counterattack half-reverses previous northern advancement, leaving everyone’s favourite opium-pipe-toting girlboss up three cities. I really don’t know how to feel about this, I’ll be honest. Maybe it’s my inbuilt pessimism speaking, but it feels a lot like Olive has just pulled off a perfect midgame war when it’s long past the midgame. Taking three cities off a larger power and then peacing out before the tide turns, especially when the gains may have put Kokang on a track to technologically eclipsing Han given enough time, that’s good behaviour.</p><p></p><p>The trouble is, as we’re seeing with America on the other side of the map, it just doesn’t cut it to be a medium-sized power any more. Kokang needs to go big or go home to avoid getting blindsided by the Timorese or even by a king from across the water. Go on, eat Bengal, you know you want to. I, for one, am sick of hearing the phrase “paper tiger” used in like every power rankings episode.</p><p></p><p>Side note: did you know Olive Yang was alive right up till 2017? Confused? OK, good, let’s move on.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>In a somewhat amusing albeit predictable development in eastern Europe, the only civ around to have a properly carpetty carpet is the Kyivan Rus’, who are still using muskets as their scouts report what appear to be giant mushrooms occasionally spawning around The Turk’s military installations.</p><p></p><p>Here to distract the Kyivans from their inevitable fate is Burt Bacharach, who Wikipedia tells me was OTL an important figure in mid-twentieth-century American pop music, known for unusual chords and choices of instrument. Hang on, if he’s pop, the things he does stop being unusual, don’t they? Beats me. No pun intended.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene17.jpg
      narration: "<p>Xanana Gusmao shows us what Kokang should have done by continuing, against all odds, to push deeper into the Australian bush in the hopes of claiming the fertile land at the end of the rainless rainbow. Like last episode, Pukearuhe is proving a surprisingly tough nut to crack for our boys in red, while the south, despite its bays and inlets and Wiradjuri reinforcements, looks to be ripe for the Timorese taking.</p><p></p><p>Even leaving aside the whole 61st thing, it’s worth pointing out that the locally victorious Australian civ last time around, the Kulin, made it to fifth place by maintaining their continent as a fortress until the very end. This time, no such luck for the Wiradjuri. Australia bodied before turn 500? What is going on?</p>"

      scene_title: "Now You’re Thinking With…"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene18.jpg
      narration: "<p>The inhabitants of Wiradjuri Narrungdera had been curious for a while now about the glowing orange ellipse that had appeared on the white walls of their commercial district when a Mohave convoy had passed by to the southwest. Some, but by no means all, of their questions were answered in July 2026, when the ellipse turned hollow and some confused Central American-looking people in regulation Mohave garb wandered out. They proceeded to camp just outside of the city; Wiradjuri spies listening in on their conversations in heavily-accented Mohave report a lot of hopeful discussion about Timorese arsonists.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene19.jpg
      narration: "<p>Emperor Idi Amin wakes up with a start. Not, in the usual way, from a misfired musket outside the door, or his own stomach rumbling from a lack of fallen enemies to eat various limbs off of, but with the realisation that he is actually relevant for the first time in many centuries. Before anyone gets too excited, though, this is only indirect relevance. Two civs have declared war on Idriss Deby, and one of them is Kilwa. Two medium-sized powers in Africa going to war might be quite interesting on a good day, certainly more than the steamrolls we’ve been expecting, but unfortunately, Uganda separates the two.</p><p></p><p>What else is there to say? Oh, Mbarara, the city on the Indian Ocean coast famous for having been flipped approximately 6.02 times ten to the 23 times before Yemen got tired and nicked it off both flippers, is now almost twice as big as Uganda’s largest remaining city. Take from that what you will.</p>"

      narration: "<p>FDR’s happy fascists have seemingly stabilised the frontline for the time being, managing to push back to the extent that Holsteinsborg is on the front and Apopka is behind it. They seem to have lost a few planes, unless they’re in Cuscowilla again, but apart from that, not bad, Frank. Help might be coming from Laibach, which I thought was the German name for the capital of Slovenia (if America can get towns to move and shield their troops from Arapaho fire, we really shouldn’t be counting them out), but is apparently a Slovenian band that formed in the late 20th century. Think, what happens when you fool around with totalitarian imagery Rammstein-style but do it in an actual authoritarian country. Kinda interesting. I will leave this slide with an actual quote from Laibach’s Wikipedia page:</p><p></p><p>“The performance was eventually interrupted by the police, forcing the group to leave the stage after the appearance of a penis and Josip Broz Tito at the same time on the screens.”</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene21.jpg
      narration: "<p>We get a shot of the almost-empty Tuvan core, including what was once a deadly battleground before the Tuvans rolled over a former #1-ranked power. There honestly isn’t anything else to say, so let’s just ramble about Tuva for a bit.</p><p></p><p>Despite what this might look like, Tuva’s army isn’t that bad for a top 10 power, if you discount the top 4, steaming ahead of everyone else by quite a way in most things if you look at the stats sheet. Tuva is fifth and is roughly in the middle of the large gap in power between fourth (Mohave) and sixth (Arapaho). Tuva is a relatively high-skilled, low-population economy; it has the highest production per citizen of any civ on the cylinder, and the highest gross production to boot, but it actually has a very low population by great power standards, and their food output doesn’t look like it’ll remedy that any time soon. This has a ton of knock-on effects, but the most notable is their sub-Bengal tech level. Paradoxically, unpopulated Tuva may be turning into a zerg rush civ.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode30-scene22.jpg
      narration: "<p>This is a similar thing to the last slide, except aimed further to the east and showing two civs instead of one. There’s also less to say about the civs, even though there are two of them. The Han, sitting at tenth in the stats sheet, don’t really have a particularly strong or weak point: they’re just, there, with a weirdly mixed military record. The Gokturks, meanwhile, are in every way a worse Tuva: same tech deficit, same relatively low population, but without the sheer productivity of their western neighbours.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Here we see a selection of mechanical Turks, largely piloted by real ones. We were talking about statistical rankings for the last two slides, and well, Ataturk is way out there on top in that regard, and according to ECH they apparently had 99 nukes at the start of this episode. Here to support them is Faust, not the literary antihero but a seventies band active in the newly divergent contemporary West German musical movement that later became known as Krautrock.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Mohave have sent a large party of scouting units armed with long thin retractable thingies to explore the distant, mysterious island of Further North Holland. The curious Dutch locals keep a close eye on the newcomers and especially their devices - various radio signals from around the world have told them to paint over any white surfaces they can find in response. While this work is undertaken with the aid of massive paintbrushes, ordinary-sized ones have also become popular in the Anglo-Dutch despotic tribal confederacy, thanks to the work of OTL Indonesian expressionist Affandi.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Heil Frank! The Americans are pushing back the Arapaho! Holsteinsborg is slightly less damaged than last time we saw it, Apopka appears to still be flying the white and blue (the red will get added by this war, no doubt), and most impressively, despite overwhelming Arapaho air superiority, the plucky little fascists have broken through the lines and rolled their tanks back into Chicago. Maybe their troops are a bit more advanced than the enemy now; Ada Lovelace OTL was a computer scientist in the early 1800s who wrote what would now be considered programs for Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine, a feat rendered all the more impressive by a) the Engine not physically existing at the time and b) Ada being female in the early 1800s with all that entails.</p>"

Are they envious of their compatriots under Timorese occupation, living in more advanced, populated and better defended cities than Ulundi?

Well, OK, a mountain is like a really massive pointy thing made of rock… wait I only need to do those when it’s highlighting great people, got it.

Many a night goes by without anything, except the occasional neighbour’s window, standing between them and some of the clearest skies on the cylinder. Recently, though, things have been different; people have reported brilliant flashes on the horizon, and a deep sense of foreboding whenever they ponder what happened.

Yugoslavia, among other civs, is apparently a progressive military dictatorship, while Idriss Deby, OTL a general in the Toyota War before taking control of Chad, has allowed his government to become influenced by virulently anti-car forces.

The sub appears to have been taken over by Mohave left-wingers, perhaps with the aid of another portal gun. Perhaps most amusingly, however, is Yemen, where frustrations over Turks moving south to seek a lower cost of living have led to the rise of the Anti-Immigration Society of Yemen. The Turk has apparently responded to this by pinching bits of land off of Yemen with citadels and chuckling “who’s the immigrant now, huh?”. </p>"

Here to distract the Swahili on the Swahili Coast are Dexys Midnight Runners, an eighties band from Birmingham. One could assume that the gap between the Y and S here, far from being the fault of a misplaced end single quotation not supported by the Civ font, must be an artistic flair designed to give Dexys a more alternative image, but no: OTL Dexys actually doesn’t have an apostrophe at all. So this may be a double failure. And yes, there is an argument that the apostrophe or lack thereof is more interesting than Kilwa at the moment.</p>"

Holding it seems very possible, as much as the Greenlanders coming in for another swoop at Tralee would help, but Mick seems to have some decent defences at Galway that will be hard for our orange contender to break through.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Massagetae make peace with Lithuania; I told you it wasn’t a big spoiler. It may seem premature, but this is the surest way for Tomyris to get a peace deal and be absolutely sure her negotiators won’t give away a city. Massagetae refugees have been spotted in the Indian Ocean, presumably occupying the closest sea tiles available to the now-closed Lithucaspian, and also presumably with the aid of some itinerant Mohave. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Speaking of the Mohave, they’re engaged in a staring contest with the Arapaho across the Rockies. Our western contender has the marginally larger land force not currently running full pelt towards the Appalachian semi-meatgrinder (perhaps we could call it a meat tenderiser?), but there isn’t much in it; in the ocean, meanwhile, the Mohave are clearly top dogs. I wonder if any of that fleet will find its way to Irish shores in the near future.</p>"

We also see the entirety of rump Indonesia, which could likely take Semarang and then Phnom Penh if it wanted to - an impressive feat if they could manage it, and yet one that would do absolutely nothing for their eventual chances when Best Timor comes knocking.</p>"

The Brown New Deal was incomplete; not enough policies had been put in place to break up the might of Big Carrier, and America was paying the price for his tardiness.

      narration: "<p>Ireland loses Tralee but reclaims Dublin, ensuring non-ideological freedom on the Emerald Isle for a few more months to come. This gives the Greenlanders a decent shot at taking the city this time, and whoever takes it is likely to keep it thanks to the lack of Irish melee units left standing. Unless I’ve misread the unit icons, that also applies for Tralee. If this were to happen, Ireland’s last holdout would be Scotland, which would ever-so-slightly echo the latter’s OTL history.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Here we see two more powers squaring off against each other, specifically, Bengal and Kokang. Kokang has more military and one more tech in hand than their western neighbours, but on most other stats - output of hammers, apples, and notably, beakers - the advantage goes to the tiger clan.</p><p></p><p>Note how Kokang, despite being one of EmeraldRange’s celebrated Burma civs, has managed not to hold any OTL core Burmese territory. Admittedly, this may be due to a Bengali citadel, which has put a poppy field under their control. Although, maybe this is Olive’s tactic to get ‘em all hooked.</p>"

      narration: "<p>We now take a look at the section of the cylinder which, since last part, I have taken to calling the Land of the Rising Schadenfreude. All the civs on the archipelago have reinforced their colonies pretty well, even the Mohave, who have 20 planes stationed on Honshu alone. Our last remaining stooge is still sitting in Tajihi-Sarugake, hoping, perhaps ironically, that nobody notices his existence. Anton Reicha, an influential Czech-French classical composer and friend of Beethoven, is perhaps a fitting choice of Great Person for a silent civ, as he never published anything and was only recognised for his avant-garde musical ideas after his death.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Dublin falls once more, and according to the minimap, Billy is once again the beneficiary. Collins is now banished beyond the wall - not Hadrian’s, either, but the more northerly Antonine. Whether Collins’s Fenian UUs, defensively inclined but with the offensive strength of a rifleman, can stand up to the less numerous but more advanced orange army, is an open question. Lapu-Lapu was a local chieftain from what is now the central Philippines who lived in the 1500s, slew Ferdinand Magellan and discouraged further Spanish colonisation for the next few decades. He is now a Filipino folk hero. The real question, though, is whether his island expertise will allow the Irish to make the most of the massive pile of wheat off the coast of Moray.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Kayapo core is as it always is - silent, far more civilian units than military, well-forested, yet deadly to anyone who dares cross Raoni. For anyone welcome, though, the environmentalist horde has always struck me as by far the nicest place to live on the cylinder, tucked away from all the bloodshed. Thus, the name of the Great Musician, or rather early 90s American band, highlighted here seems delightfully ironic.</p>"

At this rate, the Timorese may be in danger of doubling their already impressive empire within a single part. All must cower. Except possibly Ataturk.</p>"

      narration: "<p>FDR pulls a rabbit out of his hat, pushing the Arapaho menace right back to the Washington-Chicago midpoint and commencing the manufacture of B-17 bombers. Could these be the machines that change the tide of the war? As much as I’d like to think so, probably not; in human hands, extra evasion might be pretty useful, but the AI isn’t known for using bombers against units, making them an offensive unit put into use in the middle of a defensive war. Ah well, the extra 5 strength doesn’t hurt.</p>"

She was one of the first, though not THE first, person to invent a ‘frequency hopping’ device used to make torpedoes jam-proof. That… actually sounds like something that could be useful against the Arapaho, fair play.</p>"

The (0,0) point on the cylinder, while we’re on the subject, is apparently somewhere around the Khorat Plateau, in Kokang territory. Anyway, other than Galvarino - I wonder if he’ll encounter the Massagetae ships in the Indian Ocean, and if so, what his reaction will be - the only other thing to note here is that N’Djamena is in the black and ready to fall to Savimbi.</p>"

The area so far has been a perfect little getaway for a homeless scout, as it has been Muiscan since it was first settled and they haven’t engaged in any wars across the Atlantic. Come to think of it, this entire front has been weirdly quiet given how close the Old and New Worlds are to each other and how long everyone has had ocean-faring ships for.</p>"

He is perhaps a fitting great person to be found in Jujuy, one of several Chilean cities to be relentlessly bombed by the Kayapo while stubbornly keeping their colours. Even Maipo is somehow still in Allende’s column. Elsewhere, we see the two ex-Kokang Antarctic colonies tread very different paths to each other, with Chilean Tar Shwe Htan being three times the size of its neighbour seemingly off the back of one fishing boat.</p>"

Things aren’t looking too different in New Zealand, with Te Tokanganui already in the yellow. The Mohave settler has portalled across the ocean, still waiting for Gusmao to explore his pyro side, but no such luck yet. That he has avoided happiness problems from all this is impressive in itself: he had a relatively low 71 happiness at the start of this part, compared to Ataturk’s 326.</p>"
