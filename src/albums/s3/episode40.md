  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste has finally returned to the top of the Power Rankings for the first time since Episode 32, and with rapid gains in both Africa and Southeast Asia, it’s not hard to see why. But the game is far from decided right now. Is their top spot truly warranted, or will another of the Elite Four rise to the occasion and kick Xanana Gusmao right back off his throne? Let’s find out!</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin with a shot of a Malian counter-offensive. Despite doing rather poorly last episode, here it seems like Mali is in position to make sizable gains against Turkey in northern Africa - in fact, they’ve already captured both Luana and Split! However, in the process, the Turkish forces have seized Pristina, putting Mali at a net gain of one city on this slide.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch continue their miraculous rampage through central Europe by capturing Potsdam. Brandenburg, once the undisputed strongest civ in Europe, has now been pushed back to Cottbus in Jutland and Oveido in Brittany, barely clinging onto their former core. Power Armor Infantry, the preferred unit of both the Anglo-Dutch and Mali, is a bit outdated at this point, but they still have a respectable 105 combat strength that lets them at least put up a fight against the units of the Elite Four.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>The brutal Timorese counter-offensive against the Inca in the Pacific seems to have petered out, allowing one cheeky Inca Biotrooper to snipe Djirriidhuray on mainland Australia. The city is poorly-defended, but Timor-Leste has precisely zero units in this shot, so perhaps this foothold could grow into something more given a bit of good luck.</p>"

  scene_title: "Maw of the Beast"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>The reason for the lack of units in Australia might just be that the Timorese forces are instead concentrated on other fronts, such as the Southeast Asian front seen here. Maw Hteik and Rangpur have been taken from Afghanistan as the Timorese continue their push up through Myanmar, and the final Bengali strongholds (namely Patna) are under heavy siege. There doesn’t seem to be much resistance being offered around these parts, so I expect heavy gains from Timor-Leste here.</p>"

  scene_title: "Capital Gains"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a spectacular show of defiance from a doomed empire, Yemen retakes their capital of Sana’a, alongside the city of Ghazni in inland Arabia! That latter city doesn’t seem like it’ll remain in their hands for very long, with Turkish troops already moving to retake it, but Sana’a looks pretty well-defended between the mountains and the half-dozen units nearby. Yemen’s not out just yet.</p>"

  scene_title: "Never Split the Party"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Split has been recaptured by Turkey, but a wider look at this front shows just how outmatched the Turks really are in Africa. The Turkish soldiers are easily outnumbered at least four to one on the front lines, and more Malian soldiers are already on their way while Turkish reinforcements are nowhere to be found. Split’s city defense may be high, but ‘ll probably won’t be sporting cream and red for much longer. Compared to Power Armor Infantry, Automatons are a fair bit weaker (90 combat strength vs. 105), but they gain a 20% strength boost when there’s a friendly unit adjacent to them. Too bad Turkey isn’t even trying to take advantage of this.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Cold Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Turks are faring much, much better on the Siberian front, where a swarm of Biotroopers is decimating the Tuvan cities of Iyzur and Khandagyty. To defend their wide-open core from this assault, the Tuvan military has prepared… one single Rocket Artillery. Biotroopers are the final form of the Marine, sporting 110 combat strength and the ability to enter rival territory along with having no penalty while embarked. They heal a bit after every turn, too, so while they aren’t quite the strongest unit in the game, they’re certainly one of the most reliable.</p>"

  scene_title: "Burmania"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Timorese advance into Afghanistan continues as Wanchanshu and Jianye come under attack. There aren’t many (or any, really) troops defending against this advance, but Timor-Leste has made the dubious decision to split their forces and attack several cities at once, which could prove disastrous. The Afghans, for their part, are committing their forces to the invasion of Han, which seems to be going smoothly - Guangzhou has fallen into the red.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Asir-ious Battle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Afghanistan is also committing forces to their front with Turkey, where the fighting is significantly more contested than any other front we’ve seen thus far. Afghan Biotroopers have done significant damage to Asir and are currently swarming Aral, but Turkey has a significant land and air presence in the region and doesn’t seem keen on letting the Afghans take Central Asia without a fight. I’d personally place my bets on an eventual Turkish victory here, but this front is certain to be a meatgrinder no matter who comes out on top.</p>"

  scene_title: "Going for the Green-and-Gold"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Inca doubters may want to reconsider their stance on the green giant’s chances - Tupac’s forces have consolidated and are launching a massive push to finally knock the Kayapo out of mainland South America once and for all. Kokraimoro has already fallen, and so has the Arapaho island city of To-Okooxeee-Ni’, which is another blow to anybody hoping for a southerly Arapaho invasion to happen any time soon. There’s still fierce Kayapo resistance around Gorotire, but in a horrifying twist for the empire once famed for its insurmountable tech advantage, the Inca seem to be about evenly matched in both quantity and quality of units.</p>"

  scene_title: "Shades of Algeria"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Mohave may have been kicked out of North America, but they’re not giving up just yet. Tashkurghan has fallen to this plucky rump state’s forces, and the rest of Japan looks soon to follow! Irataba’s secret? As a long-time fan of Japanese culture, he’s decided to employ a classic tactic of the Mori: daimyos. Every single Mohave tile in Japan is owned by a vassal lord tasked with protecting his land and supporting Irataba’s war effort. Surely, nothing could go wrong as a result of having more Great Generals than combat units!</p>"

  scene_title: "Afghani-Stand Up"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Afghanistan’s rampage through East Asia continues as they capture Guangzhou and Linzi from Han, along with Qarakhoja from Tuva. There’s actually a decently-sized Tuvan military force visible here, but it’s entirely made up of outdated ranged and siege units, so they won’t be taking Guzang any time soon. Meanwhile, several would-be Mohave daimyo who were unable to secure any land in Japan head west in search of the mythical long-lost Central Asian colonies, where they hope to find subjects of their own. WIth no units to guard them, however, their odds of success appear slim.</p>"

  scene_title: "Splitting Image"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Malian counter-offensive kicks into gear as Split, Pristina, Aouzou, and Sarh are all recaptured in one fell swoop! Taranto and Palermo look to be Mali’s next targets, but a few rogue Power Armor Infantry are going after Benevento and Akhetaten as well. Turkey’s cities may have high defense, but they completely lack any aircraft to stop the encroaching land forces - in fact, there are no planes or bombs on this front whatsoever.</p>"

  scene_title: "Crack Ship"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>A squadron of Timorese Arsenal Ships descends on the Yemeni Antarctic colony of Mukalla. This would be absolutely terrifying for the inhabitants of this comically-overpopulated outpost… if it wasn’t for the fact that Arsenal Ships can’t capture cities.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite the recapture of their capital city, the loss of Ghazni seems to have sent Yemen into a Dark Age, the last thing that an underdog needs. At least Sana’a is still holding strong!</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Exponential Grofe"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mohave’s Central Asian colony of Avi Mota is still clinging to life, against all odds. In fact, not only is it clinging to life, but it’s actually invading the Tuvan city of Izhma! Tuva has more important things to worry about, such as the Turkish forces that have just captured the cities of Khandagyty and Izyur, so the odds of this plucky little exclave growing one city bigger are looking pretty good… provided the Afghans don’t snipe the city first, of course.</p><p></p><p>Cheering the Mohave on is Ferde Grofe, who in our timeline was an American classical composer famed for writing the Grand Canyon Suite, among other compositions. One thing’s for sure, at least - if Avi Mota keeps this up, Mr. Grofe won’t have to worry about inspiration for a day in his life.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mali’s rampage continues as they capture Taranto, putting them closer than ever to reaching the Mediterranean once more! Turkey does seem to be putting up a bit of resistance, though - they evidently managed to flip both Split and Sarh, although Mali owns both cities again now.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Gory-tire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kayapo have retaken Kokraimoro, but it’s come at the cost of the much more vital city of Gorotire. A scattered force of Kayapo units still remains around the city, but it seems like protecting the heavily-damaged capital and forming a barrier around the Kayapo’s coastal holdings are taking priority right now. Things are still looking pretty even for now, but at this rate the fall of Kremoro seems imminent.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Iskor One for Turkey"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Iskor is the next Tuvan city to crumble in the face of the Turkish advance, along with Seinai just off-screen to the northwest. Aside from showing that the Turks are still a force to be reckoned with, this shot is also notable for revealing that there are quite literally zero Tuvan military units anywhere near the front lines. Not even a single plane or an outdated artillery unit. To see the empire that was only recently swarming Turkish cities with a seemingly-endless carpet reduced to… this, it’s almost enough to make me feel bad for them.</p>"

  scene_title: "Brittany Speared"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch take Oveido out of Brandenburg’s hands, reducing their presence on mainland Europe (outside of the Scandinavian Peninsula) to only Cottbus. That being said, there aren’t many Anglo-Dutch units left in this area, and Brandenburg does have a couple of melee ships around, so both Oveido and the Hague could hypothetically flip back in the near future.</p>"

  scene_title: "Kayapoh No"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kremoro has fallen! The Kayapo capital has finally shifted to a slightly darker green-and-gold palette, and this once-mighty civilization has been pushed back to their coastal holdings. There are still definitely enough Kayapo units in the area to flip it once or twice more, but given that the Inca now easily outnumber them, any flips won’t last long. Aside from being a momentous occasion given how impenetrable the Kayapo core has been for most of the game, this particular city capture also gives the Inca access to an absolute ton of wonders, including the Leaning Tower of Pisa (which grants +25% Great Person generation) and Skynet (which grants an extra 10% combat strength to ALL units and allows for the production of Robot Infantry).</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste has finally captured Abeche, but Mali is putting up stiff resistance in the Sahel… what they need is a buffer state, and so Xanana Gusmao decides to revive the greatest buffer state of all: Chad! The odds of their survival are looking pretty slim, surrounded by Malian troops on all sides, but they’ll certainly buy Timor some time.</p>"

  scene_title: "No Maori"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>At the same time, Timor also decides to handle the Inca advance by reviving another long-dead civilization: the Maori!</p><p></p><p>…They then proceed to kill the Maori again instantly, presumably as payback for their failures against the Wiradjuri so many years ago. I… suppose this calls for a eulogy.</p><p></p><p>It’s always fun to see fan favorites from days past revived for one more brief cameo, but the Maori seem to have been subjected to a fate even more cruel than if they had never been revived to begin with. The Maori went from dead to alive to dead again so quickly that a sidebar notification is the only evidence that they were ever revived at all. If nothing else, I suppose they at least now hold the record for shortest amount of time spent on the cylinder in one sitting. F.</p>"

  scene_title: "Close Taizz"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>That Dark Age doesn’t seem to be slowing Yemen down one bit, because they’ve just retaken Taizz from Turkey! Much like their capture of Ghazni, the Turkish forces in the area will probably undo this before long, but it’s still an excellent testament to the stubbornness of the Yemeni people. It’s not like Yemen is all that close to running out of units, either - they can keep the fight going for quite some time if they want to.</p>"

  scene_title: "Againistan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Afghanistan has pushed back slightly in Southeast Asia, retaking Maw Hteik from the Timorese clutches, but they’ve lost both Shwe Yin See and Wanchanshu in the process. Timor-Leste still holds a decisive advantage on this front. Htin Par Keng looks like the red-and-gold army’s next target, but with a Nexus and several aircraft guarding the city, it seems like things may get trickier for Timor-Leste from here on out.</p>"

  scene_title: "Last Cry of the Jungle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>The run-down Kayapo military manages one final counter-offensive with their few remaining units, retaking both Kremoro and Gorotire in the process. It’s certainly impressive, but with Inca units already in position to flip the cities right back, it seems as though this will end up an ultimately fruitless gesture.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Return"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>There is chaos in the war room of Dili. Despite the revival of several buffer states, Timor-Leste is still struggling to fend off their rivals in Africa. Could it be true that reviving civs is completely pointless and only serves to waste a captured city? No, of course not. The Timorese simply aren’t reviving the right civs. But… can they truly risk the consequences of bringing back a monster? Xanana Gusmao, visibly afraid, nonetheless decides that they must. He got this far by risking it all, and he’s not going to give up now. He steels himself, and then pushes the button he hoped never to press.</p><p></p><p>The siren sounds.</p><p></p><p>The cylinder trembles.</p><p></p><p>Kilwa has returned.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Tiger Sleeps Tonight"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode40-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Kilwa may live, Bengal certainly does not. The Timorese see immediate success as a result of their decision, not only capturing Patna, but also Darbhanga, finally eliminating Bengal from the game.</p><p></p><p>Bengal was a civilization with a lot of promise, expanding quickly and crippling Pandya early on. However, as the game continued, Bengal eventually just… stopped. They tried and failed to break down the walls of Kokang to no avail, and they let Afghanistan seize the bulk of Pandya lands, denying them any easy conquests and trapping them between two major powers. Nonetheless, Bengal remained a threatening military force, always maintaining a solid unit carpet but never managing to use it on anything aside from a brief and inconclusive war with Indonesia and a mercy-killing of the mighty Cambodia. When Total War came around,Bengal was expected to be a tough but ultimately irrelevant speed bump for the likes of Afghanistan or Kokang, or perhaps eventually Timor-Leste or Turkey. Instead, Bengal decided to punctuate their life of stagnation with a truly brilliant death. As their neighbors exhausted themselves fighting one another, Bengal used their stockpiled military to blitz through the empty Afghan lands and even briefly push Timor-Leste back through Southeast Asia. Their master plan was stunning, but sadly, the Bengali forces simply lacked the Production to keep their war machine running. As the Bengali reserves dried up, their neighbors (particularly Afghanistan) kicked their militaries into high gear, reversing the tiger’s gains and ultimately leaving them to die at the hands of Timor-Leste. Their life may not have always been all that exciting, but you can’t say they didn’t try. F.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Unfortunately for the mighty Kilwa, their luck has already run out. Though they may have outlasted Bengal, the Yemeni forces in the area have quickly retaken Kilwa Kisiwani, eliminating Kilwa for the second time.</p><p></p><p>After Kilwa’s hard-fought but ultimately fruitless final struggle against Angola and Yemen, many foolishly believed that they had seen the last of this plucky little civ. However, the machinations of fellow CBR icon Timor-Leste led to their miraculous return, and in their own capital, no less. With the capture of Kilwa Kisiwani from Yemen, the Timorese elected to return the once-great city to its original owners, and give these (un)living legends a chance at revenge. Unfortunately, however, the Yemeni military proved to be too strong for the fledgeling Second Kilwa Empire, and Ali ibn al-Hassan was forced to watch as his once-mighty nation was snuffed out by their ancient rivals in Yemen for the second time.

  narration: "<p>The Turkish-Afghan front continues to stagnate, with Asir holding steady at around half health and Afghan soldiers still struggling to damage Aral. Konya is surrounded, too, but the city hasn’t taken any damage yet. On the other hand, though, the former Massagetae capital of Jaxartes appears to have been knocked into the red by a cheeky Afghan vanguard. The Turks hold steady here for now, but could Afghanistan have a better shot at making gains here than expected</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brandenburg finally retakes the Hague after a drawn-out siege, meaning that the two remaining European civs now own each other’s capitals. The city of Lundenburh along the Baltic Sea coast appears to have been captured as well, meaning that Brandenburg now has three footholds on western/central Europe. In fact, looking at Oveido, they may have a fourth soon. As if the loss of their capital isn’t bad enough, the Anglo-Dutch aren’t even trying to retake it - a Turkish military force has taken Potsdam and is now threatening Konigsberg and perhaps even Berlin, forcing the few remaining Anglo-Dutch troops to rush to defend their newfound gains.</p>"

This time, it’s Chad, who have finally fallen to the Malian advance.</p><p></p><p>Chad’s return to the cylinder was more eventful than most. Brought back by Timor-Leste in the midst of an active war zone, the significant Malian military presence in the region all but guaranteed that this former fan favorite wouldn’t last a single turn. And yet… they did! Against all odds, despite being surrounded by hostile Power Armor Infantry, the city of Abeche held out for at least two full turns, acting as a minor step towards Chad earning back their once-glowing reputation. But alas, all good things must come to an end, and Mali finally took the city back under their control, albeit at a heavy cost to their manpower in the region. Well played, Chad. F.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Arapaho have been struggling to break into South America thus far, but this latest push shows that they’re certainly not done trying. Guatemala City, Olinda, and Qalla Q’asa have all been seized by the advancing Arapaho forces, and the ascendant North American power now seems to have an iron grip on Panama. The Inca are preoccupied with uniting their own continent; could this push be the one that finally lets the Arapaho cement a foothold in their American rival’s front yard?</p>"

  narration: "<p>While the assault on Central America progresses, the Arapaho have also dedicated a portion of their fleet to strike at the remains of the Kayapo. This is a brilliant plan in theory, but in practice, a lack of melee units means that the only thing Pretty Nose is accomplishing is softening the Kayapo up for the Inca forces. Not that their help is particularly needed in that department, mind you - Gorotire, Kokraimoro, and even Kremoro, are now solidly in the hands of the Inca, and it seems like only a matter of time before the Kayapo are kicked off of mainland South America entirely.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Afghanistan appears to have briefly captured Izhma from Avi Mota, but here we see that they’ve since retaken it, and devastated the invading Afghan forces, to boot. This means that, amazingly, Avi Mota lives on! With the Afghans mostly neutralized, the Biotrooper swarm now returns to conquest, striking at both Guangzhou and the isolated Han fortress of Samagaltay. That said, splitting one’s forces is an infamously bad strategy… Avi Mota’s hubris could lead to their downfall, here.</p>"

However, they’ve forgotten to account for one crucial detail: Timor-Leste can always just capture the cities again.</p><p></p><p>That’s right, fools, Kilwa is back again! Africa’s funniest civ has risen from the grave once more as Timor-Leste recaptures Kilwa Kisiwani and liberates the city, and this time, there aren’t nearly as many Yemeni units around.

How innocent we were to underestimate their power. Kilwa’s third coming, again at the behest of Timor-Leste, was a truly marvelous sight to behold. As if to spite their murderers, the purple paragons once again rose from their grave, taking up residence in their immortal capital to spit in the face of the once-proud empire of Yemen. In fact, this time the Timorese had taken extra precautions to ensure their safety, clearing the area of Yemeni forces so that the abominable seed they had planted could take root and eventually devour their old rivals whole. Yes, the plan was perfect, and Kilwa would surely secure themselves a permanent place on the cylinder once more.</p><p></p><p>But woe! A lone Automaton had managed to escape the notice of the Timorese, and it struck at Ali ibn al-Hassan as soon as he stepped foot back into his home. Tragically, the triumphant reign of the Third Kilwa Empire was cut short, and their wise and noble ruler was whisked back to the submarine once more by their cruelest of enemies.

Timor-Leste has taken the city of Kilwa Kisiwani for themselves, eliminating Kilwa for the third time this episode.</p><p></p><p>The saga of Kilwa has been a wild one, a tragedy in three acts. Their first revival established the situation - Timor-Leste required a diplomatic bonus and a buffer state against Yemen, and Kilwa fulfilled that need. This period also established the villain of our tale: Yemen, who had been the one to originally slay Kilwa. We saw the power of Kilwa and their magical capabilities, outlasting Bengal, but before long they fell back into the hands of Yemen.</p><p></p><p>The second revival of Kilwa demonstrated the development of this established formula: again Kilwa was raised by Timor-Leste in the face of Yemen, but this time the cruel Yemeni forces were ready for their return, ending their existence even more quickly. In this, the desperate fury of Yemen was evident, struggling to conceal and repress the cruel actions of their past in order to convince themselves that their fight remained just. And indeed, it seemed as though the end of Kilwa was finally at hand with their third death.</p><p></p><p>However, Kilwa returned once more, defying all expectations and cementing themselves as a true legend. It was this third revival that finally forced Yemen to confront the error of their ways and accept the consequences of their actions. Haunted by this eternal specter, Yemen finally relented and agreed to peace with their old enemies in Kilwa (however futile it may have been in Total War). Thus, Yemen’s character arc was complete, and Kilwa had finally achieved closure. However, poor Kilwa’s happy ending was not to be. Timor-Leste, the seemingly benevolent overlord that had returned Kilwa from the grave, suddenly turned on their ally, slaying them where they stood for daring to reconcile with their ancient enemy. A truly heartbreaking betrayal, but a captivating ending for this masterpiece of a tale that has played out in Kilwa Kisiwani. That is, unless Yemen were to retake the city and force Timor-Leste to flip it again, of course. Then maybe, just maybe, we could see Kilwa once more. Until then, though, F.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait until next episode to see the continuation of Avi Mota’s rampage, because we’re ending this episode with a shot of a minor Mohave L. The Pacific island city of Qapotaq-Iv’auve, not far from the new Mohave capital of Avi Hamoka, has fallen to a lone Timorese Biotrooper. There aren’t many units out here, and Timor-Leste doesn’t seem likely to make any further gains in this region any time soon, but it’s still a fairly unsettling sign of things to come if the Mohave don’t step up their defenses around these islands. Inca Hawaii is also looking quite terrifying.</p><p></p><p>That’s all for tonight’s episode! Thank you for reading, and be sure to tune in next time as Total War continues to shift the balance of power throughout the cylinder. Until then, though, I’ve been u/daXfactorz or NopeCopter, and thanks for reading. (Oh, and if you look at the minimap, you’ll notice that Great Ming is in fact still alive. Have fun, Power Rankers!)</p>"
