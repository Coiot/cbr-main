      narration: "<p>Hello, Denizens of the Sub! Welcome to the 21st episode of CBRX Season 3. I am Nirosat, your resident lurker turned narrator for this week’s slides. I do not play much Civilization, but I have followed the CBR for the past 8 years. It has a special place for me as it indulges my love of history and my love of imaginary “what if” timelines. This is my first narration, which came about due to an inebriated signup and eventually a coin flip game…don’t ask. </p><p></p><p>Anyways, let’s get into the episode. I’m sure you are all as excited as I am to see how our beloved factions surprise and disappoint us. </p>"

      narration: "<p>No, I don’t even like Vermont. Or at least I didn’t. I guess my feelings are very mixed on Vermont now. It’s kinda like that one stranger you meet on a team building exercise or at summer camp and you become buds with them during that trip. But only from that trip. Afterwards you don’t really talk to them and you wonder if you were actually friends or just friends via circumstance. That’s me and Vermont now. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We begin this week's episode with a shot of the British (or maybe Irish?) Isles where America has managed to capture Tralee. In classic battle royale fashion, they celebrate by setting the city ablaze. Michael Collins rallies troops around Dublin for the inevitable push to retake the city. </p><p></p><p>Up north, the Irish have made zero progress on their siege of Baltimore with the situation looking nearly identical to when we last saw it.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Burgos drops to half health as Mali's invasion fleet swarms the city. A few Castile vessels attempt to defend the city, but Isabella appears to be holding the majority of the army back to defend the mainland. I expect this city’s colors to change the next time we see it. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the heart of Europe, Brandenberg laments that there are virtually no more locations to settle on the map. The kingdom stagnates and falls into a dark age.</p>"

      narration: "<p>A catapult plinks away at Machu walls as Incan defenders watch bemused from the battlements. They wonder how such a technologically backwards army could hope to achieve anything. The Inca are so indifferent to the attacks that Sao Salvador has but a few trebuchets to defend the city. </p><p></p><p>While the garrison mocks the technology of their attackers, rumors begin to trickle down from the Amazon. Travelers whisper of a civilization hidden deep within the jungle with technology beyond comprehension. A land with massive palaces, towers that touch the clouds, and cities with tens of millions of inhabitants. It’s said to be a paradise with no hunger, no war, and instead embraces the beauty of art and music.</p><p>—</p><p>Kayapo has entered the Modern Era. Absolutely wild. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Inca invasion of the Wiradjuri continues as the former begins to eye mainland Australia. A handful of ships advance to pepper the coast while a larger force assembles near Maiyingu Marragu and the newly established settlement of Inti Watana. Said force includes the Chaska Chuqui, a Longsword replacement that receives +1 movement and requires no iron. What’s more interesting, though, is that they also receive additional combat strength the farther they are from the capital. Considering the location of this front, that might be a significant difference. </p>"

      narration: "<p>A flurry of cannon fire rains down on the Ainu coast as the Mali begin their assault on Usukeshi. Considering this is a fairly defensible city, and Mali isn't exactly a military powerhouse, this siege could continue for a very long time. </p><p>—</p><p>I also would like to point out that North Korea is a populist republic. </p>"

      narration: "<p>What didn’t last a long time was Burgos. Mali has captured the city and it doesn’t look like Castile is even going to try and get it back. Mali has been making decent moves recently as they have crawled up the West African coast. We will see if they can maintain momentum into the Spanish Peninsula or if the ball stops here. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Mohave continue to push Cree positions in the Pacific Northwest with attacks on Bigstone and Nisicha Wayasihk.. The Cree respond with a counter-attack on recently captured Wabasca. The rough terrain could turn this into another bloodbath.</p><p>—</p><p>Cree artist Hieronymus hikes through the Cascades bearing witness to the bloodshed.

I repeat, Egypt has made peace with Vermont.</p><p></p><p>Equally as impactful is the ongoing Afghanistan Kokang war.   We can see the former’s forces just managing to affect Htin Par Keng’s health bar.

      narration: "<p>And with a swift counter, Ireland manages to retake Tralee and douse the flames before the city turns to soot. The remaining American units are scattered. So I don’t think it is likely to swap back. Baltimore is currently in the black and all that is needed is a melee unit for the city to turn green. </p>"

      scene_title: "The Tide Turns"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode21-scene15.jpg
      narration: "<p>Lithuania’s attack continued to stall against Vladimir long enough that the latter was able to make a deal with the Permians. Now with support from the big bear on the north flank, Vladimir forces cross into Lithuanian lands along the relatively undefended southern border. </p><p></p><p>Most of Lithuania’s military remains on the northern front near T’ver. Vladimir composite bowmen assemble to defend the city, and Permian troops nearby are in position to assist in distracting the assault. To make matters worse, Lithuania is in the midst of a Dark Age. Perhaps the brutal war dragging on, or the change in circumstance has caused disillusionment in the populace. </p><p>—</p><p>Hans Holbein the Younger was a German-Swiss painter known for portraits. He learned from his father of the same name (the elder) and is the man behind the work “The Ambassadors”. Lithuania may need some ambassadors now if they want to make peace before their fortunes turn south. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode21-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>Mali has a swarm of units around Split and has reduced the city to zero health. Since the Mali UU, the Ton-Tigi, is a knight replacement with range, it seems they are unable to capture the city themselves. Instead, they opt to break down the defenders with vicious slander to coax out a surrender. </p><p></p><p>Upset at Castile’s defensive choices, Carlos III has left his home in Spain in the hopes his strategic prowess could be put to use. </p><p>—</p><p>I believe the Carlos III represented here is the King of Spain (aka Charles III in anglicized form) who conducted conquests of Naples and Sicily.</p>"

      narration: "<p>All is quiet between the Gokturks and Cree as the former seems happy enough with taking just Tzatsisnukomi. In a project to solidify their northern holdings, they construct a series of island forts around Dzawadi.</p><p></p><p>Down South the Mori attack on Usukeshi has gone nowhere since we last saw it and across the Pacific the Cree have fended off the Mohave push on Bigstone.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode21-scene19.jpg
      narration: "<p>Lithuania and Vladimir both press forward, damaging T’ver and Siauliai respectively as the front seems to pinwheel around. Lithuania seems better equipped for a siege, but must contend with defending troops as well as the Permian troops lurking off screen. Meanwhile the south is devoid of military, but Vladimir lacks siege equipment.</p><p></p><p>To assist in taking advantage of the opening, Luis Aves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias (what a name) is directed to the front. </p><p>—</p><p>In our timeline he was a Brazilian field marshall and politician known for his loyalty.

I do not see much else happening in this war.</p><p></p><p>Upset they lost a city in such a pointless conflict, America makes peace with Botswana, ending a different war that also didn’t really matter.</p>"

      narration: "<p>In Kremoro, dusk besets the city. The shadows of the skyscrapers mirror the workers as they stretch after a hard day’s work. One by one, lights flicker on as the city glows, defiant of the setting of the sun. Some residents fret about the evening activities, to perambulate the city parks, relish a cocktail at that new high end bar, or perhaps a night at the theater. Ever more choices present themselves as the newest spectacles line the streets of cities alight in the darkness.</p><p>—</p><p>The Kayapo completes Broadway, which, while worthless in a domination game, is the first modern age wonder on the cylinder. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Not content with just Castile, Mali bombards Christianshab from the sea. I did not realize these two were at war, and based on the defense I don’t think Greenland was either. If the city is captured, I see it staying in Mali’s hands. </p><p></p><p>A significant American force accumulates in the Atlantic for another attempt to gain ground in Ireland. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Perhaps neglecting Sao Salvador was not the best idea in hindsight. If you asked me at the last part what I thought of Rio de la Plata war on Inca, I would have given the “at least they tried” award. However, if Inca doesn’t even try to defend, then the Rioplatense has a shot. </p><p></p><p>Also, despite being passive militarily, Kayapo has an adequate force when compared to their neighbors. </p>"

Meanwhile Gabriela Silang is assigned to defend T’ver, which looks about the same as before. Permian soldiers continue to support from a distance, much to the annoyance of the T’ver defenders.

      narration: "<p>Supplies arrived yesterday in the late afternoon, and while the sailors stayed overnight, they left at first dawn. I couldn’t blame them. All visitors to Mukalla decide against staying after one night in the cold. They joke about how they couldn’t stand the heat at home before they came here and how Mukalla changed their mind. I don’t really see how that makes much sense. How could heat possibly be a bad thing? Whenever I ask that, they call me Walad Jalid, Ice Boy. </p><p></p><p>I watch the ship as it leaves, a small thing in the distance. Its sails flutter and flicker as they catch the light, like the glint of snow before melting in the distance. Eventually another ship will come, carrying more tales of a land with plains of sand instead of snow. A place where so much more seems to happen than this small village on the edge of the world. </p><p>—</p><p>For real though, who decides to live here?</p>"

      narration: "<p>Cambodia joins the war against Pandya. They cannot get there, but perhaps they will cheer very loudly. </p><p></p><p>What’s more interesting is the view of Indonesia. It’s a bit misshapen and stringy, but it’s packed with units. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Here we get a close look at the Timor-Leste capital and it is massive. In fact, it is the largest city on the cylinder outside of Kayapo borders. To protect the jewel of their nation, Timor-Leste builds Fasil Ghebbi, a wonder that provides +9 defense in the city it is built and a 33% combat bonus to any units in a two tile radius. Considering the distance between their capital and Indonesia, it may actually make a difference if the two clash.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Agent S. takes the middle table. One would think a spy would sit at the edge or a corner, but being in the midst of everything allows you to hear so much more. It’s dusk, and laborers begin to filter in after a day's hard work. Lanterns are lit, drinks are poured, lips unsealed. </p><p>A couple things perk the spy’s interest. Sentiment against Kokang seems to be falling. Agent S assumes this is due to the territorial acquisition toward Nar Le, a decent compromise as opposed to war as far as he is concerned. Another is word of an uprising in Permian land just to the west. Apparently some are upset about the morality of some wartime decisions that came to light regarding alliances.</p><p></p><p>But the real kicker was the last one. Mentions that Tuva should make a move against the Permains. Agent S already knew the territory was devoid of any military. If Tuva acted on this the results would be…unimaginable. </p><p>—</p><p>In what might be the spiciest intel drop we’ve gotten yet in the CBRX3, Tuvo is plotting against the Permians. This could be nothing, but it's a massive note to end on if it has any merit.</p><p>—</p><p>Anyways, thank you so much for joining me in exploring the events of the cylinder this week. I hope you were as entertained reading it as I was writing it. </p><p>-Nirosat</p>"
