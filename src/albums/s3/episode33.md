      narration: "<p>Hey. Welcome back to Civ Battle Royale. I’m ThyReformer, and I’m a narrator today. Last episode saw Turkey dismantle another neighbor, the deaths of many rumps, and Arapaho continuing to cement their power in North America. And can’t forget about the new neighbors we have down in Antarctica. Those Iberians sure have a strange propensity towards madness, and this stunt will be hard to beat. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Moving on, I’m gonna go on record saying Orange’s comic this week is the best OC this season. Orange has been consistently making great countryball comics, but this 14-page special edition is simply amazing. </p>"

      narration: "<p>As always, my utmost respect towards those who can keep up the map work. This one is Nathanmasse’s, and the tile-accurate style is probably my favorite. Expect some of these borders to shift this episode, perhaps radically…</p>"

      narration: "<p>That deviation value should tell you all you need to know about what’s happening behind the scenes. The debate over Castile’s rank - and if they even deserve one - will surely continue to live on.</p>"

      narration: "<p>And we’re into action. This region of the world still has rumps to clean up, and Bengal, ever the rivals of Kokang, decide that being able to kill Cambodia would be a great way to humiliate their worst rivals. The Cambodian city-state has proven itself to be a tough nut to crack, and Bengal’s approach is far worse than Kokang’s, but maybe the tech difference is finally big enough to make a difference? </p>"

      narration: "<p>With the Angolan military concentrated on breaking through Kilwa’s defenses, the recently conquered Chadian territories are largely ungarrisoned. That hasn’t stopped Angola from placing some citadels towards Uganda, likely in preparation for an easier invasion once they’re done with Kilwa. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene08.jpg
      narration: "<p>Lithuania hangs on to a few original cities in the frigid north, and may have just enough luck here to keep a city or two. The Turkish borders stretching northward mean that Brandenburg will struggle to advance past Nesvyzius, while Tuva is kept at bay by the Lithuanian submarine fleet. Either way, an untenable position, and a sad state for a civ that looked quite healthy a while ago. </p>"

      narration: "<p>With the excuse of the Norman-Ugandan war, we look at the Angolan-occupied Chad another time. I’ll point out that Chad could deal some damage with a quick blitz, but with a serious production disadvantage, would likely end up falling back all the way to Fada. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene10.jpg
      narration: "<p>As one would expect, the hellish terrain between Angola and Kilwa means that progress is slow, if there is any progress at all. I would predict Kuito to be decisively Angolan by the end of the war, but considering Kilwa’s navy, the coastal cities will end up being flipfests. If Angola even makes it that far, that is.</p>"

      narration: "<p>A city was burnt to the ground here last time, as you may recall. Kokang is taking advantage of the Resettlement tenet to, well, resettle the island with more starting population. Not the worst strategy ever. Avoids those pesky foreign dissidents, too.</p>"

      narration: "<p>One civ died here last episode and another was forced into retirement, and the region is still ugly as sin. It’s like an eldritch horror in how it makes me want to tear my eyes out of their sockets. REALLY hoping Normans do some more clean-up here instead of dreaming up campaigns against Uganda. </p>"

      narration: "<p>A combined Muiscan-Incan offensive against Kayapo would certainly devastate the massive population centers and peaceful nature preserves of the Green Terror of the Amazon. Whether the attackers could hold onto territory gained is another thing, but Kayapo is not known for building a large army. </p><p></p><p>Ahmes was an ancient Egyptian scribe in our timeline. Perhaps he is cataloging and chronicling the ecological benefits of Kayapo’s preservation policies.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene15.jpg
      narration: "<p>In North America, Cree and Arapaho continue their grueling deathmatch, which, considering the statistical advantage Arapaho has, should not be nearly this close of a fight. The Cree fighting spirit is admirable, comparable perhaps to that of the Yugoslavs, even as they fight in the ruins of their once-great capital. </p><p></p><p>Cree maintains a sizable fleet in the Pacific, likely in fear of an opportunistic attack from Mohave.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>I spoke too soon. Turkey has granted open borders to Brandenburg, and on the other side a Tuvan tank has reached the gates of Seinai. Merely a matter of time now before Lithuania is banished to Iberia, that land of the deranged…a perilous suggestion. </p>"
    - scene_number: 17
      scene_title: "Against the odds…!"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene17.jpg
      narration: "<p>Off-screen, Tuva captures Seinai indeed, and Brandenburg takes Svencionys…but do my eyes deceive me?! It seems that Lithuania managed to retake Nesvyzius, and THEN succeeded in negotiating peace with Brandenburg. A remarkable feat. Assuming Lithuania’s submarine fleet is intact, Tuva will struggle to take the last Lithuanian arctic city. Perhaps Lithuania will avoid the dark fate of banishment to Iberia after all.</p>"

      scene_title: "One size fits all"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene18.jpg
      narration: "<p>Ah, paratroopers, the skeleton key to open any lock. Now if only the AI used some of that air superiority to kill Cambodian units, the approach would be far simpler. I would absolutely bet on a Cambodian death at this point though.</p>"

      scene_title: "A fate worse than death"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene19.jpg
      narration: "<p>That’s what I get for praising them. Though Nesvyzius was in minimal danger, Lithuania simply gives the city away in the peace deal with Tuva. Lithuania is fully, inexorably, an Iberian city-state now. </p>"

      scene_title: "It belongs in a museum"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene21.jpg
      narration: "<p>That didn’t take long. The city may flip, but Bengal humiliates Kokang with ease, putting countless Cambodian musicians out of work. Or maybe they were already unemployed. </p><p></p><p>Cambodia is eliminated in 32nd place. Cambodia was one of those civs that had a rough time expanding at all. Forward-settled by pretty much every neighbor from the get-go - even the Philippines made landfall in South East Asia just to spite Cambodia - they never got a real chance. After being reduced to a city-state, they fought an admirable defense against Kokang for a few hundred turns, and eventually earned their right to be Kokang’s pet city-state. Of course, that was mostly just Kokang trying to hide the embarrassment of the failure. But the world kept on moving forward while Cambodia remained stuck in the Renaissance, a living artifact of the past, until the tech difference was simply too great, and Bengal squashed them like a bug.

      narration: "<p>Ah! The war I expected is here! For most of history, Inca hadn’t maintained a sizable military in their homeland, so when they did start doing so, you knew something was up. Still, this will not be easy, and I don’t know where the Incan air force is lounging, either. Hopefully not on the other side of their vast empire.

      narration: "<p>First blood is dealt down here, though, and this may very well be the most active theater of the war, considering the Incan naval strength in the Pacific. Funny enough, here is also a sizable portion of the Incan airforce, for some reason. Let’s hope it gets shuffled to a better position.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode33-scene25.jpg
      narration: "<p>Turkey does not employ a lot of land forces, instead relying on a dominant airforce and an overabundance of nuclear weapons to maintain their sprawling empire. Considering the overall tiny amount of regular land units Turkey has, the deployment of even this many troops near the Norman border could hint at war in the near future.</p>"

      narration: "<p>A look at Greenland, who are probably safe from attacks from North America for a while now, considering America was crippled and Arapaho doesn’t have enough of a presence here yet. But still, they must look eastward with fear. The Brandenburger fleet fills the entire North Sea, and spills into the Atlantic. These numbers are sufficient to bring terror to most civs on the Atlantic, but so far Brandenburg has not seen the need to use this power.</p>"

And just in time as well, as Kayapo makes the first move here, beelining for Quito. Don’t let the puny size of the offensive fool you: in the age of the airplane, even one of these special forces is plenty enough to flip the city. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Meanwhile in the north, Arapaho moves forward, slowly but surely. The frontline washes over the crumbling Cree capital, and even the indomitable Cree fighting spirit will struggle to retake the city. Still, the war isn’t getting any easier for Arapaho, and every turn spent struggling is another turn that might lead Mohave to take advantage of the defenseless southern Arapaho.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Well, we did expect it. A special Mohave operation finally takes out the North Korean mountain fortress, and North Korea is eliminated in 31st place. </p><p></p><p>North Korea likewise played an unimpressive game, but at least not as unimpressive as Cambodia. Small consolation, though. North Korea spent most of the game settling little and fighting a lot, particularly against Mori. Eventually, the pitiful Korean civ had the last of their hopes and dreams crushed by Han, and North Korea was imprisoned in the very city they fought Mori for, over and over…Life’s cruelties have a way of being ironic. Death in the hands of Mohave was but an inevitability. F.</p>"

Even Kremero itself - the beating heart of the Kayapo Empire, with a population of 164,931,000, equivalent to the entire real life nation of Nigeria - is completely vulnerable.

Can you spot the difference? On slide 38, there was a very populous city here bearing the name of Saungkang. Now there is an empty gap.</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Due to the lack of fallout, the leading theory is that Mohave used non-nuclear missiles to wipe out the city. To think that Irataba ordered a Kokang city annihilated, just to get the peace deal he desired - and he did not even use it to get cities out of Kokang, he merely wanted to get out of the war to move his focus elsewhere. Concerning, to say the least. </p>"

If Inca are not careful, they may lose the nine planes sitting in the city, which would be a serious blow, even if Kayapo has only one measly plane in the area.

Catamarca falls to a small squadron of ships, Tucuman is overwhelmed by the Incan land forces, but at least the defense of Concepción rages on, giving hope to the rest of Kayapo.
