  narration: "<p>Hi everybody, My name is U/QuantumBotany, long time lurker, CBR enjoyer, and author of one (1) piece of OC published last week, and I will be your narrator and guide for this week's episode. Since the rate of conquest has slowed in the late game, most of the narration in this episode will be based on my personal headcanon. Thus, please feel free to disagree, discuss, or disregard my first attempts at creative writing in the comments. I am INSANELY excited to share this episode with you all, so lets get into it!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have a piece of OC from the lovely and talented u/ExplosiveWatermelon on Reddit. In this thought-provoking piece, William III, the leader of the Anglo-Dutch, rides a dolphin over the endless and bountiful sea. I’ve always wondered how one would ride a marine animal, given that I cannot breathe underwater, but it seems that William III has it figured out. Props to him!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have another installment of the best weekly comic series, by none other than the magnanimous U/Orangechrisy. The short Avi Motan empire is one of the most memorable, yet confusing parts of the CBRX3, and indeed the CBR as a whole. The offshoot city state, which at one point even controlled a capital, is unbelievable, even to Irataba himself.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Timor Leste is by and large, the biggest upset in the history of the CBR, as well as my favorite. Even in the second stage of total war they maintain the #2 spot. Nobody expected anything of them, but they are providing a good show for the bloodthirsty crowd on the sub.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Battle of Hamhung, Pt1"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We will start this week's album with an image of the recently re-established Mohave occupation of the North Korean peninsula. Occupation authorities here have a tough job. The once-great Mohave empire has seen a steep decline since the beginning of the first wave of Total War. Their homeland in California, as well as their vice-princedom of Mexico, languish under Arapaho occupation. The long-lost Mohave colony Avi Mota is now only the most recent of Ahmad Shah Durrani’s imperial conquests. The only territories that remain nominally as a part of the ancient Princedom are islands in the Pacific. Korean occupation authorities watch nervously as Mohave Biotroopers attack the walls of Hamhung. There aren’t many territories left for them to lose.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over in the Horn of Africa, the Citizens of Mbarara murmur cautiously in their bunkers. The bombings stopped. In fact, not a single bomb has been heard for over a day. “It doesn’t matter why! We need food, We need water, we need medicine, and I’m going out there to find it.” exclaimed the dark-haired man. His breath stank of hashish, sweat, tobacco, and vomit.  “I can’t do it alone though. I beg, those here who are fit to make a journey, please come with me. The bombs might kill us, but starvation and submission surely will.” Several greasy, tired faces peered at him, then rose. Several more followed, and following them was a flood of people, from all walks of life, all with one goal: Find help for the city of Mbarara. Even as the first caravan of people reached the irradiated Ugandan highlands, people still poured out of the bunkers in a single file. They were going to live, one way or another. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chaos reigns in the Mohave high command. It was a trap. When biotroopers entered the walled city of Hamhung, they found little resistance. Only once a forward base, with a mustered force of over 300,000 troops, along with the nearly 4 million inhabitants of the city, did the nuclear strike come in. 15 “Bengali” class nuclear ICBMs slammed into the city and its surrounding areas, with a flash of light that was seen all the way from Pengcheng. 85% of Mohave assets, along with an estimated 55% of the city’s population, were eliminated. An Afghan communiqué intercepted by Babylonian agents justified the action as such: “Not only was any Mohave offensive momentum decisively crushed, but our future lands in Manchuria will be depopulated of undesirables, vastly easing our Afghan resettlement program in the region.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Great Turkish Islamic Federation"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Far from the frontlines, the Imamates of Balkhash, Massagettae, Permia, and Western Tuva recover from Turkey’s conquest of the region. Unlike many of the other superstates that exist on the cylinder, The Great Turkish Islamic Federation treats the citizens of its conquered territories with a certain amount of respect. Regional governments, called Imamates, operate in the local language in addition to Turkish, manage local affairs without significant interference, and can hire their own officials. One point that is non-negotiable for the Great Sheikh Ataturk in Ankara, however, is religion. Islam is strictly enforced as the only state religion, and other religions, prevalent mostly in Turkey’s Siberian territories, are De Facto banned. This, however, does little to stop citizens from worshipping in secret. Just don’t tell anybody ok? ;)</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Mohave High Command continues to surprise, as biotroopers equipped with aquatic adaptations such as gills located on their armpits, and webbed feet, descend upon the Afghan-occupied city of Lingqiu. Afghan authorities are shocked to see a counterattack so soon after the Hamhung strike, but mount a defense with local resources nonetheless. Disturbingly, the Biotroopers clambering onto the docks seem, according to genetic analysis, to have formerly been North Korean civilians, modified and fitted with control implants by Mohave military bioengineers.</p><p>Another intercepted Afghan High command Communique: “Despite the unexpectedness of today's attack, the implications of genetic analyses are good news: The Mohave are running out of bodies. Thankfully, we are nowhere close to running out of shells, nuclear warheads, or armor.”</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>As trade caravans continue to pour out of Mbarara, Piet Mondrian (OTL a Dutch painter and art theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest abstract artists of the 20th century.) ponders his position in the current conflict. Originally an Anglo-Dutch citizen, he fled the destruction of the Irish Isles all the way around the Cape to Yemeni Somalia. He thought he had escaped war, but in reality, he had escaped only one. Looking over the bomb-cratered skyline of the city, he sighed. “How absolutely miserable,” he thought, as he lightly laid another brushstroke on his canvas.</p>"

  scene_title: "Total War Arrives Again"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Hague experienced a rude awakening last night. An air raid siren filled the air of the hot summer night. Many people wondered “Are the Burgers attacking again?” Others thought it was perhaps the infamous Turkish menace, coming to finish them off. A few citizens even considered the possibility of a Malian strike in the South. Few considered, perhaps despite historical precedent, that an external influence, far beyond their understanding, had decided that today was the day the world went to war. </p><p></p><p>And thus, the second round of total war begins.</p>"

  scene_title: "War on the Sea"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>A fleet of highly advanced Timorese ships creeps up the Ryukyuan island chain. They aim to capture the Mohave settlement of Mant Hkar. The Timorese navy is widely known to be the finest in the world, second only to perhaps the Inca (a classic argument at bars around the cylinder. The winner of this argument tends to be the biggest guy at the bar you happen to be in, weirdly enough). Despite being confined to several disparate island territories, Mohave possesses very few operable naval vessels, most of which are currently staving off the Inca in Hawaii. This is bad news for the Mohave, who are significantly outmatched in materiel in the region.</p>"

  scene_title: "Mexican Standoff"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Thundering steps can be heard in the verdant, yet war-torn valleys of what used to be the Mohave Vice-Princedom of Mexico. These lands, once among the most productive and prosperous regions of the cylinder, have been stripped of their resources and thoroughly plundered by the forces of the Arapaho League.The Inca, having recently gained a foothold in the region by means of their signature naval blitzkrieg tactics, have struggled to restore the destroyed infrastructure on their side of the border. The Arapaho, with their brobdingnagian military-industrial complex, have had no such issues, and are mustering a massive invasion force to attempt to remove the Incan foothold in the region.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Brandenburg National Reclamation front, having recently overthrown the half of the prior government that made it out of Berlin, has begun its invasion of the so-called Imamate of Oranienburg. Spearheading this frontal assault is a massive wave of Power Armor Infantry, a fixture piece of Atlantic militaries. Due to limited manpower and agricultural resources, and abundant mineral resources, Power Armor is much preferred over biotroopers in Brandenburg, the Anglo-Dutch Empire, and Mali. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Rangpur, historically a Bengali city, fell under Timor’s red curtain in the last phase of Total War. Little news gets in, or out. The trickle of news coming out of Rangpur as of recent, however, has indicated an Afghan invasion force has reached the island city. Nobody knows what will happen next. </p>"

  scene_title: "The North Sea Rebellion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Since the collapse of the Berlin government, civilian law enforcement has sharply declined in presence, especially in the outlying islands of the North Sea. With most land forces tied down in the Scandinavian front, many people who would otherwise not rebel for fear of government violence, are now emboldened. The citizens of the islands of Orkney and the Faroes, using smuggled military bioengineering equipment (decommissioned by the new government), have unleashed chimeras on local law enforcement.There are a few land units that can respond, but in all likelihood, this will be dealt with in the same way the Brandenburg deal with most problems: unrestricted offshore bombardment by the navy.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Crawler"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode43-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Manchuria burns. Forces from 4 different powers make battle here. Most soldiers, if indeed they are soldiers and not bioengineered monsters or robots, do not know who they are fighting before they see the insignias of their enemies. The strongest presence appears to be Afghanistan, which not only possesses a significant land presence but also is currently deploying a new weapon- a crawler. Currently undergoing maintenance in the city of Romitan, this Kandahar class crawler is the newest in Afghan military technology. Based on a Timorese design, It is a massive artillery cannon, with a barrel around 27 feet in diameter, that can strike targets over 100 miles away with 10-ton payloads.These can include cluster munitions, bioweapons, nuclear warheads, and firebombs. The most terrifying aspect of this engine of war, however, is that this massive cannon, supported with anti-air and support weaponry bristling from every side of the machine, can walk. Supported by 4 massive mechanical legs, the crawler looms over 150 feet in the air. This, combined with an impenetrable nanomaterial hull, makes it nearly unassailable from the ground. It is likely that the incorporation of such a weapon into the Afghan Imperial Forces will afford many victories in the future.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Arapaho war machine roars to life, as 4 giant death robots, a name coined by Incan soldiers, shortly before they were struck with dimensional weaponry that collapsed them into only 2 dimensions, batter down the walls of Huukyame. The Arapaho, ever obsessed with the latest advances in physics, use these nuclear fusion-powered automatons to wield cutting-edge arms that threaten the laws of physics themselves. Superweapons hailing from 3 of the 14 major weapons guilds of the Arapaho league. The nexus, an aircraft and support structure capable of hovering over half a mile in the air, a crawler, and the aforementioned giant death robots.</p>"

Meanwhile, a Babylonian undercover observer stationed in the city of Konkyan sits at a cafe, quietly sipping on a cup of Kokang-style coffee. They ponder the almost sickeningly sweet taste of it, and for a moment reminisce about the old Nigerian cafe they used to frequent. “More than a world away,” She thinks to herself, sighing and opening their laptop.

  narration: "<p>Due to the massive and difficult geography of Central Asia and Siberia, infantry combat is very rare here. This may also be attributed to the state of overextension in both the Afghan and Turkish militaries. This does not stop both sides from lobbing nuclear ICBMS over the border, to disrupt supply lines and spread fear and terror.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Herat, an old Afghan exclave in Oman, is likely to be captured by Turkish armed forces by the end of the year. Though it has put up a respectable defense throughout total war, the Battle of Herat seems to have closed the curtains on Afghanistan’s Arabian exclave. Turkish biotroopers have established a perimeter within the first two barriers of the city, and an assault on the third seems to be coming soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A fierce pitched battle rages outside Kilwa Kisiwani, as the few remaining citizens cower in what sections of the bunkers are still livable. This city, many decades ago, was the target of a global coalition, and, despite the odds, managed to maintain its dignity and independence. The native Kilwani are so few in number that they hardly matter anymore. Today, Kilwa Kisiwani is simply a well-located city vital to the strategic interests of both the Grand Republic of Timor and the Yemeni National State. Yemen maintains a higher concentration of troops around the cities, but Timor seems to hold the long-term advantage. In order to widen the front, Timorese high command has elected to launch an offensive towards the embattled city of Mbarara. Additionally, the Timorese navy has begun naval sorties in the Madagascar strait in order to deprive mainland Yemeni holdings of reinforcements.</p>"

The capital of the Hague is having the life crushed out of it. The Brandenburg navy bears down from the North, forming an unbreakable blockade. In the South, Anglo-Dutch power armor infantry, known worldwide for their superior manufacturing and design, battle a numerically superior Turkish force.

  narration: "<p>A pack of  Arapaho submarines passes dangerously close to Rio de Janeiro, the former capital of Brazil, but now just another city under Inca occupation. Surveying the continent through advanced observational reconnaissance devices, a private aboard one of the subs gasps in shock.“What happened here?” He shakily muttered. His captain, looking over the private’s shoulder, answered in a deliberate, serious tone: “They’re destroying it. All of it. The priesthood believes the Kayapo to be subhumans, and so they are going to reduce every city to rubble. Some people say the Priesthood has already killed nearly half of the Kayapo.”  </p><p>“But that’s almost 200 million people” answered the private, with a hint of a scoff in his voice” The captain simply said, “That is why we are going South, to save the ones who are left.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Malian soldiers enter Palermo. The old woman, upon being approached by one of the Malian power armor soldiers, did not seem afraid. The soldier seemed surprised at this, and hesitated before firmly asking the woman to remain indoors or to proceed to a shelter. “Oh, it’s alright. I’m just enjoying the warm weather.”Incredulous at this display of defiance, the soldier paused, before stating“Very well then. I guess the weather is pretty nice.” After a quick scan of his surroundings, the soldier asks the woman “May I sit with you?”</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Babylonian agent in Konkyan watches her laptop with tired eyes. Symbols moved around on a map, each representing different army units, cities, and geographical features, all in real-time. Technology like this was far beyond the inhabitants of the cylinder, even with their recent advances. Afghan units inch closer and closer to the Timorese-controlled cities of southern China and Burma. “I might have to move soon after all” she mused disappointedly. She had chosen this location because she thought that after the Grand Republic of Timor had conquered the area, it was only a matter of time before they won the game, and the front would only move farther and farther away. What a drag.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Timorese strategists have scratched their heads for many years as to how to put the cornered animal that is the Yemeni National State out of its misery. despite effectively encircling the island of Madagascar, Timorese naval and air efforts have been constantly stymied by Yemeni light ship fleets. Yemen uses incredibly fast light ships in large number to ambush, encircle, and destroy Timorese fleets before they can abscond or call for reinforcements. the response to this, according to Timorese strategists, is to utilize ambush tactics of their own. After using a feint attack elsewhere to draw out Yemeni strategic concentration, the Timorese navy launched a powerful assault on the shipyard city of Pemba. Timor will likely win this battle, but only time will tell whether they will win the war.</p>"

As she falls asleep, she thinks about the military situation in Southern China (a very normal thing to think about of course). Timor seems to be slipping, but she can’t wrap her head around why. Is the Afghan Imperial Army really that powerful? Why is Timor experiencing such bad supply issues? And most importantly, was she going to lose her bet over who will win it all? She rolled over and tried to focus on the Crawler's footsteps. Around 40 seconds between each one, she counted. </p>"

Plunder is a massive part of the Turkish economy, and it must flow to the capital if the Turkish war machine is to keep humming. They find little here, however, as the city already was ablaze. The Anglo-Dutch are a proud people, and readily destroy their own homes rather than surrender them to the enemy. This evidently includes their capital and largest city.

Arapaho war machines, beyond the comprehension of the simple citizens of the city, loom in the sky. “My head really hurts mommy” whined a toddler, while cowering in her home with her mother. “I’m sorry sweetheart” Her mother replied in a scared tone. Her head hurt too, and it was only getting worse.“It’s the fault of that machine up there,” and she pointed to the nexus, hovering ominously and silently. Psychological warfare is very effective, and the 12th Weapons Guild of the Arapaho League knows this. The device contained in the nexus looming over Taraz is a Noospheric disruptor, a cutting-edge psychic weapon that emits a field that erodes the willpower and energy of people within a 10-mile radius. It can win a siege without a single life lost. Long-term exposure to Noospheric disrupters can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, paranoia, depression, tiredness, psychosis, suicidal thoughts, and in extreme cases may induce a state of torpor.</p>"

The arrival of robot infantry to the battle has rendered useless many of the noospheric and memetic weapons utilized by the Arapaho. The Incan priesthood, upon capturing the megalopolis of Kremoro from the Kayapo, quickly petitioned Tupac Yupanqui, the Sapa Inca, Praetor, and powerless figurehead, to repurpose the “Skynet” network into something that can be applied to war. This request, shockingly to some but not to citizens of the Inca republic, was nearly instantly approved, and full custody, oversight, and confidence were granted to the priesthood, along with ample funding. The result is a mechanical army, capable of being mass-produced and remotely controlled, all entirely under the control of the priesthood.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a daring assault, the Mori-Mohave capture Chenxian, but it is unlikely to remain in their hands. Afghan military doctrine in this region has been to grind down Mohave resistance through attrition, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Where are all the troops coming from for all these suicide attacks?</p>"

  narration: "<p>While the de-jure capital of the Mohave is at Avi Hamoka, situated on the northernmost island of the Marianas, the de facto seat of power for the Mohave remnants is most certainly the Mori archipelago. Unlike the warlike and revanchist Mori-Mohave, the Mariana-Mohave are content to simply defend their islands. This, however, is not enough to save them, as their islands have recently come under attack by a small Timorese fleet. While it seems unlikely that they will capture a city now, it does not bode well for the continued existence of this Mohave successor state.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Konkyan falls, but the Babylonian agent supposed to be stationed there had left a long time ago. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Semiramis fidgets under her desk as she listens to the other immortals. Isabella was never supposed to get out, and she was definitely not supposed to have founded a new Burgos right next to the submarine. They had offered her true immortality, alongside the rest of them, but she had refused. They had to emergency relocate the sub. Now Semiramis was in deep shit. “So you’re an anti-war movement?” she asks “Yes,” curtly replied Isabella, as she continued. “We are aware our reality is artificial, and we are also aware that it is nothing more than a blood sport for your enjoyment. We are content to live as we are, in our own fake little cylinder, but we do not need to suffer. We kindly ask that you, Semiramis, act as our ambassador to the sub, and allow us, as a world, to negotiate for peace.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>On the other end of the cylinder from Mizque, Arapaho forces descend upon the city of Nevkat, capturing it. Afghanistan is in a prime position to retake the city, however, and is likely that all the lives lost in the assault will have been in vain.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brandenburg renews its offensive in Scandinavia, and actually manages to damage both Lyda and Oranienburg. The Brandenburg government has even begun integrating Biotroopers into their forces, which will grant them much-needed numbers and coverage. The Brandenburg national anthem can be heard from outside Oranienburg, heralding to the civilians that their liberators have arrived. Turkish authorities struggle to contain the nationalistic fervor in the city, and many fear that civilian sabotage may lead to the collapse of the defense.  </p>"

But why me?” She managed to stutter it out, poorly hiding her uncomfortableness at the situation. “It’s simpler than you think. Babylonian agents are hard to track down, and most are too flighty to catch. you simply were a bit sloppy with your cover.” said Raoni. “We‘ve been trying for years now to bring one of you in.”  Semiramis sighed. It’s a little embarrassing to be the only one they had ever caught. “What do you think?” asked Isabella. After mulling it over, Semiramis answered. “I’ll try to help. If you’re aware of the game, then the game might not be worth continuing anyway. I’ll ask my boss.” With that brief reply, Semiramis, realizing that she needed to return to the sub immediately, activated her emergency spatial shifter, and teleported onto the familiar deck of the sub. She promptly doubled over as her vision swam, and her stomach churned with nausea. “I guess there’s a reason it’s emergency use only, “ she thought as she ran for the nearest railing. </p>"

F</p><p></p><p>And now for the eulogy, which is of course not in-lore. The Anglo-Dutch overperformed by  magnitudes. While they were never a serious contender for victory, they fought their own irrelevance at every turn, and had so many memorable moments, such as the invasion of England and their fateful capture of Berlin,the capital of the civ that was, for a long time, believed to be one war declaration away from wiping the AD off the map. In the end, they put up a heroic defense, and definitely left an impression on me and a lot of other people on the sub.</p><p></p><p>The CBR has been close to my heart since MK2, and I’m grateful to be able to give back to a community that has given so much to me. Narrating this episode was really fun, and I’m excited to contribute more in the future. Again, this is U/QuantumBotany, and thank you all for reading.</p>"
