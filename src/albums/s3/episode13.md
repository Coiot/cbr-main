    narration: "<p>Welcome, one and all, to the Civ Battle Royale... X! I’m your narrator for today, /u/ExplosiveWatermelon - I’m a fan of the show, have been for over 5 years at this point. I’m also the co-creator of Kokang, the Beast of Burma this season.Normally I don’t have much to say here, but I figure it’s worth saying that I’ve really appreciated seeing all the people returning to the show and interacting on the subreddit. With that, let’s get on with the pre-show.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>As much as Irataba tries to hide it, he knows there’s a great mistake in his calculations to take Captain Jack’s Stronghold- unlike a certain other Captain Jack, Kintpuash is not a sailing man, and his capital is not on the coast. To make matters worse, his most trusted admiral was not an admiral of the seas, but rather one of the skies.</p><details><summary>LORE</summary><p>She claimed she could make wings out of wax and feathers and attach it to her boats. However, the boats flew too close to the sun and plummeted back into the cylinder.

    narration: "<p>Sir Thomas Roe, ambassador of the Permians, has been assigned to make friendly relations with the nearest City-State. Unfortunately, City-States don’t actually exist, so instead he spent his time awkwardly chatting with people at the taverns of Uros, trying to explain what his job actually entails.Due to his travels, we get to see both the restoration of the Permian state, and the army affairs of Vladimir. Vladimir has a pretty solidified army, whereas the Permians have been incorporating their conquests from Khazaria.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Tuva finally builds a Citadel outside of Qarakhoja, but unfortunately, Qocho has already been conquered by Han. While Tuva might have the numbers advantage, the terrain heavily favors Han soldiers. If Qocho managed to win by doing nothing, I don’t think there’s any chance Tuva would be able to push through Han soldiers- especially with their Worker-centric composition.</p><p></p><p>Gokturks, on the other hand…</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Kayapo, a constant thorn in the Americas, might just be the Kingmaker of the CBR. They’re not gonna win- their unit composition of “Trees” and “Bananas” suggests otherwise. However, their unique Granary- the Uncuã- provides some powerful growth bonuses that can be seen in the fact that Gorotire has a population of 46. However, these cities aren’t being used to help their own conquests- in fact, their only general is Timur, known for his failures during Mark 2. The real winner isn’t the Kayapo, but rather, whoever can take the Kayapo cities- and right now, it looks like that’s the Muisca.</p>"

    narration: "<p>It seems that Mr. Seaweed has had his Taxis captured and set ablaze by Poundmaker. Thinking quickly, he urges for a peace deal with the Inca-“If we can’t handle an enemy at our front door, how are we supposed to handle an enemy at our BACK door?” he justifies. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Tupac Yupanqui gets a letter in the mail informing him of the peace deal. “Oh, I forgot about that war,” he says, before tossing the letter through a basketball hoop that conveniently hangs over his trash can.</p><p></p><p>In more serious matters, I don’t think the Cree can really get farther. They’re razing Tsaxis, which would’ve been their only city on the West Coast. That also means they don’t really have the ability to take the Kwakwaka’wakw cities by sea, forcing Poundmaker to traverse the mountains. Famed Cree general, Sargon, has his work cut out for him</p>"

    scene_title: "No-dock Modoc"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>The fighting seems to have died down in this region. I don’t think Agawesh is going to switch teams anytime soon- the Rocky Mountains have almost guaranteed that. Still, there’s one competitor who stands a chance- Captain Jack, otherwise known as Pintuash, who is currently throwing small stones at Mohave vessels.</p><p></p><p>Say hi to Kodama Gentaro in Modoc territory! Unfortunately for him, I side with Tokugawa and the Shinsengumi (Speaking of, I believe Okita Soji appeared in a previous episode.) I don’t think he can expel many “barbarians” when there aren’t any encampments on this map, but he could potentially help expel the Kwakwaka’wakw from Agawesh, returning the city to its rightful owner. That said, it won’t mean much in the long run, and it’s unlikely while the Modoc are under siege from the Mohave.</p><p></p><p>Also, if you look closely, you’ll see the Kwakwaka’wakw have failed to flip Tsaxis. That means the city’s done for- the mod that makes Civilizations stop razing cities can’t save cities that are at 1 population.</p>"

    scene_title: "Timbs for Less"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>I won’t hide my bias- Timor-Leste has become my favorite civ in this royale. Yes, even above my own civ, who is still performing wonderfully. The reason why? They’ve gone from Shoeshine to full Underdog. I think a large part of it is due to the religion they’ve founded- Timor-Leste is a militaristic civ that derives a lot of its bonuses from their religion, and since Timor-Leste founded a really good one, they can actually make use of their Military Units being stronger when adjacent to Religious Units. With the addition of a reformation belief (signaling that Timor-Leste has gained another policy in the Piety branch) they can further establish their regional dominance…</p><p></p><p>At least, for now.</p>"

    scene_title: "Samandar? I hardly know ‘er!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Samandar is down to the red with Turkish units surrounding the city. They’re all horsemen, but let’s be honest- there’s no recovery for Khazaria at this point. Even if they DON’T get exiled to Tamantarkhan, they’re just another cog in another civ’s war machine. Their death won’t even matter because Atil has already fallen. It’s quite unfortunate. I think the civ’s really good- but their performance ends here.</p>"

    scene_title: "Worship never changes"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>In the territory of the Mohave, the Paro Taktsang opens up for people who either want to achieve enlightenment, or take some selfies that make them look “cultured.” Well, they might not succeed in making themselves look anything but vain, but the high entrance fee will definitely make the Mohave feel cultured. No, seriously, it generates +1 Culture and +1 Faith from mountains- decent for a civ this close to the Rockies, but still rather weak.</p>"

    scene_title: "Religion Map"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>Often, these more informative slides go overlooked because they don’t seem as “fun.” However, there’s some important things to note here-</p><p></p><p>First, the Buddhist religion founded by the late Qocho seems sure to fade into obscurity as Tengrist practices take over east Asia. </p><p></p><p>Second, South and Southeast Asia are rather irreligious at this moment in time- although Arianism looks to be making its way into the mainland. Note that religions aren’t just good for their founder, but also those who follow them- a civilization without a religion is at a disadvantage against those who do. This also means Afghanistan, which follows Sunni, has yet ANOTHER advantage over poor Pandya.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>The previously-mentioned Reformation bonus that Arianism gained is Indulgences, which I must say is a pretty strong one:</p><p></p><p>+1 Food, +1 Production, +1 Science, +1 Gold, +1 Culture, and +1 Faith in Cities following this Religion.Yes, +1 to every standard yield, just for worshiping Arianism. This is a pretty strong bonus to Timor-Leste, whose cities all follow the religion.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In what sounds like a lovely meal, Chile falls upon the Plata! Tucuman hasn’t taken damage yet, and the units that surround it are mainly cavalry- they won’t last too long. That said, it’ll help clear out the few Rioplatanese units defending the area. Hannibal god-damn Barca is commanding from the comfort of the capital.

    narration: "<p>In a twist that rocks the foundation of the world, beloved North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung takes over the state with assistance of the military, establishing a dictatorship putting him in absolute control!This changes nothing, as Kim Il-Sung was already an immortal leader destined to rule North Korea for eternity. Still, it has made life even more miserable for the citizens of North-and-South Korea.</p><p></p><p>I should note: Han has a decent navy within striking distance of Chongjin, whereas the Korean navy consists of a fishing boat with a chariot on it. Honestly, that doesn’t seem too pleasant for either the crew or the horses.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Stretch those eye muscles because the Inca have decided that the Kayapo are, like, so 2022. They don’t have much of an army to send shivers through Raoni’s botoque, but there are two significant issues for Raoni:First, Kuben-kran-kren is on-par with the defense of cities like Machu and Chan Chan. That means the Inca physically CAN take it, but whether they will is another matter.Second, the Muisca are still at war with the Kayapo, and because they both hold one of the other’s cities, it doesn’t seem like a peace deal will happen so easily.</p><p></p><p>Also, the United States joined in, because it wouldn’t be America if a Roosevelt didn’t support a war in Latin America somehow.</p>"

He has lovingly picked out a name for every boat, however, the choice of names has raised several questions.</p><p></p><p>“A strong navy means a lot in the mediterranean,” said Capt. William LXXXVII Hauteville, captain of the famed vessel Robert Guiscard’s Facepuncher, “So having a name that spreads fear is important. That said, I don’t know whose face a ship would be able to punch…”</p><p></p><p>Robert, having grown attached to the ships he lovingly named, is a bit worried about sending them to war. He doesn’t want them to get hurt, after all.</p>"

This might sound like I’m making some weird joke, but no, Irataba actually did have a Katana. </p><p></p><p>On the route of his bizarre adventure, he starts settling a few cities on the islands of Hawaii. The Ming seem to have gotten the best bit, but this could still be useful as a bridge to Asian conquests. That said, it seems a bit too early for them to be of much use.</p>"

Sure, it’d be a pretty easy push- but Olive hasn’t sent her boys anywhere close to Phnom Penh, and the city’s got a carpet of Composite Bowmen. I could see this potentially opening the way for Indonesia to snipe another city from Olive’s clutches.</p><p></p><p>Sihanouk’s response has been to taunt Prince Olive Yang, flipping the bird and referring to her solely as “Miss Hairy Legs.”</p>"

Even if Chile flips it, their attention is mainly on the northern front- Rio de la Plata’s triremes can flip it a few more times, but Allende only has two melee units within range after that.</p>"

No diss track or anything. The matter is, words don’t win wars- the constant expenditure of human lives does. He doesn’t need to be flashy, he needs to take Longbian before Wu can push forward with his invasion- and to his credit, Yongle seems to be doing well.

He doesn’t care. Or rather, there’s a part of him curious to see if Micanopy could pull it off- but the truth is, the Seminole lost their chance.

    narration: "<p>Franklin Delano doesn’t seem like the right type of Roosevelt to take over the Caribbean, but he has to uphold the family legacy somehow! That said, these cities aren’t well defended- outside of the waters that naturally defend them, there’s no navy nearby, and the locations of the cities actually make them pretty easy to invade. La Serena and Cleveland both jut out, and Detroit is a 1-tile island. If Muisca builds up a navy, they could use that as a stepping stone for North American conquests.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Turns out, a lot of people hate rap. Turkey, the Zulus, and the Maori all declare war on Han. However, if you look in the top left, it seems Tuva hasn’t damaged Qarakhoja yet, and there’s a bunch of Chariot Archers nearby who can potentially postpone the inevitable. If Han is able to maintain most of their borders, they’ll likely recover.</p><p></p><p>Also, what an eventful turn this has been! Look at all those notifications!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Chile’s scouting efforts seem to be paying off, as they realize Mendoza is completely undefended and send a lot of Triremes to take it. Also, look at Brazil’s navy in the north.</p>"

    narration: "<p>If there’s any saving grace for Han at this point, it’s that their downfall will be very entertaining- Olive Yang has entered the ring on the side of Tuva. Whether or not she succeeds, things are NOT looking good for Wu- he might have to hang up his du rag and put on his don’t rag.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Hey, look, Mori settled another city! It only took… oh dear.</p><p></p><p>Mori Motonari has dropped the ball hard. He’s looking more like a Prince Beggar than a Beggar Prince at this point. Even his navy, which the civ is centered around, seems rather lackluster. Oof.</p>"

    scene_title: "I can see the Gokturks from Essipit!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene91.jpg
    narration: "<p>The brand-new Cree Settlement of Essipit, perhaps one of the worse settles we’ve seen thus far, is already under siege. Whatever happened to the invasion of Tigwaxsti that was being launched under Lafayette? Good question. Anyways,</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene92.jpg
    narration: "<p>Naoe Kanetsugu was a notable samurai who was once page to the great daimyo Uesugi Kenshin. Unfortunately for him, I’m a Takeda Shingen fangirl, and thus I despise him already.</p><p></p><p>Also, he’s in the Anglo-Norse territory. Canute cannot compete, I’m afraid.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Pasig was captured so cleanly by Indonesia it honestly feels like it’s already been a part of their empire forever. They’re already launching a further invasion towards Malolos, which probably won’t go as far- but who knows?</p>"

    scene_title: "Bek for Mercy"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene94.jpg
    narration: "<p>Samandar, firmly in the hands of Ataturk, takes the last bit of damage from a Khazar ship before Bulan finally throws in the towel. There’s nothing left for him but to accept his role as a cog in the works. Honestly, it’s a bit sad- a lot of the folks I’ve spoken to on the CBR discord love the mod, but they simply can’t keep up with the Caucasus TSL.</p>"

    scene_title: "No Olive branches today"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene95.jpg
    narration: "<p>Zhuoxian takes some damage as a minor force approaches it from the south. Olive is striking hard, and striking fast- her initial invasionforce is mainly horsemen and chariot archers (near Jianye)- which makes sense, since they can chip away at defenses until an infantry force is able to complete the conquests.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Irutaba’s Hawaiian tour continues, as he has two more settlers raring to settle whatever island he can find. He’s getting really close to Japan- however, I think he’ll be disappointed to find there are no subtitles.</p>"

    scene_title: "Petty Nose"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode13-scene97.jpg
    narration: "<p>It seems Pretty Nose has gathered up her forces one more time to try and push for Agawesh. They’d been constantly struggling to get through the rockies the entire episode, so seeing them break through? They might be able to take the city, now that there’s not many soldiers left to defend it. Still, one might raise the point of how many lives were lost just to take this one city. She’s almost like the Arapaho Francisco Solano Lopez.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Managua has been settled, bringing Central America up to 4 cities!... which would’ve been impressive over a hundred turns ago. However, as the major North American powers rise up, it seems like they’ve spent most of the game just… wasting time.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mungabareena is settled in southern Aus, and it looks like the Maori are aiming to get an inland city in the mix as well? However, I think a more significant thing to note- the army of the Wiradjuri seems to have centralized around the Maori colonies.</p>"

    scene_title: "All Dead, All Dead"

    narration: "<p>Semiramis wanders around the streets of Nimrud, feeling a sense of nostalgia. Where once were children, playing in the streets, she sees soldiers bearing turkish banners. She feels a bit of panic, but she remembers her duty. Much like the gardens that hung above Babylon, she too must simply watch over the city. For now, she hears a bit of gossip- two soldiers, arguing over how long the trip to Mali will be.</p><p></p><p>Before I go, I want to make a shout-out to Coiot’s director cut for this episode- he mentioned there being a lot of Great People names he found and wasn’t able to include due to the length of this episode. I’m very happy that I was able to narrate this episode, and I hope you enjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for reading, everyone! Stay tuned!</p>"
