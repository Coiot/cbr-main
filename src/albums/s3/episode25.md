      narration: "<p>We begin our gander across the world map with a look at the Pandya. 2 episodes ago, we were optimistic that they might yank a city away from the Afghans. This episode, we’re optimistic that they’re gonna lose at least one city to the Afghans. And with the technological and numerical supremacy on the Afghans side, there may be more to come. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We then mosey on over onto the Tarim Basin, where the Han and Gokturks continue to duke it off. One of the most defining features of this war is the fact that the Gokturks are losing despite their numerical superiority against the Han. In fact, currently you can count a few more Gokturk troops on the border, and they are about even tech. I guess the Han just know how to fight wars good. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Whew, thats enough anger at Ireland out of my system. Anyway, we take a gander onto Egypt, where the titular civ makes its last stand. Lost and abandoned in the city of Akenathen for centuries, the Egyptians make endless offerings to the sun god Ra, and many divinations in hopes for victory against the invading Chadians, such efforst buoyed by Pandyan war hero Vijaya Wimalaratne*. The Chads, ofc, do not care, because prayers to God won’t do much against their much superior guns. </p><p></p><p>*In real life, Vijaya was possibly Sri Lankas most distinguished field marshall </p>"

      narration: "<p>We take a gander back to Indonesia, where Suharto’s Indonesia… adopts communism. Ironic. He became what he wished to destroy. Guess external pressure and those Turkish kickbacks were just a bit too scrumptious. In the meantime, his troops have surrounded Yogyakarta, and seem poised to take it. </p>"

The Kayapo continue a slow and cautious advance, treating this war like just about everything they’ve been doing this game. Troop formations are dispersed and a bit sparse, but given the overwhelming technological superiority and the frontline, I find it hard to not see the Rio De La Plata not losing more. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Moving onto central Asia, we witness the flipside of the Afghan Intervention - the Permians have continued to make great progress in their southward thrust, having firmly secured Lashkargah. The Afghan army, au contraire to their fairly heavy force in India, is nowhere to be seen here, giving the Permians free reign over Central Asia. Could this preside the dawn of a new superpower? </p><p></p><p>Also the Malians enter the modern era, putting them on the same tech level as some of our other top tier contenders </p>"

      narration: "<p>We mosey over to Australia, where the large Wiradjuri port of Maraekowhai is under assault by fearsome Timorese destroyers. While said force is a bit scattered, and the Wiradjuri have the resources for a flip, a landing in this area would be devastating for the Wiradjuri and highly advantageous for the Timorese. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Looking at the Black sea, we see what Turkey has seen for the past several episodes. After 5 or 6 episodes worth of fruitless war against the Kyivan Rus, the Turks finally seize Polotsk. For some information, Polotsk is the reason why there is no city in the straits of Bosporus this game, as you can see by that one Kyvian tile over there. Must be quite satisfying to at least own the tile that enables access between seas. </p>"

      narration: "<p>In the Tsardom of Perm, change abounds. With the conquest of Vladimir and the Glorious Offensive of the south, the kingdom’s prosperity has never been so high, but its peoples wealth remains low. One Vladimir Lenin, former politician in Vladimir, holds a speech, calling for change and peace, work and bread for all peoples of Perm. Azkay takes these words to heart, and declares Perm a Soviet Union of its peoples. </p>"

Get them all together in a communal singing of course! And try to get them to henceforth fight the Timorese, of course. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We unfortunately do not witness whos the third civ who got an ideology this turn. However, we do get to witness the Kilwan town of Sofala get pounded by a mighty Afghan force! It seems like the Afghans have invested a fairly significant naval force in this area, and the Kilwans have not divested a single military unit. This city is probably becoming Afghan soon, whether they like it or not. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Jonas Savimbi erroneously declares war against the Zulu. Unfortunately, theres a little known natural barrier called “Botswana” blocking his way into their lands, but it matters not. His elite shadow team of filibusterers and adventurers are lined up by the Cape of Good Hope and ready to move in for the kill. With the Zulu themselves fairly weakened, who knows how good this can go? </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Malians take a page from the book of Mansa Musa as they seek to redistribute their immense wealth and become communist. The Malian empire itself, though sparse and in some aspects, backwards, is looking rather fine, especially for an African civ. With their rival the Normans growing stronger though, they should watch their 6 and get a move on. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We move over to the Bering Strait, as the Gokturks successfully reclaim the formerly Kwakwaka'wakw city of Dzawadi from the Cree. The two have been locked in a great duel over ownership of the former Ducklad lands, with the Cree being the instigators. Cree ships send Gokturk troops to watery graves, and the Gokturks toss the bodies of Cree prisoners into the frigid ocean. This one might just be a bout of permafrost folks. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode25-scene21.jpg
      narration: "<p>And barely a turn after choosing an ideology, the Wiradjuri decide to break the chains of traditional ideological conventions and instead call for nationalistic pride in order to fend off the Timorese invasion. With how quickly civs are going for Spirit, it really makes you think - why is this happening? Is Spirit really that strong of an ideology? Or is the AI just kinda stupid?</p>"

      scene_title: "You Know That One Civ Meme?"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode25-scene22.jpg
      narration: "<p>So, you guys know that one Civ 5 meme? The one where it just shows a guy steamrolling over their enemies with superior technology, using clips from the anime Gate. Yeah, thats exactly whats happening here. The Turkish force in Ukraine consists of a single landship, a single Line Infantry, a lone frigate and two cavalry divisions. And yet, this has thus far been more than enough to deter the Rus army, which continues to use medieval tactics and equipment. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Okay Ahmad Shah, we get it, you have a big dick. You have a military big enough to project power as far down as Africa, with a force massive enough to blot out the sun in Sofala. Lets see if that force could allow you to not get penetrated up north, huh? </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode25-scene24.jpg
      narration: "<p>We take a small glance at the Muisca, with a particular focus on their great musician, experimental American-British producer and pop star Scott Walker. In real life, he was known for a series of eponymous albums that were noted for their great sonic variation and experimentation. As for the Muisca themselves, they’re decent, they got a decent carpet, their only real issue is that the practically only have one target to heave their weight at, and even then they have to time it to perfection. But who cares, lets just listen to the music baby!</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Northern Campaign of the Han continues with incredible force as they recapture Chenxian and make a concentrated effort towards Gol-Zaijin. Though they don’t have many forces, the Han have grit, quality and incredible tactics, and so we can only imagine how far they’ll go. Because they won’t have truce with their northern furies, not for a while longer anyhow. </p>"

      narration: "<p>With Yogyakarta recaptured, we finally achieve what I thought won’t happen in Indonesia - a congentially owned Sumatra. Given the state of both combatants, it seems like further progress on either end is unlikely, though we shall see in the future. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We get to see the other clown in the Anglo-Irish war, the Anglo-Dutch. Currently, they seem to be languishing in the mainland and Britain, a little worse for wear, and definitely becoming the laughingstock of the PR’s after throwing away Amsterdam to the Normans. But who knows? Maybe all they need for a comeback is getting rid of the worst city in the Netherlands.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode25-scene30.jpg
      narration: "<p>The Gokturk force around the Tarim Basin has started dissipating. The stress of a war on two fronts and the sheer concentration of Han forces have prevented them from being able to effectively retaliate on any. Nevertheless, they are desperate not to lose their core lands without a fight. Otuken has been reclaimed by a couple of cavalry divisions, and the flips continue. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Moving back over to South Asia, we see that the Pandya are in dire straits, as they lose Mannar to a lone Afghan destroyer. They have a fleet of frigates off their coast, but it seems like they refuse to use them for one reason or another. On the bright side, both it and Thoothukudi should flip back to them soon. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Brandenburgers, needing more bodies to pile onto the assault on Zagreb, decide to begin integrate nationalist elements into their socialist form of governance. This union of black and scarlet brings upon a new outlook towards their empire, though they are still being stalemated in Zagreb. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Thoothukudi flips back to the hands of the Pandya as the Afghan force slides back into the shadows. Looks like their conquests will have to wait a bit. Though, lets be real here, the Pandya are a joke and can easily be broken by their neighbours at this point. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Gokturks retake Chenxian, but the Han are retaliating with full firepower. Not only have they resecured Otuken, they have Chenxian surrounded and Gol-Zarrun in the red. The fire and fury will rage on in the north for a while longer, it seems. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Timor-Wiradjuri war comes to an abrupt end, as the Wiradjuri end violence by giving up the city of Doomut. Though this is a victory for the Timorese, this may just be a better form of loss aversion to the Wiradjuri, who were in threat of losing their much larger cities up the north and the east. Nevertheless, the best warriors are the ones who yield the least bloodshed, are they not? And Timor did make good gains. </p>"

      narration: "<p>A small, but sizeable regiment of Turks begin to make a march toward Kyiv. The Rus warriors and guards attempt their best to beat them back, but spears and bolts merely deflect off their secret weapon of their 1st Landship regiment, if they hadn’t already been mowed down by rifles and muskets. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Alright, its time for government analysis time! We begin here with a series of military juntas, including the Cree and Chadians.

      narration: "<p>Moving down the governments list, we have the monarchies. Interestingly, from the list provided, only the Gokturks, Yemenis and Permians are generally thought of as relevant powers. The way of kings does not bely well in this age and era, it seems. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Here bely a few more monarchies. Of course, the star of the show is the Brandenburger Reich, whos ruler, Fredrich Wilhelm I, has been granted the epithet of Captain of the People, Commander in Chief of the Expeditionary Force against the Barbarians, by the Will of the Nation, King of Brandenburg. Really long title for a civ who has been a bit quiet until recently, hasn’t it? We also get to see the 4 monastic orders, with the Lithuanian’s odd crusade being highly explained by their status as crusaders. </p>"

      narration: "<p>A bit further down, we witness the principalities and nomad hordes of this world. The Mohave are a communist principality, not that weird when you realize that many communist states retain monarchies in this world. The Afghans and Kokang also follow this government type, though the Chileans We also make note of several of the modern hordes - the Turks and Muisca have notably adopted this government type, alongside the previously witnessed Arapaho and Irish. I wonder what about nomadism makes it appealing in this world…</p>"

We of course have the Socialist Republic of Indonesia and the ever-so-spirited Republic of Timor-Leste, the plucky Greenlandic Republic, the good ole’ USA (ruled by the fascists) and the Republic of the Sun (Inca). While not the most popular government type, most of the republics are doing quite well for themselves I must say. </p>"

The Kayapo have impressively stayed on a confederation of sorts for millenia, while the Anglo-Dutch have appeared to provide a more loose form of representation for their peoples. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Alright, back to the action! It seems those Black Ops teams didn’t do so hot, but were successful in gathering information about Zulu defenses, which is to say, they have no defenses. Emboldened, Savimbi begins plans for a more comprehensive attack of the Zulu, planning to simply move their units around the natural barrier of Botswana and make a direct headway into the Cape of Good Hope. </p>"

      narration: "<p>We take a brief look at the Incan pacific, where Incan scientists have successfully invented a unique machine to get closer to the sun. Of course, a quick intel search would reveal that the Mohave and Timorese have successfully created similar machines already, and that said machines can be highly effective for destroying the enemy from the skies. With the position of these newly minted babes on the Pacific, the Inca can potential rain terror over the Maori or Wiradjuri. But for now, they simply sit there praising the sun. </p>"

They scream daggers into each others eyes, and surround the quivering Argentine garrison with gunpowder and brimstone. The race for Machu is on. The Kayapo legions have the numerical advantage, but the Incans have some good units positioned nearby and the homecourt advantage. I wonder whos gonna get the city at the end of this…</p>"

      narration: "<p>William III makes a concentrated attempt to put the “England” back in “Anglo-Dutch,” as he mounts a concentrated offensive near Rotterdam. The Anglo-Dutch seem determined to turn things around this time, and the Irish look way worse for wear, with little in the way of resistance to this affair. We also see the Anglo-Dutch Frigate UU, the Man O’War, which, if it were blockading Rotterdam, should put it into resistance and which also increases the chance of defections from the Dutch UA, which make enemy units near cities of their religion have a chance to defect. The Irish, of course, have their homegrown Oriental Orthodoxy, meaning this UA is kinda moot. Nevertheless, could this lead to a Dutch dub? </p>"

They need to unite the spirit of the people in order to truly defeat their enemy at home court! With that spirit in hand, the Anglo-Dutch become communist and attempt to send more units over the channel to reinforce assaults up north, while the spectre of Amsterdam remains, a reminder of a humiliating blunder that will never fade away. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Barely a turn passes, and the Timorese have already secured Makassar from the Indonesians, with Palembang also open for assault. Up in the north, the vast Indonesian army present attempts to push through Battambang and Maliana, though their technological inferiority may cause progress to be minimal. Needless to say, theres a clear winner right now, and its not Suharto as we all originally thought.</p>"

      narration: "<p>We end the episode with another, distinctly less expected Timor-Leste gain - the Zulu city of Ndondakusuka near the frigid wastes of Antarctica. The contingent that seized this city is a small, but hardened, group of destroyers and frigates, not high in number but potentially good enough to be a thorn on the Zulu’s sides since they are two eras behind the Timorese. And even if that doesn’t happen, thats a forward operating base for future incursions into Africa. Anyhow, thats all folks, this is JDT1706, and tune in next week for another episode of the Civ Battle Royale!</p>"
