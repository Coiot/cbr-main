      narration: "<p>Hello and welcome to the 28th episode of the third season of this wonderful game where we watch fake countries kill each other! It’s me again, Admiral Cloudberg, your head power ranker, part-time CBR dev, and author of excruciatingly detailed accounts of plane crashes. I tend to focus on analysis over lore, but we’ve had a lot of lore-heavy narrations recently, so hopefully this satisfies those out there who are as interested in the game as we all are in the story.  And if you’re anything like me, you’ve probably spent the past week eagerly awaiting today’s installment and have been unable to function for the past several hours out of sheer anticipation, so anyway, let’s get right into it.</p>"

      narration: "<p>For our power ranking slide this week, I’ve chosen to highlight the former #1 ranked Permians, who have taken a 25-point slide as they face elimination at the hands of Turkey and Tuva. This is the most any civ’s rank has changed in one episode since the early game, and by a lot.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Our opening shot of the cylinder this week takes us to northern Japan, where the Gokturks are securing their hold over the Mori cities of Miiri-Takamatsu and Usukeshi. Although Mori Motonari has a large number of crossbowmen sitting on Honshu bombarding Miiri-Takamatsu, the city seems certain to stay in Gokturk hands, because Mori doesn’t have any boats in the Sea of Japan, which seems like a major strategic oversight. They do have some embarked melee units, but those will be swiftly destroyed by Gokturk frigates, and in any case, their route to the city is blocked by what appears to be a very lonely Seminole scout.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The end is fast approaching for Botswana as Angola captures both Francistown and Molepolole, on top of their capture of Selibe-Phikwe last episode. Mounted units are already surging across the desert toward Gaborone, backed up by aerial support from at least seven airplanes. In contrast, Botswana is defending its capital with medieval crossbowmen and knights. Although I was expecting Botswana to make it to total war, because that seems in character, it looks like I will be proved wrong. Elimination is imminent.</p>"

      narration: "<p>In North America, mighty WWI-era tank armies clash on the freezing steppes of North Dakota and the vast forests of Ontario, where the Cree are solidly on the defensive. Although Poundmaker has more troops on paper, Arapaho has a clear advantage due to their overwhelming air superiority. Pretty Nose has 28 airplanes in this image to Poundmaker’s zero, which is allowing the smaller Arapaho army to rapidly tear through its enemies. Philadelphia has already fallen to yellow, and although the Cree have managed to take back Kapawe No, the overall strategic situation for the boys in blue appears dire.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Artillery rings out over white sand beaches as the Inca and Cree close in on the Ming Hawaii stronghold of Guiyang. The city will likely fall within the next turn, but to whom? The Cree currently have the better positioning, with a destroyer in front of the city and artillery landing on the island’s northern shore, but if I read the observer interface correctly, Ming will have the next move. If the badly damaged Cree destroyer dies, then either aggressor could end up in control of this strategic island metropolis.</p>"

      narration: "<p>As we saw last episode, Han has captured both remaining Ming mainland cities, and now Wu’s troops are mopping up the last Ming units still resisting his advance. Ming has now been exiled to some islands off the Chinese coast... wait, where have we heard this story before?</p><p></p><p>Anyway, unlike in our world, Han will likely be able to take the Ming island cities due to its overwhelmingly superior firepower, and Yongle is staring down elimination at the hands of his many enemies. Han is also assisted in this effort by Tong Yabghu, who was a Gokturk Qaghan between 618 and 628. Apparently having been captured during the fall of Otuken, he is now serving his former enemy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, I’d like to note that the Mohave attack on Kokang has failed, and in fact Kokang is looking rather strong, with large numbers of artillery and airplanes defending every inch of its territory.</p>"

      narration: "<p>After just spending a whole slide talking about how Mori wasn’t going to recapture Miiri-Takamatsu, they’ve gone and done exactly that, using an embarked knight. Stacking multiple types of penalties vs. cities didn’t stop them, apparently. It will flip back, especially with at least 13 Gokturk airplanes having arrived in the region, but I commend them for trying.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Ming’s Hawaiian outpost of Guiyang has fallen to the Inca, who managed to get a ship into the city before the Cree could do the same! That leaves Ming’s remaining cities at the mercy of Han, which is to say, they’re fucked. Meanwhile, the Inca might struggle to defend this city if attacked by the Mohave. Will Irataba realize? If so, that would be a naval war of truly epic proportions.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Here’s the front we probably all were dying to see, and as expected, it’s bad news for the Permians. Turkey has captured the provisional Permian capital of Idnakar, while Tuva has advanced into Telsiai, cutting off Cherdyn from Ekspera and Kuva. One of those cities is already taking damage, and it seems Turkey is trying to race Tuva to the very shores of the Arctic Ocean.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Ataturk’s most talented scientists and engineers have launched their most impressive wonder yet: the Hubble Space Telescope, whose mission is to scan the distant cosmos for evidence of the universe’s origins. Of course, there’s nothing there, because they live in a simulation. Ataturk decides not to make this discovery public so as not to cause panic.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode28-scene15.jpg
      narration: "<p>In one fell swoop, Angola demolishes the defenses of Gaborone and marches into the city, eliminating Seretse Khama of Botswana in 44th place.</p><p></p><p>Botswana went into this season with low expectations. Their playstyle is peaceful and their starting location was poor, stuck in the desert in between the Zulus and Angola with little room to expand. In episode 0, we ranked Botswana 56th, so in that sense at least they exceeded expectations, albeit not by much. They eventually founded 6 cities, including their capital, but they never held all 6 at the same time, and they periodically lost or gave away outlying cities to their stronger neighbors. For a while, they sat doing nothing, and by the middle of episode 27 it looked like they were finally about to best their eternal rivals, the Zulus. But it was not to be. Angola’s invasion swiftly destroyed them, while Cetshwayo lives on, at least for now.</p>"

      narration: "<p>On board a frigate in the East China Sea, Yongle rallies the few troops he has left, promising to fight to the end. Fueled by desperation and pride, several Ming units launch a last-ditch attack on Shuntian, retaking the city and catching Han by surprise! Wu has no units in place to immediately recapture it, so this bold move could prolong the war by at least several turns.</p>"

      narration: "<p>After a stunning comeback in episode 27, Yugoslavia is continuing to advance into Brandenburg, moving its units for an attack on Königsburg. Several artillery units are in position, and so far Brandenburg’s massive air superiority has failed to stop them. If Frederick-William doesn’t use all those airplanes to take out Yugoslavia’s advancing armies, he might find himself down another city, or worse, even his capital. Overall, an unthinkable outcome for a civ that was supposed to be a top 10 power.</p>"

      narration: "<p>As a large Arapaho force advances on Sturgeon Lake, the Cree are struggling to mount a credible counterattack, as their units keep getting destroyed in massive aerial bombing runs. A lone rifleman has managed to cut the supply chains to Hinenitee Toh-nooxeih-t, but it’s all by itself and will soon be killed. A few Cree units are trying to approach the Arapaho capital, but no siege units have moved into range, and one has to imagine that Arapaho airplanes would demolish them if they tried. </p>"

      narration: "<p>From this scene, it’s clear that the Mohave invasion of Kokang is failing, as mentioned earlier. Mohave’s ships are unable to pass between Luzon and Taiwan thanks to Kokang’s robust defenses, and there’s nothing to suggest that a breakthrough might be imminent.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile in the upper left, Han has begun an operation to recapture Shuntian, although Yongle personally urges his expeditionary forces to hold the line.</p><p></p><p>Farther to the south, Timor-Leste watches carefully with the world’s first fleet of submarines. A few of the world’s first battleships have also made an appearance in Timorese lands, preparing to wreak havoc on whatever enemy Xanana Gusmão targets next.</p>"

      narration: "<p>An overview of Kilwa lands reveals a civilization without any options remaining. All of Kilwa’s neighbors are either stronger, or are Uganda, which is invincible. In a war with Timor-Leste, the advantage of surprise might net them Umgungundlovu, but Timor would eventually come to destroy them. Despite its apparently smaller fleet, Yemen would likely win a war against Kilwa as well, thanks to its growing air force. However, Kilwa can at least boast of having recruited the great musician Meerabai, a 16th-century Hindu saint known for her songs expressing devotion to Krishna, whom she considered her husband.</p>"

However, as you might recall, Janis Joplin died at age 27... of an opiate overdose. Guess what Kokang’s main export is?

      narration: "<p>Cambodia, meanwhile, has recruited Canaletto, or “little canal,” the nickname? pen name? of Bernardo Canal, a Venetian painter known for his landscapes. In real life he painted scenes of Venice, but Cambodia has a lot in common with Venice, so he’s probably right at home.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Yemen has recruited Madonna, one of the most famous pop singers of all time, and appears to be sending her toward Chad for a concert tour. Does Arwa al-Sulayhi realize that culture victories are turned off?</p><p></p><p>I also want to note that while Turkey’s lands appear empty, one shouldn’t be fooled. Ataturk’s tanks, infantry, mobile SAMs, and rocket artillery would make short work of Chad’s skirmishers and riflemen if they went to war, despite Chad’s superior numbers. Also, many of these units have more than 2 movement points, which means they could reach the front line quickly from anywhere in the empire. And that means that none of Turkey’s neighbors are likely to be a threat to them anytime soon.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Over in Central Asia, Turkey has surprisingly captured Sar-e-Pol—surprising not because it was hard to take or anything, but because I didn't realize the Permians still had a city in this area, so far from their remaining lands. It was obviously indefensible, but it must have held out for so long due to its remote and mountainous location. However, the notifications and minimap tell us that Sar-e-Pol wasn’t the only city to fall this turn...</p>"

      narration: "<p>That’s right, Tuva has captured Cherdyn and Turkey has taken Ekspera, which means that Kuva is the last remaining Permian city! Numerous Tuvan units, including artillery and landships, are already approaching this final holdout, and Azykay’s belated acquisition of six airplanes is unlikely to stop them. Turkey is also trying to get in on the action, but their tanks are farther away and are partially blocked by some stray troops from the Kyivan Rus’, who are currently shocked that the Permians will die before they do.</p>"

      narration: "<p>At this rate the Permians will also certainly die before Rio de la Plata, because Chile still has barely managed to put a scratch on Tucuman, thanks to Allende’s incompetent military tactics. At the same time, we’re seeing some substantial peacetime aggression from the Kayapo, who have planted a chain of citadels cutting deep into Chilean territory. Is this a harbinger of a war to come? If so, Kayapo should win easily, given that Chile’s troops are sorely outdated, while Kayapo is sporting artillery, marines, airplanes, destroyers, and other modern implements of destruction. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode28-scene27.jpg
      narration: "<p>Here’s why Brandenburg has such a high military score, even though they’re losing to Yugoslavia: it’s almost all destroyers. There are so many destroyers just chilling in the North Sea that Brandenburg can barely build any land units, and their cities are practically undefended. This fleet could easily do a lot of damage to Ireland or the Anglo-Dutch, but against Yugoslavia it’s completely useless. Frederick-William’s priorities are clearly very out of whack and he’s paying the price on the battlefield.</p>"

Shuntian is also in the black, but Wu has yet to find a melee unit to finish the job. Even so, the elimination of Ming is near, and it’s a race to the finish line for 43rd place between Yongle and Azykay.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Han has also begun a less publicized assault on North Korea, with numerous troops landing on the peninsula to attack Pyongyang. The city is taking damage, and could fall in the near future, especially if Han finishes off Ming and diverts its troops northward.</p>"

      narration: "<p>After a couple turns looking elsewhere, we return to the war in North America, and good god is it looking dire for Cree. Both Sturgeon Lake and Philadelphia are on the brink of capture, and the Cree army seems only sufficient to hold the line at Kapawe No, which is also being bombarded down to red. Otherwise, Cree troops are thin on the ground, and Arapaho is pushing forward almost uncontested. Truly a shocking turnaround for what was once considered the premier power in North America!</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode28-scene30.jpg
      narration: "<p>With one last round of artillery and the rumble of tanks, Tuva rolls into Kuva (haha that rhymes), eliminating Azykay of the Permians in 43rd place. With a frigate and a caravel in front of the city, Azykay may flip it once, but once only.</p><p></p><p>The Permians had high expectations and got off to a strong start, being ranked 6th in episode 0 and immediately climbing to first place in episode 1. Azykay expanded quickly, becoming the first civ to 5 and then 8 cities, leading to a strong production base that helped him keep the top spot through episode 7. During this time, Permian armies dispatched Khazaria, gaining a capital and relegating their southern neighbor to a single poorly developed city. The Permians were never again ranked 1st after episode 7, however, and their fortunes took a substantial blow in episode 10 when Tuva seized several cities from their eastern flank. Nevertheless, the Permians went on to capture the Massagetae capital, eliminate Vladimir, and seize several cities from Afghanistan, clawing their way back up to 8th place in the process. But just when it seemed they were back on track, the tag-team invasion from Tuva and Turkey utterly flattened them, and all of their cities were captured in just 1.5 episodes. In the end, the Permians are out in 43rd, but their impact on the game will forever outstrip their relatively low placement.</p>"

No cities have taken major damage yet, but two artillery units have set up in range of Pyongyang, and rogue Uhlans are currently sweeping away Kim’s outdated crossbowman carpet. Against Han’s vastly superior technology and production, North Korea can only hold out for so long, even if so far Wu has yet to commit his full range of military capabilities.</p>"

The Cree currently have little hope of retaking the city, as all their troops are desperately trying to hold onto Kapawe No. At the same time, the fact that Philadelphia has lost population and is in resistance indicates that that city has also flipped, dealing severe damage. It might take several turns for the Arapaho to mount a counter-counterattack and take it a second time, but I have little doubt that they will.</p>"

Although the narrator last week called the Maori forces respectable, that’s clearly not the case, as Potatau’s navy is made up mostly of galleasses, which can be destroyed in one hit by Wiradjuri’s destroyers. With numerous advanced planes and ships lined up to invade New Zealand, I fully expect this to be a slaughterfest which could even lead to an elimination. </p>"

A few units are still alive, but with no melee units in position to recapture either city, I’m confident Ming will stay dead.</p><p></p><p>Ming was a civ which did not meet expectations. Their highest ever rank was in episode 0, and their second highest was in episode 1, which should tell you something about their overall trajectory. From the very beginning they lived in the shadow of Han, founding fewer cities and failing to occupy enough of China to ever overpower their northern neighbor. Han tried to kill them many times, usually ending in failure. But over time, a city here and there was lost, until Han finally seized the capital. After that, the Inca captured Ming Hawaii, and Han declared war again to take the rest, mopping up what was left of Yongle’s empire. In the end, they will not be one of the more memorable competitors this season—an unfortunate conclusion for a civ that could in theory have been interesting.</p>"

Poundmaker is responding with an assault on the Arapaho city just offscreen to the left, but this appears to be a distraction while Pretty Nose tears through core Cree territories. Poundmaker has tried to stem the bleeding by acquiring airplanes, and he appears to have at least 7 stationed near the front line, but that’s woefully inadequate to counter the Arapaho air force, which is three times as big.</p><p></p><p>I should also note that with the capture of Philadelphia, Arapaho’s lands are finally united.

      narration: "<p>The rout of the Cree continues in this scene as Arapaho removes every single one of Poundmaker’s front line units. Ekuantshit is near surrounded, Hinenitee Toh-nooxeih-t has been recaptured (for now), and landships are staring across the empty plains at Sipiwininiwak. Remember when the Cree were a top 5 power? What were we thinking, I wonder?</p>"

      narration: "<p>Some strange borders have momentarily manifested in Japan, where Mori has somehow recaptured Miiri-Takamatsu without first retaking Miyao. It’s an admirable effort, but the Gokturks are slowly wearing Mori down, and if this continues much longer, the war could turn very suddenly.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, if North Korea declared war on Mori right now, they might even capture Miiri-Takamatsu, which would be a hilarious move for a civ that’s practically on death’s door.</p>"

      narration: "<p>It’s almost curtains for the Maori as the Wiradjuri capture Ngaruawahia, adding a second capital to their empire! Either one or two Maori cities remain, depending on whether that northernmost city (currently off screen) has fallen or not. Waitomo is also taking damage, and it doesn't look like Windradyne intends to stop until the Maori are wiped off the map completely. </p><p></p><p>As a side note, what is the city of Walla Walla doing in Australia? That’s in Washington state! That’s clearly an impostor!</p>"

      narration: "<p>Breaking news: Turkey has officially split the atom! Earlier, Turkey and Mohave completed the Manhattan Project, but now Ataturk is the first to deploy actual combat-capable nuclear weapons, with several stationed in Balanjar. One has to wonder: do any of those other stacks of planes in this scene contain nuclear weapons as well? If so, then Turkey’s astonishing rise may have taken a turn for the terrifying. Ataturk’s enemies should take note.</p>"

      narration: "<p>In an attempt to entertain the civilian population in wartime, Raoni Metuktire has completed the Sydney Opera House in Rio de Janeiro, a fitting location if I ever saw one. On some level I do love Kayapo’s insistence on building cultural wonders at any cost, even while at war. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Windradyne’s victories over the Maori have served only to distract the populace from the increasingly desperate situation on the western front, where Timorese units are poised to capture both Minyanbal and Loowee, while Gulgong is also taking damage. Timor-Leste is advancing on every front at once, and Wiradjuri’s resistance is proving ineffective. Can Timor be stopped? I personally hope they can’t, because Timor winning it all would be hilarious.</p>"

      narration: "<p>I don’t think most of us thought Tetouan would live long enough for us to see their unique unit, the Qursan, a privateer replacement which heals if it ends its turn in enemy territory with movement points remaining. It also damages adjacent enemy units and extracts gold per turn from them. With the help of a couple of frigates, Sayyida al-Hurra is using it to harass the isolated Norman city of Capua, which has been bombarded into the yellow, although we can’t ignore the fact that Robert Guiscard is apparently trying to attack Marrakech from the north as well. Fortunately for Tetouan, he doesn’t appear to have enough land units to get the job done, and naval units are still unable to reach the front lines.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The bad news continues for the Cree, as Ekuantshit has fallen to red and Arapaho landships have penetrated as far as Kawawachikamach. More Arapaho units are at the doorstep of Sipiwininiwak, including some newly developed tanks, which promise to supercharge Pretty Nose’s already impressive offensive capabilities. It might not happen this episode, but I would be shocked at this point if the Cree still controlled their own capital at the end of the war.</p>"

Tupac should manage to take it, but it’s surprisingly well-defended, and it probably won’t be as easy as he thought.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the other thing happening here is the last Maori city falling to yellow, as Windradyne races to finish them off before the episode ends.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Meanwhile, Timor-Leste has penetrated deep into Australia with the capture of Loowee, formerly one of the largest Wiradjuri cities, if not the largest, period. Doomut flipped again, but Windradyne doesn’t have much left up his sleeve; Gulgong, Minyanbal, and Kahakaharoa are all on the ropes, and Timorese destroyers are beginning to attack Maraekowhai, which is defended only by airplanes. Loowee will likely flip back, but the scale of the damage which is being done cannot be overstated. </p>"

      narration: "<p>In a terrible disappointment for everyone who craves drama, Brandenburg has managed to push Yugoslavia back from the gates of Berlin, forestalling a complete disaster, at least for now. Unfortunately for Yugoslavia fans, Frederick-William seems to have remembered how to produce land units, and for the first time in a while, Tito appears to be outnumbered. He’d best transition to holding the line and hope his offensive capability is preserved—because if he doesn’t, then he’ll never take Berlin, not now and certainly not in the future.</p>"

Kahakaharoa is surrounded and in the red, and Wiradjuri’s army is in disarray. There are no two ways about it: this is catastrophic for Windradyne, and it’s difficult to see how he could ever come back. </p>"

That said, on land, FDR is looking a little thin, and I would say he has probably missed the boat, so to speak, when it comes to attacking Arapaho. My advice for America now would be to focus outward and take on Atlantic civs like Greenland, Mali, Ireland, and Brandenburg.</p>"

      narration: "<p>In the end, we get a fourth kill after all, as the Wiradjuri capture Waitomo at the last possible moment. Potatau te Wherowhero of the Maori is eliminated in 41st place.</p><p></p><p>The Maori went into the game with uncertain expectations, as the power rankers generally thought they would put up a fight, but were skeptical that they would be major contenders. Enthusiasm briefly spiked in the early to mid game when they founded several cities on Australia, at one point controlling as many as four mainland colonies, which convinced the power rankers to raise them to 22nd place in episodes 11 and 12. But the Maori would never return to those heights, as they failed to reinforce their settlements and lost all of them to the Wiradjuri. As the Inca gobbled up the last remaining Polynesian islands, the Maori were left trapped mostly on New Zealand with no weak neighbors and no hope of expansion. They dug their own grave even deeper when Potatau gave away one of his South Island cities to the Wiradjuri in a peace treaty. After that, he simply waited for death, until Windradyne eventually brought it.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Finally, we end the episode with Timor-Leste locking down its control of Western Australia with the capture of Kahakaharoa. Maraekowhai clings on for now, but it’s practically surrounded, and only a well-timed peace treaty could forestall its loss. That means that Timor-Leste will end the episode having taken five Wiradjuri cities, most of them major, without showing any sign of slowing down. We power rankers will certainly have fun this week deciding whether Turkey should retain the top spot or if Timor-Leste should get it back. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the war is not yet over, nor are the Yugoslavia-Brandenburg war or the Arapaho invasion of the Cree, so to learn how those wars turn out, tune in again next week! I hope you enjoyed this action-packed episode, and I’ll see you around!</p><p></p><p>–Admiral Cloudberg</p>"
