      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene01.jpg
      narration: "<p>Welcome, welcome, one and all, back to Episode 26 of the Civilization Battle Royale X Season 3! Once again, I’m your host E_C_H, stills doing my dumb lil stats and history posts! When I was last here, Kilwa was being sworn to destruction (so much for that) and duckmen walked the lands, strange times.</p><p></p><p>Last episode may have been one of the most hype we’ve seen here, and I can only hope this one keeps up the pace! Just as a note, if you see an extra long writeup with a strikethrough near the end, that means I wrote up a needlessly long bit of lore/RP, and if you don’t care for that, feel free to skip to after the line. Enjoy!</p>"

      narration: "<p>Hot tip, if you ever want to reminisce a bit on the earlier days of the CBR, bring up the current Vihreaa map and the one from however far you want back, and flip between the tabs. I’ve got last episodes and episode 15’s up, man the cylinder looks better with all the empty spots filled up; while it’s also remarkable how little the Arapaho have shifted.</p>"

      narration: "<p>While I do want to give a huge shoutout to Nirosat, whose new war-wheel I reference a few time during this write-up; they got the spotlight last time so let’s rotate it with our reliable favourite: u/orangechrisy’s American Dream series! This time, we get a flavour of how Pretty Nose may be interpreting and implementing a radical definition of neutrality. Foreshadowing?</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Mohave have topped the Power Rankings for the first time, breaking the stranglehold Tuva and Turkey have had on the prime position ever since Episode 8! No doubt boosted through their impressive science showings and impressive land holdings from the Central Pacific to Honduras; let’s see if Irataba can maintain this lead or even strike against a foe to expand it further!</p>"

      narration: "<p>We begin with a shot of the scattershot Antarctic outposts that lie south of the vast Pacific, mostly occupied at this time by a Chilean squadron (perhaps of the backdoor variety?). They’re only at war with the eliminated Kwakwaka’wakw, so I doubt they’re doing much more than aimlessly drifting. Please also spare a thought for the forever homeless Yolgnu Lippa-lippa’s, who I imagine as oceanic nomads hopping from tiny island to tiny island.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene07.jpg
      narration: "<p>Staying in the southmost reaches, we gaze over the islands east of South America, ruled over by Chile and Rio de la Plata. Chile probably would have taken all of these islands if the last war had lasted longer, to my memory, and should Chile make the obviously beneficial choice to declare war again I expect they would sweep up quite quickly still. Allende was ranked pretty low in the first place due to a pacifist reputation, and although he surprised us once he really shouldn’t pass up the opportunity to impress us again, while Rio de la Plata is also facing the Inca and Kayapo.</p>"

      scene_title: "Remember the Manile! To Hell with Castile!"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene08.jpg
      narration: "<details><summary>EXTRA LORE DROPDOWN</summary><p>Tensions between America and Castile have remained tense ever since the US intervention in Burgos a number of episodes ago, and last week that boiled over into another declaration of war, this time with longer-lasting mainland intentions for the Americans. The totalitarian press apparatus run by the fascist ideologues in Washington even concocted a bogus story about a Spanish mine destroying a ship called the USS Manile (experts in the future will doubt Issabella possessing the technology to do such a thing)!</p></details><p>Whatever the reason, Leon has been brought into red very fast, with the Spanish resorting to their cultural tradition of throwing horse units into the water to slow down enemy ships (at least the Conquistador UU has bonus embarked defense, I guess?) My prediction: plenty of flips, with the victor depending on how many extra melee ships FDR is prepared to send over.</p>"

      scene_title: "Science and Sailors"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene09.jpg
      narration: "<p>I know we have some meaty war content here, but first, ding ding ding; we have our first spotted Great Scientist! For those not aware, the CBR AI pretty much always immediately pops GS’s for the science boost, making it rare to even see one, much less catch their name. However, here we spot Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, presumably quite happy to avoid the bloody frontlines, searching for an observatory to continue his groundbreaking research into the evolution of stars.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, probably more importantly for our purposes, Kokang has dealt an early blow in the partition of Indonesia, taking the large city of Cavite el Viejo in a grand display of the power of air superiority. Seriously, if you check the last episode, two turns ago the city had no damage and Yang had just 4 planes in the region. I’d imagine this is Yang’s main war aim besides the Philippines, and it will vastly improve the position for a future elimination of Cambodia. Elsewhere, it seems Battambang has emerged as the target an Indonesian counter-offensive, we’ll see how that develops.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene10.jpg
      narration: "<p>Yemen proves that they’re not going to be stopped by 1 tile of land as they land a decent force on Madagascar to take another city off of the Zulu. Operational commander Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec can take pride in his work, although his real passion is exploration, not warfare. Perhaps after this he’ll sail south and see if he can find anything new that Bengal hasn’t already settled down there (in another reality he would be lauded as a hero for discovering the Kerguelen Islands, before being fired after his second voyage revealed how useless they were).</p><p></p><p>On the topic of African campaigns, that is a fair amount of manpower Timor-Leste seems to be sending to their Zulu war. On one hand this could give them a good foothold on another continent, and Cetshwayo is certainly not a difficult opponent; but on the other hand I might question the choice to commit to this now, during a region-defining war with Indonesia.</p>"

      scene_title: "The Atlantic Wave"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene11.jpg
      narration: "<p>Unsurprisingly Leon has fallen, and holy cannoli, FDR is definitely planning on keeping it given that reinforcement wave. The pendulum has swung hard towards Castile being a one-city rump by the end of this episode, but a lucky peace or naval bungling is never out of the cards!</p>"

      scene_title: "Commie Conflict"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene12.jpg
      narration: "<p>The period of the Cylinder from the late 1800’s to the mid 1900’s saw just about every advanced state adopt a more comprehensively packaged ideological system of governance that tied together laws, socio-cultural practices and citizenship. With a global environment so focused on warfare and eternal leaders presiding over everything, ideologies that leaned authoritarian or downright totalitarian naturally led the way, and Communism, with its collective spirit and flexibility in interpretation, established itself as the dominant global order. However, that flexibility in interpretation means communist civs have zero issues finding fault in each other, and warfare is certainly not hindered between comrades; as this new joint war of the Inca and Han on Kokang demonstrates.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is a response to Yang siding with the non-Communist Timorese against Communist Indonesia under Suharto? Perhaps this is rooted in the nationalist horde government Han currently has, according to the top-left? Or perhaps this is just opportunity knocking, as Kokang has its forces mounted southward, leaving their Pacific outposts and Chinese frontier open to both civs? In any case, I expect this won’t be a walk in the park for anyone, and honestly I could see this backfiring on Wu.</p>"

      scene_title: "Yupaqui’s Voyages"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene13.jpg
      narration: "<p>From the moment he felt his existence begin on this Cylinder, Tupac Yupanqui, while certainly feeling right and happy to settle and conquer the vast highlands of the Andes region, always felt an additional yearning to spread his influence over the ocean that lay at his empire’s shores. Well, he’s certainly delivered on that desire plenty already, and with this new war he has a decent chance to expand it further, provided the Incan Pacific fleet actually heads there. </p><p></p><p>Interestingly, in spite of the Pacific setting, this is a war not just on the sea now, but the airways! Both Kokang and the Inca boast new and shiny airfields, presumably learning the early techniques of bombing and strafing targets.</p>"
    - scene_number: 14
      scene_title: "Phate of the Philippines"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene14.jpg
      narration: "<p>Once again blood is spilled across Luzon as the city of Malolos, once a grand capital city, faces siege once again. To be fair, I’m not sure which I’d rather have between the slow decade of a decades-long Medieval starve-out, or the terror of explosive bombardment and blitz attack tactics. Kokang might want to watch out that they actually have a unit to capture the city before they bomb it into total oblivion, as it seems Timor-Leste could easily end up the beneficiary if they aren’t careful.</p>"

      scene_title: "A Glorious… Revolution?"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene15.jpg
      narration: "<p>We jump to the Irish Isles, stepping back an era or two in terms of military tech. That doesn’t diminish the excitement in any way though, as William III seems keen to knock back his many detractors in the community at least a little. Plus, much like Yupanqui’s yearning for the Pacific, something just feels right about this whole ‘invade that island across from us’ idea. Of course, his government doesn’t frame this as cynical revanchism, but claims this is in fact an invited revolution by the oppressed majority Lutherans of Rotterdam and other minority Lutherans across Ireland. Furthermore, the Anglo-Dutch have put their Blue Guard riflemen and Man-of-War frigates on a pedestal, but for my money the artillery corps deserve the real recognition right now, effortlessly bombarding Wexford and Kilkenny into defeat.</p><p></p><p>Going further into Collins domain isn’t impossible but may be a bit more difficult, especially as the Irish have responded to this invasion by raising their own defensively-inclined rifleman UU in Cork, nationalists ready to fight and die for their homeland known as Fenians (well-timed, as they gain bonus strength for each defensive building when near enough to their cities).</p>"

      scene_title: "The Lizst of Priorities"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>Displeased with the bizarre lack of progress his army is currently making against Zagreb’s defenses, Freddy-W has doubled down on his Great Musician morale-boost strategy, patronizing an up-and-comer Romantic composer from the borderlands being fought over, Franz Lizst, whose astounding flood of original works and skyrocketing popularity is sure to install ‘Lizstmania’ in the troops. Now he just needs to team up with Aretha Franklin and surely Zagreb shall be in their hands!</p><p></p><p>That being said, Brandenburg would perhaps have been better served researching Dynamite based on this slide, as a look at the info spreadsheet reveals they still lack that technology, and are currently skipping ahead to Flight! Tito is taking great advantage of this for the moment, although he may want to secure some buffer troops before long.</p>"

      scene_title: "Trouble at the Cape"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene17.jpg
      narration: "<p>Down in the Southernmost reaches of Africa, Cetshweyos attempts to take back Serowe seem to have largely failed, if anything just eating up troops needed to defend against this unexpected threat from across the Indian Ocean. Of course, with 2 targets to split up attackers, the Timorese-Angolan naval attacks could fail, but with the tech disparity the chances of Nongoma or Eshowe glowing red and yellow soon isn’t hard to see.</p>"

      scene_title: "The Bay of Bengal Massacre"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene18.jpg
      narration: "<p>Historians will forever debate why such a large contingent of Pandyan frigate divisions sat at anchor in the Bay of Bengal while Afghanistan’s army swept through the cities and destroyed the civilization they served. Corruption? A traitorous Admiralty? Mutinous crews hoping to avoid a hopeless fight and fleeting death? Afghan sabotage of the communication channels? Whatever the case, the end result wasn’t pretty for these sailors, as those that didn’t stealthily steal the rowboats and flee to Bengali refugee camps were left to perish against the modern metallic warships in an infamous series of clashes off the coast of Kudiramalai. A distinctly merciless last stand for a civ so poorly performing as Pandya. </p><p></p><p>As Afghanistan pacifies and rebuilds the lands they just took, just a bit North an architect named Charles Barry has derived inspiration from the far off culture of the Normans, building a great number of palaces, gardens and even main government buildings in an ornate ‘Normanite’ style. As if that didn’t sound peaceful enough, you might want to check the minimap…</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene19.jpg
      narration: "<p>Indeed, peace is declared in Iberia! It seems Castile has seen the writing on the wall and has decided to skip the dozens of turns of whittling flips, instead just handing Leon over to the Americans at 4 pop. I suppose Isabella can take solace that she’s still doing better than her neighbor on the Costa Brava, and honestly she ought to consider declaring war even, what with the Roberts forces already grinding Tetouan down.</p>"

      scene_title: "Avenging Afghans"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene20.jpg
      narration: "<p>Fresh from their elimination of Pandya, Afghanistan’s army has marched back up to their front with the Permians, hoping to swipe back Sar-e Pol and Lashkargah. Now, the Permians do offer stronger resistance than Pandya, and probably would have even less problems if only there wasn’t a Lithuanian peacekeeping(?) force dividing their army in half. We really are getting some hallmarks of late-game CBR popping up now!</p>"

      scene_title: "Kill-kenny"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene21.jpg
      narration: "<p>Back in Europe, Kilkenny is taken without any nearby melee units to take it back and Wexford should fall next turn. If Michael aims to send a counterattack from Ireland or Scotland, he better hurry up before the orange army (not meant as a reference towards a particular set or IRL nasties, although the historical allusion is strong) organizes upwards. You may also note Tralee remaining in a perpetual state of ownership fluctuation as Greenlands navy and Irish land units ping-pong back and forth.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene22.jpg
      narration: "<p>The Muisca, far from a position of total strength, enter into the prevailing influences of the Cylinder Communist International (CCI), which I imagine to be as harmonious a body as a boxing center. I recall the last time I had the reins as narrator, Nemequene was at a peak of relevance taking on and nearly holding Central America’s capital, alongside grabbing some rogue island outposts in the Carribean. I noted then that a war was sure to begin at some point between America and the Muisca for regional naval control… boy, was I wrong. Even with the tech disparity it may be one of their best options to regain momentum at this point, relying on privateer swarms, but equally an assault on the Inca could be worth a shot. In any case, the current trajectory is a surefire pathway to the ‘meh’ section of the history books, so they better think fast.</p>"

      narration: "<p>A report back on developments in the Zulu conflicts shows that Timor-Leste has indeed split their navy, but that may not even matter in terms of conquering Eshowe! With the city at half-health and more reinforcements arriving, the possibility of a red Cape of Good Hope steadily rises, precluding Angolan or Yemeni sniping.</p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode26-scene24.jpg
      narration: "<p>Attempting to spread hope and raise morale from the balcony of government offices in Jakarta before a (justifiably) worried public, Praetor Suharto declares that Indonesia has never been at a greater stage of advancement, and has certainly entered the Modern Age! Of course, these are cheap words for those who have family trapped in Palembang, desperately seeking passage to safer areas of Indonesia before the nationalist Timorese army are marching through the city's main streets, or simply to those that fear the next target after Palembang will be Jakarta itself. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Battambang remains under siege but curiously mostly by embarked units; and Pasig takes it’s first licks also. Finally, as Nirosat’s Web of War reminded me before writing, Afghanistan is still at war with Indonesia also and actually has a navy arriving to distract and damage Suharto further, oh dear!</p>"

      narration: "<p>The notifications across the top of the screen inform that Afghanistan straight-up charged into Midnapore with the fleet we saw last slide, that’s some impressive sailing, although in retrospect a 29 defense city vs 3 destroyers is fairly bad at this point.</p><p></p><p>Here in Central Asia, they likewise have stormed back into Sar-e Pol with a fair amount of ease, although the Permians certainly have the troops to create a back and forth for a while. Still, both William III earlier and Durrani here are showing the power of a strong artillery line, it seems.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Ming have not been having the best time as of late, I don’t think anyone could deny, especially when sitting in their glorified trading post at the bottom of Japan, Kaifeng. But when the ever-boastful ‘Great Leader’ of North Korea declares that “Treasure Fleets are an abomination of capital, and the Ming should hand over all their riches to us in penance”, Yongle can’t take that lying down, and the Ming-Korean war begins!</p><p></p><p>They do have some technological advantage on their side, especially in terms of frigates vs galleys; but Juju is a big block on access and even beyond that North Korea has plenty of carpet to lay in front of Ming troops, so I could see this going slow.</p>"

So when it came time to fully define their administrative values, it was only natural for the Gokturks to follow their far-off Communist cultural cousin and raise the red flag! They should definitely start recruiting some new people’s battalions however, they are looking so much more pressed in and weaker than I expected following Han’s invasion.</p>"

It looked like they may have been in trouble for a moment last episode, but the Turkic advance has stumbled and those Murakami Kobaya caravel UU’s (quick reminder: they heal on trade routes and improvements, and get +10% strength for each land tile they border) seem to be holding up well enough with plenty of coast.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Sooooo, I’m starting to think we may all have been misunderstanding the nature of this particular war, based on that big wave of embarked units and ships Zulu observation posts are probably starting to panic about on the horizon. This is not just some accidental conflict Timor-Leste stumbled into and luckily grabbed an easy city with some spare ships; but a concerted attack on a weak link in the chain fence that is CBRX3’s Africa. Eshowe has fallen already and Nongoma looks soon to follow, albeit with some units nearby that could contest matters. The two big questions left are this: how high are Gusmao’s ambitions; and how capable is Cetshwayo of holding back the tide (a matter of production numbers and tactical ability).</p>"

With infantry landed, a sliver of health already taken and the main Indonesian fleet seemingly more focused on Battambang (which to be fair has fallen to yellow), I don’t envy the chances of the Jakarta garrison.

I know some folks enjoyed the ‘Permians rising back up’ narrative, but to me it always seemed like Tuva could crush them again whenever they wanted, as they’re doing now, so the only thing Azykay was accomplishing is securing land against my favourites for Tuva to take off him now.
