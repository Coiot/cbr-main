    narration: "<p>As a nice, soft introduction, we get a shot of Central America, or, well, South Mohave really.

    narration: "<p>Cambodia seems content to stay as a city state and just vibe with some cool tunes from the chief. They’ve made peace with the Philippines, really the only possible civ they could get a city off of, so if something drastic happens, I dare say this is as big as they’ll get.</p><p></p><p>Casting back to the last slide, Central America has also made peace with the Seminole.

For is it not the perfect subversion of expectations?</p><p>Admiral Peter Easton, for his part, has been lost at sea. He doesn’t know where he is, what he’s doing, and why his navy has left him behind to get peppered with arrows from Jeju island.</p><p>When asked about the situation, Chieftain Kim il-Sung said to our reporters that he feels ‘stable’ and ‘happy’.</p><p>When pressed on why North Korea has been the target of so much foreign aggression, the glorious leader gave out a stern look, cancelled the press conference, and ushered our journalists out of the country.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Last I’ve heard, Yemen is currently only at war with Egypt, but if al-Sulayhi  is setting her sights on Pandya, she seems to have misread some maps, and what she took for a bustling harbour city was, in fact, a small Elephant shipping yard servicing the very landlocked Korkai.</p>"

Steamed Hams they called them, a regional delicacy at that time of the year, in that part of the countryside, located entirely on the battlefield.</p>"

Asir’s chances of not being annexed (or worse) are, let’s say, ‘slim’, what with quite literally no reinforcements to be seen.</p><p>It looks like al-Sulayhi has gotten tired of the Caspian’s beaches and is now looking elsewhere for her holidays, maybe southern India.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Try as they might to expand by settling, the Kievan Rus’ is running out of space to do so. A city on the Bosporus would be excellent for them, and they do have a settler near enough to make us all mad when they don’t end up settling there.</p><p></p><p>Foreseeing that they may have to expand by other means, Olga has recruited Scotsman (or I suppose Irishman in this universe) Adam Smith, to both invent Economic theory and use it to buy some cities off of Vladimir.
