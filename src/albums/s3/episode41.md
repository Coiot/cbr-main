  narration: "<p>In the latest power rankings, Ming were able to secure a 26-point jump, thanks to being alive by technicality! They probably won’t be able to hang onto this rank for a whole episode, but it’s still fun to see this happen for the brief window it’s relevant.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Okay, onto the episode proper. We kick off the action with a shot of Timor-Leste’s core! Timor’s cities are populous, but their army is looking pretty thin in this region. It seems that almost all of the Timorese units are getting shipped directly to the front lines— particularly the borders with Afghanistan and Mali, I’d guess, as those were major meatgrinders last week.</p>"

Han has now been reduced to four cities, most of which are on the Korean Peninsula, making them very vulnerable to an invasion from Afghanistan, Mohave, or Timor-Leste. </p>"

  narration: "<p>With their conquest of Meknes and Salé, Mali is laying a strong claim to the Western Mediterranean— a claim that Turkey doesn’t seem in position to resist. Mali’s next target appears to be Tripoli, and if they don’t stumble at this hurdle, they’ll have a strong beachhead they can use to advance into the Italian Peninsula itself. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Turkey has again taken the Yemeni capital of Sana’a, thus knocking Arwa al-Sulayhi back out of the Arabian peninsula. The odds of Yemen reclaiming their former capital are unlikely, but the lack of Turkish troops in the area means that Arwa may be able to pull off another unexpected reversal of fortune. </p>"

  narration: "<p>So if they’re not in Italy, and they’re not in Arabia, where IS the Turkish army? Turns out, they’re on the Brandenburgish front. Currently, Ataturk is aiming to knock out Brandenburg’s city of Klaipeda (and thus get rid of the air force stored there), while Frederick William is sitting in the lower Baltic taking potshots at Ribe.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Dealing with Turkey is proving to be a full-time job for the Brandenburgers, though— they don’t have enough resources left over to protect the British Isles from Anglo-Dutch incursions. William III sneaks some Power Armor Infantry into England to seize Königs Wusterhausen, a settlement that cropped up after Britain’s original cities were nuked out of existence.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Ming ended last week’s episode alive, forcing the Power Rankers to acknowledge them. And the good news for Ming fans doesn’t end there— their city has restored its health to full, and their borders are not being invaded by any rival civilizations. That said, I do have to rain at least slightly on Ming’s parade: with a city strength of 42, even the fully-healed Nanjing will be a trivial snack for a Timorese or Afghan expeditionary force.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The devoted resurrectionists of Timor-Leste have given up on Chad, and are instead turning their attentions to Angola.

  narration: "<p>Closer to home, the Arapaho have sent a Biotrooper south to capture Hunza, the original capital of the Muisca. The strike force is a small one, so the Inca are highly likely to retake Hunza before much time passes; instead, it seems that Pretty Nose is just capturing the city as a middle finger shoved into the Inca’s face.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Irataba decides that trying to resist the Arapaho is futile, and instead pursues expansion by picking on a civ that’s still weaker than him— namely, Han. The Mohave seize Chongjin, and with the Han military reduced to nothing but a single Supercarrier, the city’s unlikely to flip back any time soon.</p>"

With no Brandenburger ships in sight, they just might keep it, too. It’s inspiring how, even after all this, the Anglo-Dutch are still standing. That said, a few enemy Power Armor Infantry are making their way down from Ireland, so the boys in orange aren’t out of the woods just yet.</p>"

To be fair, though, the Inca are holding the line pretty well otherwise, so an Arapaho invasion certainly isn’t becoming any easier, either.</p>"

Civs can finally make peace with one another and rebuild, as nobody was willing to continue building units and the game was drawing to a stalemate.

Mohave Biotroopers are also making their way to the front lines, seemingly more interested in conquest than defending their new homeland.

It’s a good thing, too - with a grand total of two Cybersubs for defense and no Jungle to slow down enemy invaders, the Kayapo remnants would probably fall to a stiff breeze.

Saryg-Sep is probably going to fall to the nearby Turkish Biotroopers (and if they’re unlucky, Shagonar to the Mohave), but that might be it.

Their carpet is sparse, sure, but their core cities all have a ring of troops defending them from a hypothetical invasion.

No Giant Death Robots, but there are a couple of planes or bombs around. Curiously, though, there isn’t a single naval unit to be found. Perhaps the Inca did more damage than it seems, or perhaps the Amphibious promotion on the Biotroopers is good enough.</p><p></p><p>We also have a couple of Great Musicians here! First up is Shinpei Nakayama, a Japanese songwriter famous for various children’s songs and other popular Japanese songs of the 20th century.

Christopher Tin is an acclaimed film and video game composer, perhaps best known for writing none other than Baba Yetu for Civilization IV.

Here, they’ve sniped Patna from Timor-Leste, turning things around against the top-ranked civilization in an ultimately futile but still very impressive manner. Maw Hteik is currently Afghan, too, so it seems like making peace with the Inca isn’t going to just give Timor-Leste a free run through Southeast Asia.</p>"

With practically no Arapaho units in the area to contest the region, even a few Inca units may be enough to secure this region and give the Inca another way to threaten mainland North America.

They definitely won’t be breaking through the Arapaho core any time soon, but all of Mexico could be looking significantly greener if those Arapaho troops don’t make their way down to the front lines.</p>"

That said, the Tuvan capital of Kyzyl is now within reach of the Mohave units, so there’s still some potential for something very funny to happen.</p>"

Although, does Tuva even have a chance? Unlikely, but given enough time, Afghanistan’s border is probably the hardest to defend against a full carpeted empire. It would take many strings of good luck for Tuva to reclaim their previous empire, not to mention anything more when an empire greater than the Roman Empires remains just past the Tuvan capital. The sad existence of being a minor against super empires.</p>"
