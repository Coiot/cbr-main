I want everyone to roll initiative.”</p><p></p><p>Agent Semiramis was quick on the roll as well, and the dice rewarded her in turn.</p><p></p><p>“You always go first!,” Agent Aten remarked angrily.</p><p></p><p>—--</p><p></p><p>Hans Egede loses his grip over his recent capture of Montpelier, as the war shifts from an even battle to one in Arapaho favor.

Turkey’s to the West, Tuva’s to the North, and even Kokang can pose a threat to Bengal at this point. However, if a war emerged between these two, one or the other could emerge as a minor power.</p>"

You’ve got one from the Anglo-Dutch, Greenland, and the Mohave as well.”“Oh, that doesn’t sound like too bad of an encounter,” Kwahadi smiles.“Dude, don’t say that!” Agent Aten elbows Kwahadi, as Nebuchadnezzar looks through his notes. </p>"

  narration: "<p>“Oh, you’re right! I forgot one: Tuva.” Nebuchadnezzar gets an evil grin on his face. He hadn’t planned for Tuva to join the war efforts, but sometimes inspiration comes in the heat of the moment.—--</p><p></p><p>Jalandhar is immediately knocked into red health as Tuva brings the full weight of the Uriankhai army. Not only does Tuva look to gain from this war, there’s potential for Mohave to snipe the city as well. Notably, the main forces at the Tuvan frontline are Drone UAV- I believe these units are upgrades of the Bazooka, so they can’t capture cities. For the sake of CBR, the units also have the ‘Hover’ trait.</p>"

Semiramis stands up, “Pretty Nose will walk straight into the gates of Godthab, and plant the flag of the Arapaho into the ground hard enough that people can hear the tremors all the way from Timor-Leste.”—--</p><p></p><p>Godthab falls to the Arapaho, as Pretty Nose cements herself as the world leader in conquest.

Not only is it bland, it’s rather derivative- a rump doing nothing and staying alive until the top half just to say “hey, at least I didn’t die fast” is honestly worse than a civilization that burns bright and burns out fast. There’s no charm to it. I expect better, Idi Amin.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kokang declares war on Uganda, giving us the perfect opportunity to review my own civ. It looks like there’s still some Poppy Fields hanging around. They don’t do much because there’s no City-States in this game, unfortunately, but there’s some aspects of Kokang that have come up- notably, the UA. Because of their UA, any time a trade deal with them ends, every city belonging to their trade partner goes into Anarchy. This can effectively stunt a civ’s production enough for Kokang to swoop in and take them over. However, it won’t work against someone like Han who has already built their army.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Jozef Wybicki, OTL the composer of the Polish national anthem, composes an inspiring Mazurek to the Afghan resistance. Morale increases, to the point that a brave railgun pilot drives their tank into Sheberghan and seizes the city, granting a solid opening for Afghanistan reinforcements. This… is honestly looking a lot better for Afghanistan, now.  However, I will note that the composition of Tuva’s army has changed drastically, but the overall carpet has not diminished.</p>"

One is formerly Anglo-Dutch, another is the previous capital of Castile, and then there’s Titograd- obviously belonging to Yugoslavia. Still, it’s a fitting legacy for Guiscard, that all that remains of his empire are the places he’s conquered. Poetic.</p>"

But Afghanistan was getting obliterated!” Agent Aten complains, “Why is he even allowed to play? He was hardly even a part of this game!”“Kwahadi brought snacks,” Nebuchadnezzar replies, “You know I can’t say no to his cookies.”</p><p></p><p>“Sounds like bribery,” Aten scoffs.</p><p></p><p>—--</p><p></p><p>Afghanistan, with their impressive recapture of Sheberghan, manages to push the war BACK to Jalandhar- and they’ve got plenty of reinforcements to spare. While I don’t think they can stand to push, this is definitely an impressive display- I honestly didn’t think it was possible for them to push back to Jalandhar.</p>"

Suddenly, a man dressed in military garb approaches. “Let me in.”“Idi Amin, or should I say Idiot Amin,” Wernher responds, “You’ve dug more graves than your fat ass can fill. I hope you rot in an Angolan prison cell.” Wernher says, as he locks the door behind him.</p><p></p><p>The shuttle launches clear into the night sky, as a despondent Idi Amin watches his people’s only success. Whether their colonization of the moon is successful or not, only time can tell. Still, for a fleeting moment, he was proud of what they had done- in spite of his own failures. </p>"

  narration: "<p>“Aten, as Savimbi’s forces approach Idi Amin, staring wistfully at the night sky- you are given one opportunity to speak to your former foe. What do you want to say?”Aten thinks about it for a moment. Aten wasn’t a very nice guy- in fact, that’s kind of why he was in the submarine in the first place.</p><p></p><p>“I think,” Aten says, “I finally understand him.”“What?” Semiramis looked at him, confused.“Idi Amin wasn’t trying to win. Rather, what he wanted was to hole up and hold on to whatever power he had left. He knew, if he had started marching on towards the other power, that he would have to continue a life of bloodshed that he did in the original timeline. In this, it’s just a game- but to him, it was an escape. That, I feel, is something we can all relate to. Hell, we use this game to escape who we once were on the cylinder.”Aten smiles, half-heartedly, “I hope he dies peacefully, as I jab my rapier straight through his heart.”</p><p></p><p>Semiramis, perhaps the most hateful of Aten, remained silent.</p><p></p><p>—--</p><p></p><p>Thus, Uganda is dead in 27th place. They were unimpressive, but perhaps, that was a good thing- after all, we probably don’t want Idi Amin to win. Still, they could’ve been a little more fun.</p>"

I don’t think they played bad, it’s just that someone else played better- and that’s not a bad thing at all.”Kwahadi nods, and continues “I definitely agree leaving an impact, if even for a short time, is more important than overall success. Also, do you think Gediminas would be willing to join us for our game?

Thanks for playing with me.”</p><p></p><p>There was a proud, if sad, silence over the room. No more games.Total war has been declared.</p><p></p><p>—--</p><p></p><p>From this point on, the rest of this episode is composed of reviewing the map at the start of total war. As such, my narration is going to  be fairly limited in scope as nothing new really happens. For now, enjoy this picture of Timorese colonies in South Africa.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the African island of Madagascar, we have two different civilizations occupying the landmass: Yemen, and Angola</p><p></p><p>When I was recording CGR, Yemen was actually the front-runner by the time I ended the series. I’m glad they got a chance to perform in CBRX, considering the impact they’ve left on me. That said, their performance has been rather toned down- aside from them starting the “Furthermore, Kilwa must be destroyed” coalition that brought the downfall of the Kilwa. Honestly, I feel a lot of their dynamics have centered around Kilwa.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the Horn of Africa, we see the sad, pathetic remnants of what was once Ugandan territory. They died this episode, and it feels like nothing was lost. That said, we’re very fortunate to have Angola.</p><p></p><p>Angola is weirdly unpopular, and I’m not too sure why. My best guess is because Africa was weirdly slow this season, that their victories seem relatively unimpressive compared to someone like the Boers. That said, they’ve definitely stood out as a major competitor, and their conquest of Norman Africa stands out as one of the better executed invasions this season.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mali, and their very impressive carpet, stands to gain a lot from Total War. Mainly because Angola’s core is empty. That being said, what we’ve seen from them this game has been rather lackluster- having spent a lot of the early game failing to capture Tetouan. They did end up beating the Kayapo in a war, thus gaining a South American colony, but it remains to be seen if they have the momentum to make a comeback.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Chad is one of those civs that seems impressive on paper, but never really did anything. They were a strong meme vote, and had an impressive early game, but never made use of any of the advantages they’ve gained. Now, they’re effectively toast.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Normans, or at least what remains of them. What can you say about a civ like them? They’ve been everywhere, done everything, and now stand at death’s doorstep, with their last hurrah being the elimination of Lithuania earlier this episode. Still, they were one of my early favorites, and for good reason. There’s no chance of these guys winning, but hey- it was fun while it lasted, and that’s better than most.\</p><p></p><p>Reminder that Castille is technically still alive.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Greenland, whose capital now remains in Oviedo, did better than expected of a civ starting in one of the hardest TSLs. That said, surpassing a low bar doesn’t say much. They were expansive, fairly militaristic, and even a strong thorn in Michael Collins’ side. The Arapaho, however, wiped Greenland all the way back to Europe. Hans Egede could potentially make a comeback by taking some Anglo-Dutch cities, though- if only temporarily.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch are one of the oddest performances in CBR history, I feel. They’ve never been that good, but they’ve somehow climbed to the top half through some impressive maneuvers- despite never being in the top 50%. Their conquest of Ireland was strong, they ended up founding Protestantism, and now… They’re a landing ground for Greenlandic paratroopers. God only knows what William III is planning.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brandenburg, Brandenburg, Brandenburg… I’m not personally a fan. They’ve been constantly good, but never exceptional. They humiliated themselves in war against Yugoslavia, yet somehow came on top due to a tricky peace deal. That said, they’ve never been anything BUT good, so perhaps I just find a disdain for them because they were never anything dynamic? In any case, there’s plenty of reasons to root for or against them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yugoslavia has impressed, if only for their tenacity. They’re not strong, and in fact they’ve usually been weaker than Brandenburg. Their disastrous peace treaty with Brandenburg seemed to be a decisive blow against them, but they managed to beat back the Normans. Their core mainly in Italy and Dalmatia, it remains to be seen if they can showcase one last feat.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode36-scene63.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turkey is Turkey- known for being dominant. Their conquest of the Permians and Lithuania were both displays of incredible military might, and their widespread empire has had a history of considerable performance. If anything, I’m struggling to think of what to say about them because they’re so impressive it’s hard to think of a fault with them. Good going, Ataturk.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Arabian peninsula- home to what is technically Yemen’s core. That said, they only really settled a few coastal cities here- the rest was taken up by Turkey and Afghanistan, as you can see. Still, Yemen has an impressive carpet of Battlemechs and… Great Engineers.</p>"

  scene_title: "Afghanistan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode36-scene65.jpg
  narration: "<p>If there are any Afghani Stans out there left after their considerable decline, then this slide goes out to you. They were a considerable early and mid-game power who had the unfortunate happenstance of bordering two major powers. Tuva already took them down a peg this episode, but they’ve still got a considerable amount of spunk left in them. Honestly… that sounds kind of gross.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Where once the Massagetae roamed these deserts now lie the Turkish and Tuvan empires, fated to have a historic clash. To be honest, things are majorly favoring Tuva right now, but we’ve seen in this very same episode that Tuva is not indomitable. Maybe Turkey can fend off the Tuvan carpet long enough to rebuild their armies?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode36-scene67.jpg
  narration: "<p>The former perm lands of Western Siberia! Again, a major front for Tuva and Turkey. Tuva, obviously, has topped the power rankings before, and never really fell from grace after that. However, they rested on their laurels a considerable amount, and their last-minute attempts to make gains against Afghanistan only yielded one city. Time will only tell if they can once again become the undisputed ruler of the Power Rankings.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Fittingly enough, Bengal under Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan resides in the region of Bengal. They haven’t really done much at all, turtling with less efficacy than Kayapo. Still, they hold an impressive carpet and a sizeable population- maybe they’ll finally be able to make gains against Afghanistan or Kokang.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Take a good look at those Mohave cities- they’re going to be someone else’s very soon. The Tarim Basin is going to be a major battleground, as Han, Tuva, and Afghanistan maintain cities in the region. Avi Mota is somehow the most populous city here, despite being separated from the Mohave core.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode36-scene70.jpg
  narration: "<p>Han has been very impressive throughout this game and yet doesn’t really get the love they deserve. Is it because of their loss to Kokang? Their annihilation of other beloved civilizations? No, rather, I feel it’s because there’s so many good competitors that Han doesn’t stand out quite as much. Still, keep an eye on them- they may surprise you.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Once, these islands were the stomping ground of the Mori and the Ainu. Now, they’re part of the Mohave Anarcho-Weebery Commune. Gokturk also has some claims here- and Han is right across the sea, with a sizable army in Korea.</p><p></p><p>The Gokturks get their review on this slide because their navy up there is probably the only thing they have going for them at this point. I’m not a huge fan of them, so sorry if I come off as harsh- but they really dropped the ball. Eastern Siberia was ripe for the taking, and they had so many opportunities that they let slip past. They’re going to die in total war, and few will miss them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Further south, the Han-Kokang border stands as a monument to one of Kokang’s most impressive feats- if only one of few. Still, they aren’t out of the game yet- their army is a little underwhelming but they’ve shown they can do more with less.</p>"

  scene_title: "Southeast Asia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode36-scene73.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kokang was a project designed by EmeraldRange and I, so I’m definitely biased towards them. Still, they aren’t my favorite civilization in the royale- that spot going to Timor-Leste. However, I’m happy they got into the top half of civs left, and their performance has been memorable. I particularly loved when their UA put another civ into anarchy for 12 turns. They also had marginal success in a war against Han, and fought well against a Mohave naval invasion. Godspeed, Olive Yang.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Inca, and their Polynesian colonies, are one of the most stand-out performances in the royale thus far. I love them, and judging by the popularity poll, I’m not alone. The civ usually underperforms, but now? They stand a chance of taking it all. If only they didn’t have the glaring weakness of being now adjacent to Timor-Leste, my personal favorite choice to win.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste started at the bottom, and now they’re here- with one of the greatest shots at winning. They founded the Arianism religion, with some of the strongest bonuses, and from there went on to conquer Indonesia, the Yolngu, and the Wiradjuri. They’re strong, they’re feisty, they’re fun. What else can I say?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Incan mainland settlements have grown nicely, but they don’t have much of an army. At least, not down south here- as we have seen, the Inca prefer to use their Naval strength to defeat powers such as Chile, and even taking mainland territory from the Kayapo. I’ve actually said before that I believe South America is mainly decided by two factors:1. The Amazon</p><p>2. Naval Warfare</p><p></p><p>The Inca have clearly shown the strength of Factor number 2.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While one might expect me to talk about the Kayapo here, I’m going to bring up the Muisca as a counterpoint to Inca. They had early game Naval and Military strength, and yet have still been outdone by the brute force of Kayapo’s Amazon start. They’re a good civ, they just happened to be outdone. So it goes.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Kayapo are a force to be reckoned with even after having been pushed over by the Inca and Mali. Why? Because they have population centers such as Kremoro at 94 population. Even if they fall, whoever takes control of Kremoro gets a buttload of wonders under their control. Kayapo stands to be a real kingmaker here, but who will take the crown?</p>"

They don’t have much of an empire left, but they used to be a competitor who could’ve taken it all. That said, they’ve done much better than other civilizations with their start position- Lincoln in Mark 2 was very forgettable, let’s face it.</p>"
