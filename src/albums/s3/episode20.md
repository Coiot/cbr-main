  narration: "<p>The 20th episode spectacle of the Civ Battle Royale Season Three Saga promises to continue where we left off last episode and build on the suspense, drama, anticipation and madness that has enveloped the cylinder. As your narration guide in these next 12 turns, I have a sworn duty to tour you through this album and images and perhaps make sense of everything that is happening.*</p><p></p><p>(DISCLAIMER: Narrator Bulletproof_Cookie may or may not actually cover literally everything happening on each slide, though hopes to at least do so for the most notable events.)</p>"

  narration: "<p>Move over, Vihreaa, mapmaking has a new kid on the block! Fiona has produced an excellent map, not just highlighting the cities of each empire and their names, but also highlighting the names of each civ’s government. Well done.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode20-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>ExplosiveWatermelon has made a proposal to update the war declaration icon for future seasons of the CBRX to a more Jojo meme-inspired design in the hopes that it will help narrators understand who is actually the one declaring war of the two civs.</p><p></p><p>But yeah, worth reminding all future narrators once again.. When you see the war declaration icon (the one with the two civs side by side), it is the one on the right side of the icon that is declaring the war, not the civ on the left side. Why Firaxis designed it this way is beyond me, but just treat the icon like you’re reading a manga, I guess. Backwards.</p><p></p><p>I’m not sure which is the aggressor in terms of the making peace icon, but it is also weird to me that the notification text for said icon basically reads “The civ on the bottom half of the icon has made peace with the civ on the top half of the icon”.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The power rankers have been hard pressed between whether Turkey, Cree or Tuva should be number 1 this week but ultimately went with Turkey. With that said, the Inca shouldn’t be slept on as despite being technologically inferior to one of their neighbors they’ve pushed out of their region with deeper expansion into Oceania. If they can continue their aggressiveness, I could see Tupac winning the hearts of the PR team and the number 1 spot in the coming episodes.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And with that, we immediately waste no time getting to the juicy bits of tonight’s steak as the American assault on what’s left of The Seminole civilization appears to be nearing its climax. The constant bombardment of Cuscowilla from military units in their territory is causing a population loss for Micanopy’s remaining city. With plenty of knights and ship vessels ready to storm the city, Seminole supporters may wish to prime their F keys for the inevitable.</p>"

She has reportedly been making a name for herself (and plenty of money) as a fashion designer, as well as expanding her business into handbags and perfume. It is rumored even Frederick-WIlliam II has been seen on occasion carrying around a small bottle of her Chanel No. 5 product.

  narration: "<p>East of Brandenburg, Yaroslavl falls to the Lithuanian state, where Gediminas has ordered for the captured city to be burned down. It is unknown whether it is to send a message to the people of Vladimir, because the city has deemed to be logistically and strategically useless or because Gediminas has deemed the location too cold and hopes starting a few fires will warm the surrounding climate for a possible resettlement.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The bad news is not only did they immediately lose it back to the Permians, but Oxus was also captured by Tuva, and Chorasmia looks certain to fall within a turn or two’s time. It is all coming down for Tomyris. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Across the other side of the Permian Empire, a Valdimirian Great Engineer arrives named Blaise Pascal, a mathematician and inventor of the mechanical calculator. Vsevolod opts to send him to the front lines for some reason, either to plan down a manufactory close to Suzdal or maybe because Vsevolod wants to conscript its greatest thinkers with no military training to their deaths.</p>"

  scene_title: "We Murdered A Civilization Today"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode20-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>And thus, the Seminole capital of Cuscowilla falls to America, with only a damaged Pikemen Unit what’s left of the Seminole military as it looks on with a defeated response. The remaining soldiers ask themselves “Where? Where did it all go wrong?”</p><p></p><p>Sadly for the Seminole, things literally all went wrong at the very beginning when America beat them to a forward settle of each other in the opening turns of the game, and Micanopy was never able to course correct after that. America attacked them not long after, and it was evident their poor statistics at the crucial early stages of the game were going to dampen whatever chances they had of emerging as a power. They stupidly gave away Apopka to Roosevelt after almost losing it to the fucking Commanche and never got back to 2 cities ever again aft Episode 4. They outlasted almost a dozen civs before Roosevelt finally came to finish them off and they were arguably one of the 3 or 5 worst performing civs in this entire season.</p><p></p><p>Then again, what did you expect from a civ whose starting location was Florida?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oviedo goes back into the hands of Isabllea and the Irish don’t seem to have an immediate way back into the city just yet. Instead, Irish forces start pushing to take the Greenlandic city of Christianshab, though the Castillian advance south of the British Isles could disrupt Michael’s chances.</p>"

  scene_title: "The First Ideology Of The Game"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode20-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>With the construction of factories in at least three of its cities, ideologies come into play for the first time in this game as Raoni Metuktire has chosen to adopt the Liberalism ideology for the Kayapo people. Assuming that Liberalism is just a renamed Freedom (and the tenants are exactly the same as the base game’s), it should give a bigger boost to smaller civs than the bigger ones, and given that the goal of this game is to conquer everyone else, that sounds like a recipe for disaster should  it become the world’s leading ideology.</p><p></p><p>But hey, it allows Kayapo the opportunity to grow faster and try to zoom past the tech tree quicker, so the smart get smarter, I guess.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Mali Empire’s fortunes seem to continue with the birth of a great merchant named Osei Tutu. I am assuming this is referring to Osei Kofi Tutu I who was one of the founders of the Ashanti Empire. Makes sense given the geological location of the Ashanti IRL.</p>"

Big Star, an influential American band from the 1970s, has reportedly even caught the attention of a great Cree artist, too.</p><p></p><p>There were also some rumblings of a naval skirmish between the Cree and The Mohave and an advancing army surrounding Agawesh, which caught Poundmaker by surprise.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Roosevelt was hopeful to now focus his military efforts up north, only to receive news that the Seminole Pikeman near Cuscowilla had managed to rally up a small resistance in the outskirts of the city. “Barbarians!” Roosevelt muttered to himself as he ordered several knights and ranged naval vessels to deal with the issue. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The attack on Agawesh’s city defense is in full swing, the charge being led by general El Cid (a castilian knight and warlord from Medieval Spain). Irataba has also ordered several ships to sink the Cree’s navy near Wabasca. It would appear they are not merely interested in just one undefended city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Permians have surrounded the city of Telsiai with their Unique Unit the Batyrs. It looks certain to fall and Upyte could be next on the bear’s plate.</p><p></p><p>Most of Lithuania’s forces in the screenshot are more focused in the offense against Valdimir, the latter of which is hoping the clump of composite bowmen will be enough to protect T’ver from possibly falling.</p>"

I guess not anymore (the Inca must have razed it upon capturing).</p><p></p><p>Wagga Wagga is still one of the best city names to say out loud 5 times fast. WAGGA WAGGA! WAGGA WAGGA! WAGGA WAGGA!

  narration: "<p>The Anglo-Dutch have planted a lot of defensive forts inside their territory in the hopes they will help William III keep out invaders, but Brandenburg have been planting the far superior citadels to steal territory from The Hague.

Upyte is now all alone with its best defense being the mountains by its side stunting the effectiveness of a flanked attack.</p><p></p><p>Also worth pointing out that the Vladimir capital is not at full health in this slide, meaning that Lithuania’s attack on the city itself has begun.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We now take a brief break from the madness to compare governments of the remaining civs. They may no longer have any cities, but King WIllie Seaweed still has a kingdom to rule, I guess. How one can rule a kingdom without any land, I do not know. Guess that is why they call it a Monarchy-in-Exile.</p><p></p><p>Does that also mean we as a sub have exiled Nebuchadnezzar II?

We’ll start with our Science leaders, the Kayapo Confederacy, who are midway into the Industrial Era, having already researched Romanticism, Industrialization, and Archeology. They have neglected the bottom end of the Enlightened Era tree for now, but it’s not like they currently need the extra growth or defense with their comparatively high population cities and jungle terrain.</p>"

They’ve gone for the bottom of the tree instead and have discovered Fortification.</p><p></p><p>I’m not sure why Imperialism is being highlighted since the Afghans have yet to research it, so I’m assuming the cursor was left there by accident. I do like the Weight houses for the extra gold they bring (they work similarly to Markets and Banks) and Cuirassiers are decent mounted units (you may have seen a few in Kayapo’s territory).</p>"
