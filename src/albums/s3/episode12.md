    narration: "<p>We pan barely southwards to watch a feeble war grind into nothing. As expected, the war between the Inca and Chile has been stopped by the hilly and mountainous terrain. Chile has advanced upon Quito, but adequate defenses should put them into a rout. Allende, however, thought ahead, and decided to build a large navy to bypass the mountains. Allende stopped thinking ahead when he realized that the cities he wants in this war aren’t coastal. Corihuayrachina may yet fall though.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with the last side, you can really see how much the Kayapo have been focusing on their military. Quality over quantity, I suppose, but I can’t help but feel as if they could put out a few more troops to cover their wars. They’re not exactly vulnerable due to the jungle terrain, but come on. Try harder.</p>"

The Philippines have defended their island with many ranged units, and while they did some damage, Kokang doesn’t have an overwhelming force to take it. The Philippines are also desperately hoping they could take their second city back with one spearman who must trek through a one-tile mountain pass… occupied by a ranged unit. We’ll see how their attempt goes.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Central Asia has been a heavily militarized area for the game so far. The Tuvans, Gokturks, and Han have enacted heavy conscription among their population, to varying effects in their wars. As usual, Qocho is around in the center of all of it, and not in the positive sense. They seem to keep surviving constant assaults, and taking his turn on the “Who Can Kill Qocho” challenge, Wu is sending forces in to capture Qarakhoja. The Qocho military is weak, but Sungulug Khagan has survived miracles before. He will pray in the bastion of his religion.</p>"

Unfortunately for her, the tide has turned now that there is no Tuvan front. Izhkar is back, and the Permians are preparing for an actual conquest of Oxus. The power-hungry generals want it on their terms this time, not on Azykay’s terms. But Tomyris has a trick up her sleeve: you can see on the sidebar she has made peace on the critical Ugandan and Filipino fronts. This bodes well for the war. </p><p></p><p>You can see she has a second trick up her sleeve, as she has declared a military dictatorship over her citizens. “Stay calm,” she says, “we need the troops. And if the Permians massacre our troops, we will satisfy the anarchists in our civilization.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>Due to their recent peace deal with the Philippines, we can look at Ming’s core. It looks like a typical core for this part of Asia, as Yongle has invested in his military. Unfortunately, he forgot to invest in settlers, and he only has 4 cities to call a core, with two more offscreen. He has two settlers out, but this won’t close the gap between him and the upper echelon of civs. He happens to border some of the upper echelon with the Han and Kokang. </p><p></p><p>We can also see the embarrassing failure of Mori to the north, who took the “military over migrants” route and has failed to settle enough cities to fulfill their hype of being a bombastic naval civ. To their credit, they have some ships, and that’s more navy than a landlocked civ.</p>"

While the Permians are on the verge of taking Oxus, Massagetae is poised to take it back once that happens. A scout from Kwakwaka’wakw waits nearby, seeing if he can tell Willie Seaweed to declare an opportunistic war and snipe a city. A Kyivan Rus’ scout lurks to do the same, and a trader from Vladimir wishes he could switch jobs and become a scout to take Izhkar. Tomyris also closes the crucial front with the Han to concentrate more forces on defense.</p>"

I’ve been seeing a lot of people hate on Wiradjuri, but I think they’re in a good position. Their military is formidable, and the Maori have decided that their footholds don’t really need defense, the citizens only WANT defense. Windradyne has also seen the comments, and made a few settlers because he felt sad about being bullied. You can see the one he sent towards the Maori foothold front and center, but down south he has another. Now, if he could focus his military, he could probably “settle” a Yolngu city.</p>"

Could they attack someone (that someone being the Arapaho)? Maybe, but that someone could probably muster the forces to repel the attack. Roosevelt has also sent some settlers to Chicago to make new suburbs in the tundra. In commemoration of the new suburbs, he declares the Republic of the United States of America.

They’re close to us.” asked the Darbhanga Naval Base commander. “No,” said the mayors of the cities that Bengal put right in the Indonesian core. The angry commander turned into a settler and marched north, now determined to settle a city just north of Dhaka. “How about Pandya,” the new commander of the base asked, quickly before being fired due to not seeing the mass of Pandya forces near Tirunelveli.</p>"

Unfortunately for Roosevelt, nobody is happy and the cities are now on fire. </p><p></p><p>With Scrooge McDuck still overlooking the attack, Muisca is continuing their jungle attack on Baú.

Shortly before riding into battle, he declared that his “actually strong forces” would take power. This is not a meaningless brag, because Deby has a very strong military. He also has quite a bit more: three settlers, a lot of population, and an indomitable spirit. It’s a matter of time before he spends his efforts on attacking someone again. Hopefully not Uganda, because that would quickly become a meatgrinder.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Were you wondering how many reserves the Permians had? Well, here’s your answer. If you are a fan of the Permians, you might want to look away, because their core is not defended very well. They have swordsmen to spare, which could be a decisive factor against Tomyris, but will they really be? I mean, come on, Vladimir could wipe the floor with the Permians if they got into a war. Or Tuva if they wanted a second try. But not many other civs. Speaking of Tomyris, she has decided to close yet another front and made peace with the Bengali Kingdom. </p>"

Oxus is still tantalizingly close to falling back into Permian hands and then flipping, but the Massagetae military looks just as tired as the Permian’s. Surely this would be a good time to declare a ceasefire.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of a good time to declare a ceasefire, the Han forces have still not broken the “defenses” of Qarakhoja.

Why couldn’t Mori Motonari have built a navy from his capital and attacked the North Korean coast? Why does he only have spearmen? Why can’t he just be competent for once in his life? You have a whole island to yourself, settle it before the fucking Ainu. We can see where the Ming settle from slides ago is going: probably to Japan, where they live in middle finger distance from Yoshida-Koriyama.</p>"

We have much more range than Irabata and can easily dispel that. The Arapaho military is pretty weak, but the saving grace for any attack from the Mohave is mountain ranges. Thank god for the Rockies. But the Mohave look forwards to another front, as they have plenty of settlers that they could send down to Mexico and open up new fronts. Just kidding, they could do that, but there’s only one open spot far enough from other cities they can settle. They’re still looking strong.</p>"

Irataba is also trying to take one of Modoc’s city: the Modoc capital of Captain Jack’s Stronghold.

I don’t see the other Malian settler out and about, so I can only assume it was also taken. Keita has failed so far to get his forces anywhere, and despite having not battled any forces, his frontlines look thinner than when he declared this war. To ensure that Tegdaoust will fall even if Tetouan vanishes suddenly, he also declares war on Castile. This would be a good move if Isabella had a navy.</p>"

    narration: "<p>It’s a good thing horses don’t have emotions. A lone Han horse, unfazed by the shock of Guangwu of Han being a Gokturk soldier, has wandered into Qarakhoja. The frightened citizens, including Sungulug Khagan, are bowing down to their new horse overlord. The horse plans to host military parades in the city once the news reaches Wu (the Han one, not Guangwu) and retire to a life of eating hay.</p><p></p><p>Qocho never played well this game. They sent their starting settler up to Siberia, and then used their position in mountains to hide from the consequences of their actions as long as they could. It finally caught up to them in the end, but at least they didn’t play as badly as the Comanche. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Oveido has settled firmly in Irish hands, as Collins has sunk the Castile’s navy, before hauling it to a museum and hailing it as “Ireland’s 8th Wonder”. He’s hardly faced difficulties fighting this war so far, and sunken a lot of the embarked troops Isabella decided to send out. Rumors in Dublin say that Collins is going to find another orange civ to declare war on. Yolgnu citizens are unstirred by this news.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Finally, thanks to the hubris of Raoni “Military Is Useless” Metuktire, Bau has fallen. Also a major factor was the tireless generosity of Scrooge McDuck. The Muisca are rearing for an attack on Gorotire, and taking it would be devastating, but it has even better defenses by virtue of being landlocked. Kayapo does not have better defenses because they are building wonders instead of doing anything useful.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Indonesia continues to settle sensible locations, finally surrounding Bengal’s random settle on Java entirely with Semarang. Although their stats aren’t great, their unique ability is very powerful and almost certainly helped them take out Cavite el Viejo. If they could tech up like Kilwa is doing, they could become a regional powerhouse tantamount to Timor. Cambodia and the Philippines, on the otherhand, are going to be the regional punching bags for a while. That’s a poor analogy, because punching bags are built to last for multiple punches. Cambodia and the Philippines are more like a bag filled with C4. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Turkey continues chowing down on Samandar, bringing it into the red where it can be taken next turn. This is still evident, so we turn to the northeast again, where the Permians and Massagetae are licking their wounds and readying for a future round 2. Azytak is making bombastic speeches about how Oxus contains mostly Permian citizens, even though he is wrong, and Tomyris is staying in her palace and going full-throttle on producing units to not die. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We end with a shot of two rather barren cores: those of Cree and Arapaho. Both of them have shifted their military to active fronts, leaving their flat underbelly open. However, Pretty Nose could take a chunk out of Poundmaker right now, because she isn’t even trying to fight Willie Seaweed. Out of the two, I definitely favor the Cree right now due to them having a military. Unfortunately, they just fell into a dark age. </p><p></p><p>But peace is on the continent unless you are Willie Seaweed, and I hope peace is upon you for the holiday season. I had fun narrating this episode, and I hope you enjoyed reading. Have fun vacations and wallow in there not being an episode next week. Until next time I narrate.</p>"
