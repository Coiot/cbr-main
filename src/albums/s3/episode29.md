Things are good, and we are thankfully safe and beginning to set down roots. No matter what becomes of me, I’ll never forget what you guys did for my confidence. I have a lot of who I am today to thank you guys for. Unequivocally and forever, I love you CBR and every viewer.</p><p>Enough with the sappy stuff! We got a show to watch!</p><p>As I write the intros last, I now have advanced knowledge to say that this part has some pretty hype wars declared, and some shocking cross continental empires begin to form. Let’s get in there, just after appreciating our community member for a tad longer. What? I’m sentimental gerddamnit!</p>"

As someone with some pretty hard ADHD, I get a bit anxious around so much text, but I am perfectly fine watching someone talk for an hour about a pre-built PC from the 2000s, so having our length form text content in an audio form I can splash into other game time is perfect for me.</p><p>Honorable mentions: The official CBRS3 info-sheet and all the maps.

A scary thing to fear with each war declaration each and every scene.</p><p>But enough of that, let’s spin the cylinder to our first scene around the former Platanese capital.</p>"

Perhaps Kayapo thinks there’s money to be gained by making the red south very, very green.</p><p>This war is currently Kayapo favored, helped with such a heavy navy around Catamarca in the top left of this scene and such a heavy air force based in the Buenos Aires, but this may be a long grinding assault, especially if the endless sea of ancient wooden boats flip coastal cities as Kayapo sweeps west.</p>"

Hardly a fair trade, but it’s likely the best the Cree could do in this scenario, with even their capital having taken damage the turn before it couldn’t heal fully. Regardless, it’s time for both to lick their wounds and see who’s most prepared next time, unless the Arapho want to go east or west to start a new war. It’s up to them, but if I was them I’d carpet up and secure my grip on my new Cree holdings.</p>"

Maybe a Tuvan-Afghan coalition could take them down though.Side note: Look at the city defense values. Turkish Konya has nearly double the defense of nearby Afghan Jammu. Hell, the three pop Turkish city of Lashkargah has no army defense, and still has as much defense as the defended Kabul. Being beloved does have its perks after all.</p>"
