      narration: "<p>I’m not personally a stats person. I base a lot of my judgements on Civilization strength with what I can see from their performance in-game and some personal assumptions. That said, even if you’re not a numbers nerd, I think the <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlx0YvT-6jqS78yxpGuP4RibkA5K09kCCv1UClSSPe8/edit#gid=115710568'>Stats Sheet</a> is a wonderful contribution to the game that really gets into the heart of how and why civilizations act the way they do.

      narration: "<p>Historically, Ahmad Shah was appointed king via the Loya Jirga. On the death of his predecessor, he had taken the Koh-i-Noor diamond worn on the corpse- an action that one might consider unbefitting of a ruler. Perhaps he even doubted whether he deserved being Shah, if only for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Today was different for Ahmad Shah. Afghanistan has adopted Communism. A new form of Loya Jirga convenes- one that takes the form of workers, laborers, and the petty man- to appoint Durrani as ruler once more. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind as the decision is made- his reign has shown great expansion and prosperity for the nation. Thus, Ahmad Shah had no fear about his new rule. What better coronation is there than one by the proletariat- the common citizen?</p><p></p><p>Around the conquered city of Aral, he fields his Unique Unit, the Jezailchi, in defense of his proper lands. Permian soldiers attempt to surround the former Massagetae city, and odds are looking that they’ll take the city. Not only is it heavily damaged, but there’s a squadron of units in reserve waiting to pour in. However, there’s still a chance they won’t keep it- and the Jezailchi’s strong defensive bonuses could be a deciding factor in which of these two nations gets to keep the city.</p><p></p><p>>> The Jezailchi replaces the Cavalry. It’s a ranged unit with a range of 1 tile, but it gets bonus Combat Strength on Hills and in Friendly Territory.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Let’s cover some basic details: Zagreb has a population of 25. It is the most populous Yugoslav city currently. If it falls quickly- which is certainly possible, given the damage it has taken- a lot of the population may be retained, and Brandenburg will get a strong core city. Josip Broz Tito would have to scramble his forces outside Ljubljana near Zagreb to increase his odds of holding the city.</p><p></p><p>All this, however, can be broken down into the core principle of Brandenburg’s society: the state’s borders are defined only by what it can take. Brandenburg CAN take Zagreb- it’s so wide open that it’d be a surprise if they didn’t. Whether they WILL take it is the next question.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Michael Collins is an enigma of a man, if one can even refer to ‘Immortal Rulers’ as men. Ireland’s fortunes continue to ebb, as Greenland takes the native Irish Tralee from under their noses. </p><p></p><p>What goes on through Collin’s skull? Is he really incompetent? If so, how is Ireland still prospering? Is he playing the fool simply to get other leaders to lower their guards? I don’t think there’s an answer I can muster- an immortal is very much a different entity, and their reasonings are beyond me.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Despite their vastly different origins, Shuja-ud-Din and Suharto still share some similarities. For one reason or another, they were intent to counteract the legacies set by their predecessors.</p><p></p><p>Shuja-ud-Din tore down works constructed and the order of his predecessor, and executed his former employees.</p><p></p><p>Suharto had policies set in place by Sukarno, abolished and the foundation he set for the country undone.</p><p></p><p>Within the context of the royale, both leaders contend for the island of Sumatra- both utilizing impressive land and naval forces in unison. Currently, the tides favor Suharto- however, Yogyakarta in the north is also taking significant damage from a Bengali naval siege. I’ll wait before making any judgements on who’ll emerge triumphant from this war- they both seem to be in strong positions.</p>"

      narration: "<p>In the former Ming center of Nanjing, now in Han territory, Katsushika Hokusai has appeared! They’re known for their impressive woodblock prints, including the world-famous Great Wave off of Kanagawa- a portrait that most people forget is actually about Mt. Fuji. They’ve also done paintings of waterfalls and octopi in silly and uncharacteristic settings.</p><p></p><p>Also, we get a good look at what remains of Ming, and the growingly-scary army of Kokang. If Kokang is able to take the remaining Ming cities, which are admittedly well-defended, that would open up a wide route to expansion via the distracted Han.</p>"

      narration: "<p>History twists and warps the perception of war. Despite all the bloodshed, we as observers tend to prioritize events such as this:</p><p></p><p>1916 A.D. The Great Northern Expedition of Han.</p><p></p><p>There were some initial doubts about Wu’s invasion of Gokturk lands. What may have seemed like a rash decision of an overconfident warlord… Yet, the brutality of Wu’s Horde has proven to be effective. Karabalghasun and Guzang’s defenses are quickly being chipped away, and defenses around the former have crumbled to little more than tombs and forgotten dreams. Guzang, itself, is a former Han city- and any ruler would not forget the shame of defeat if they failed to reclaim what was once rightfully theirs.</p><p></p><p>While Bumin Qaghan tries to stage a counter-offensive near Chenxian, defenses around the city hold still. It seems as though Bumin Qaghan wishes to create a separate front in order to distract the forces of Han, but in doing so has left a major hole in their Western defenses. Time will only validate one of these leaders.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Chittagong and Midnapore enter the red, but Yogyakarta also falls below half health as both sides of the Sumatran War pursue absolute dominion. Don John commands Indonesian Naval forces from within the mainland city of San Juan del Monte.</p><p></p><p>Out of all Suharto’s admirals, Don John had the most to prove. Historically, he was an illegitimate son of Charles V, and he served as Admiral during the Battle of Lepanto. However, within the Cylinder’s timeline, Don John was most well-known for inventing the staple Naval strategy of Indonesia- the Parachute Boat. By launching boats in the air using hot air balloons and slowly lowering them into nearby waters, Indonesian Naval Units were able to wrest control of both the air and sea- a strategy that would hopefully serve them well in their invasion.</p><p></p><p>However, such a legacy also meant that Don John- pride of Suharto’s navy- had a lot to bear. As enemy naval units push back against Indonesia’s flotilla near Midnapore, one wonders how he might hold up to such standards.</p>"

However, it seemed a bit overkill against the Swordsmen and Crossbows of the Platanese forces. However, as war gongs ring out throughout the city, a sense of dread hangs within Ziryab’s mind-</p><p></p><p>The Amazon has awoken with the sound of gunfire.

      narration: "<p>The Arapaho are one of those civilizations who, despite their overall strength, still manage to disappoint. Beautiful colors, expansive playstyle, and you can even see them fielding some of their UU- the Beniiinen.</p><p></p><p>However, their adoption of the tenets of Neutrality is a perfect example of why my support for them has quickly dwindled. They don’t compete- not in the way other civilizations do. They fight not with spears, nor diplomacy- their strategy instead seems to be focused around making sure the vast North American Plains are taken up by them and not a more militaristic civ.</p><p></p><p>In all honesty, I think that’s fairly important. Typically, when a militaristic civ conquers the Great Plains, they end up flooding it with units in order to beat out all other competitors by sheer numbers. Pretty Nose has made her empire into a Kingmaker- by occupying the most significant flat lands in North America, it effectively comes down to whichever Civilization will conquer the Arapaho in the end. Still, they’re putting up a decent fight, so one shouldn’t count them out yet.</p><p></p><p>>>Beniiinen - Replaces the Knight.

      narration: "<p>A Tribe called Quest is an American hip hop group. They actually inspired a separate group named ‘A Tribe called Red’, now known as ‘the Halluci Nation’, that’s composed entirely of First Nations people in Canada- so I think it’s fitting that they end up in sovereign Cree lands.</p><p></p><p>As an aside, the Bering Strait has been a contentious area. Not only was it the former stomping grounds of the Kwakwaka’wakw, it is now home to both the Gokturks and Cree, vying for who gets to paint the lands their preferred shade of blue.</p>"

      narration: "<p>My previous narration made a joke about Irataba of the Mohave being a weeb due to his historical ownership of a katana. Today, he continues the trend by employing Fuma Kotaro- a ninja under the Hojo clan- as an Admiral.

The homeland has become a warzone for Guiscard, and he has now been kicked out of Melfi by the Yugoslav forces. Tito truly lives up to his epithet, ‘the Conqueror.’</p><p></p><p>However, any further push against Robert Guiscard’s territory will likely be held back by one of the cylinder’s fiercest navies. The Mediterranean is practically more Norman Naval units than water at this point, although there’s only a smaller counterforce trying to retake Melfi. Odds are slim that the Normans are going to sustain much more of this war, but if they’re able to hold the line, they may be able to at least bear the weight of the entire Yugoslav army.</p>"

Unrelated, he shares my birthday of February 7th. </p><p></p><p>Looking at his pieces, personally, I feel they evoke a sense of ‘reconstruction’- which makes sense in the context of the cylinder’s timeline, as he observes the Afghan army retaking Aral from Permian forces. The city had flipped off-screen, but there’s still an Afghan contingent of Jezailchi to defend against the hordes of Perm- which have notably been slowed by the terrain on the western side of Aral.</p>"

Indonesia claims first blood in the Sumatran conflict, with the capture of a now 9-population city! </p><p></p><p>However, Bengal seems poised to reclaim it AND take Yogyakarta… Even still, Indonesia holds a decisive advantage south in Midnapore. If they’re able to take the island city, that’ll be a distinct advantage for their push to control all of Sumatra- and maybe even further into the mainland, as Patna seems fairly undefended.</p>"

We can see that Mecca is still under siege, with some Naval reinforcements just up North under the Active Player header, and the growth of the former Maori colonies of the Wiradjuri. </p><p></p><p>So, while a slide like this might seem like pure ‘filler’, there’s some stuff we can glean. First off, the Wiradjuri army is fairly modernized if not entirely cohesive. Second, Wiradjuri naval reinforcements are depleted- which could leave them open to an invasion by some of their northern neighbors.</p><p></p><p>Third, because the Zulus are active, it gives me a perfect time to transition into-</p>"

If you look at the geography, there’s a lot of rivers in their territory- which are a HUGE boon to Kayapo, who are able to generate food from all those tiles.

Bengal, Han, and Indonesia are all occupied, and they’ve managed to build up an impressive army within their core. Furthermore, their Navy’s not a joke anymore either- while it’s still relatively small, they’re at least defensible.

      narration: "<p>Norman leader Robert Guiscard’s heroism has attracted the attention of even foreign contemporaries. William III of the Anglo-Dutch, distraught over the defeat of Tito, surrenders Amsterdam to him. The population does not drop when given away during peace deals, so they city maintains a hefty 19 population. This… really wasn’t necessary.</p><p></p><p>To the west, the Irish reclaim Oviedo from Greenland, but the city looks to quickly flip back.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Uluru is a sacred site to the Anangu people centered in the heart of the Australian outback. Although the Wiradjuri likely didn’t share the same connection to it, they continue to take up arms to defend the holy territory. The Wiradjuri have their own holy sites, ones they wouldn’t wish to see tarnished by invasion either… </p><p></p><p>Grand Master Windradyne, known as the Crusader, leads the Wiradjuri forces in defense of Mainland Australia. Although we don’t get a good shot of that portion of the map, we do at least get to see some naval skirmishes off of the Western coast.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Yemen reclaims their former city of Jibla- citizens with Yemeni ancestry rejoice as the decadence of Arwa al-Sulayhi’s rule returns to them.</p><p></p><p>Further west, Isandlwana is hanging on by a thread. Yemen has plenty of Naval Units in order to seize the Northern Madagascar outpost, so odds are likely that this is the last time we’ll see it under Zulu control.</p><p></p><p>She also makes peace with several other nations across the map- just in case.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Han soldiers, seeing their collective action serving them well during their invasions of Gokturk cities Otuken and Guzang, realize that having people unified under a state that serves everyone equally might be the key to achieving victory. They propose this to Wu, and he ponders it for a moment… before declaring it so, that Han will adopt Communist practices under his eternal rule.</p><p></p><p>His soldiers, united as brethren, manage to fend off counter-attacks at Karabalghasun, in addition to bringing the sieges of Otuken and Guzang to near completion. The Gokturks attempt once more to push for Chenxian- and to be fair, the defenses are pretty lacking- but it might be just too late for them to make any meaningful gains during this war.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Emilio Aguinaldo was a renowned revolutionary of the Philippines. Although he might’ve pressured people to join an organization with the unfortunate acronym of ‘KKK’, he actually opposed American imperialism and denounced racial violence within the United States. He later became president of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Within the Cylinder, he conducts a survey of recent Permian conquests- such as the city of Vladimir. He seeks to join a band of forces in Southern Permian lands near the Caspian.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Sat Poro Pet is in the red- but there’s no Cree melee units within range to take the city! Dzawadi also faces a minor siege, but given the defenses around the city, I don’t think it’ll fall. Even if it does, it probably won’t remain in Gokturk hands.</p><p></p><p>The Mori have also managed to push back Gokturk’s navy, to the point where they are now the ones invading. Perhaps we can see a clever snipe?</p>"

      narration: "<p>Lashkargah falls to the Permians! It’s becoming clearer and clearer that the Permians won’t stop- they’ve got momentum behind they soldiers. Unless someone times an invasion, the Permians stand to gain a lot this episode.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Novgorod- once a sizable portion of the Kyivan Rus’ core- has now been reduced to one population as Turkey regains the city. While Olga has plenty of chances to flip the city, they’re never going to recover what’s been lost to the war. This is a disastrous blow to a Civilization that was already in a horrible position.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Isandlwana is captured and promptly razed by Yemeni forces! The city has 7 population, so it’ll probably survive the razing, but still- sacrificing that population lowers the prospects of the captured city. Yet, it can recover, but Arwa al-Sulayhi’s tendency to immolate her enemies has been noted.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Louis Ballard was a member of the Quapaw native tribe known as the father of Native American composition. He leads the Yugoslav army in a heroic march to reclaim the city of Zagreb- perhaps he’s giving an inspirational song meant to counteract the strength of Aretha Franklin’s performance?</p><p></p><p>Zagreb is already in the red, and Yugoslavia’s army is actually really well-maintained. While some might consider it weaker per person, the sheer numbers might be enough to drive back Brandenburg- although, Zagreb will be a ghost town for generations afterwards…</p>"

      narration: "<p>Afghanistan maintains their control over the island colony of Thoothukudi- and it looks like there’s no Pandya units in position to take it. Their advanced Destroyers have also brought Mannar down to half health, even with only two of them. Still, Alli Rani is committed to defending her seas from Bengal- who, might I add, isn’t invading them.</p>"

      narration: "<p>In one turn, Han manages to grab both the Gokturk capital of Otuken and the former Han city of Guzang! Chenxian has taken very little damage, and it seems Gokturk King Bumin Qaghan has moved his provisional capital to far eastern Siberia in order to better defend it. The Gokturks are losing any chance of victory, and fast.</p>"

      narration: "<p>The Cree join civilizations over the world in adopting Communism- whether it’s out of a true belief in the ideas or out a diplomatic ploy is up for debate. However, this gives us the opportunity to take a close look at their territory, and we find…</p><p></p><p>A very sparse landscape with only a few units around the capital. That’s not good-  especially since the Arapaho down south are now fielding Landships, compared to the Cree’s cavalry.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Bumin Qaghan manages to put together a counter-offensive and retake not only Guzang and Otuken, but the city of Dzawadi in the Aleutian isles as well! Furthermore, their offense around Chenxian has closed in, and the city is in red health- will the king be able to turn this around?</p><p></p><p>It’ll take some clever maneuvering, which the king hasn’t managed up until now. Let’s see if this is more than just a fluke.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Here, we can see that Dzawadi has returned to Gokturk hands. Cree ships around the city have mostly dispersed, and though it seems like reinforcements are coming, it’ll probably take them another turn before they arrive.</p><p></p><p>Incredible play, honestly! I was very critical of the Gokturks’ maneuvers as I was writing previous slides, but they’ve turned things around impressively.</p>"

      narration: "<p>Lashkargah returns to their rightful ruler, the Principality of Afghanistan, but Permian forces still remain in the area. Permians also seem to be approaching the city of Sar-e Pol with Artillery, which should allow them to siege the city in spite of its natural defenses.</p>"

      narration: "<p>We see more of Timor-Leste’s naval invasion of… nothing in particular. We can see some of their units going inland towards the very edge of the screen, but really? I’m stumped with this one. There’s a war going on to the Northeast, and instead we get to see some small struggles near Antarctica. There’s a single frigate in range of Maraekowhai</p><p></p><p>The most notable thing occurring on this slide is Novgorod being flipped off-screen.</p>"

      narration: "<p>We end the episode with a bang- Yugoslavia has managed to reclaim Zagreb from Brandenburg. Although the city might flip some more, Tito’s at least restored his territory from before the war. He also looks to be catching up to Brandenburg’s military advancements, as his army now fields some Riflemen.</p><p></p><p>Thank you everyone, I hope you enjoyed my narration- remember to show your support for the CBR through various means, the easiest being to simply subscribe to the /r/civbattleroyale on reddit!
