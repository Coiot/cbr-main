  narration: "<p>And now for the exciting conclusion of season 3 of the CBRX! The first episode of the remake wasn't kind to Ahmad Shah Durrani, who had gone from one of the few possible contenders to nearing the valhalla of shattered hopes and dreams. However, for as long as he holds an empire, no matter how decimated it has become, he will order his people to fight for the pride of Afghanistan! His men and women are able to flip back Khovu-Akshay and hope to fend off The Arapaho's advances in the northwestern lands.</p><p></p><p>A group of Turkish workers looks over his surroundings just north of Nanjing, slightly bruised from the journey to get there.

We take another look at the last image of the previous episode for whatever reason, where Pretty Nose's influence on the Americas descends south through the captures of several Incan and Timor-Leste territories.

One of them being Pretty Nose, the other, Ataturk, is banking on pushing through his many fronts in Asia, Europe and Africa. Despite the numbers disadvantage, Brandenburg is still pushing to take back as much control of the European continent.

I'm sure if you squint hard enough at the mini-map you can spot the other cities flipping between the previous two slides.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and Afghanistan nabbed back Khost a few slides back, but don't worry about it.

Despite only requiring 2730 hammers combined to complete the project, everyone gets a little carried away and goes like 20 times over the necessary amount.

  narration: "<p>In what could be the final Golden Age for the Republic of Turkey, Ataturk mulls over his options with increasing concern. The constant grappling over the same key locations with no further advancement isn't helping. The news that Benevento is his again fails to get a reaction as he gazes at his interactive world map, specifically the Indian subcontinent where his biggest enemy Timor-Leste's influence spreads into Xindu and Kandahar. The Afghan cities that were under his rule were slowly being picked up one by one by Xanana's leadership. He also noticed what was left of his army stationed around the remaining Asian territory; predominantly Artillery, with inferior air support to back up his war plans. Even Afghanistan had the better air composition in the region. </p><p></p><p>Ataturk turned his head to one of his most trustworthy advisors, leaned in and whispered...</p><p></p><p>“We are in grave trouble.”</p>"

All that he slowly built up and all the opposition he had dispatched of through the Republic's rise to become one of the few superpowers of the world stage, was now slowly being taken from him piece by piece.</p><p></p><p>“So this is what my fallen rivals felt when my might came to their doorstep...”</p><p></p><p>The Turkish core itself was now being invaded. Arys, Konya, Antalya... They were all unable to hold back Xanana's forces. Sure, those cities could perhaps be flipped back, but the neverending Total War meant Ataturk would never have a chance to rebuild his core to reinforce the crumbling nation's defenses.

Her naval forces were ordered to wrest control of all of South America's coastal cities, Rio De Janeiro being the latest to fall in line.

Aramadas of Cybersubs are stored in the Arctic Oceans when their services could be sorely needed to dispose of Brandenburg's naval power and isolate the Arctic cities of Sukkertoppen and Burlington from the rest of the empire.

The neighboring Gaziantep was unable to keep the Timor-Leste machine from moving in and needed nearby Turkish forces to rescue the urban area. Tamantarkhan seems destined to fall within the next turn or so.</p><p></p><p>And that isn't all! The European front is turning into a disaster for Ataturk as Brandenburg are owners of Cottbus and Ribe once more. Not to mention the African conflict between Turkey and Mali has become a lost cause and to quickly spoil a few slides from now, as only a garrisoned unit remains in Benevento.</p><p></p><p>Ataturk looks down and leans onto the table in front him with his arms, visibly shaken. Those who were witnesses dared not to intervene. After several moments of silence, Ataturk violently raised an arm and banged his clenched fist onto the table. He paused for a few seconds, before banging his fist into the metal surface three more times. A minute passed... Then he muttered two words.</p><p></p><p>“...

Although Kokraimoro is under their occupation once more, The Inca have brought Recife and Rio De Janeiro back into the empire. It would seem the Arapho are having difficulties converting their production and military manpower into a successful military operation that could strengthen their hand. If they cannot defeat the Incas, expand east into Brandenburg territory or efficiently finish off Afghanistan, how will they be able to stand up against a growing Timor-Leste that is gradually engulfing the old world?</p>"

Xanana Gusmao now dominates the Middle Eastern region and most of Africa.</p><p></p><p>... Is it safe to assume everyone who is reading knows how this is ending now? Is there any doubt as to who ultimately will be this season's winner?</p><p></p><p>Yeah, I think I am going to reveal it right here, because the rest of the episode is really just all the dominoes falling down now. If you're still reading, it's to follow the rest of the journey before the final destination and see in which order the remaining civs fall. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, led by Xanana Gusmao, has reached a state where they are hands down the strongest civilization left and none of the other empires are able to compete for the winner's prize. It is no longer a question of if Timor-Leste can win this season's Civ Battle Royale, it's how soon.</p>"

They then failed to make any major plays until total war arrived.</p><p></p><p>And that was when Afghanistan showcased its true might.

They started their run by harassing Tetouan at the cost of hurting their stats and opening the door for Yugoslavia to forward settle them.

By the late-game, Mali was able to control Iberia and most of North Africa and held its own in Total War against the superpowers such as Turkey and Timor-Leste. They outlasted Angola and while they weren't able to join the elite five in terms of influence, they still held their own despite not having completed the tech tree so late into the season.

  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste finishes his turn, and with it, both Brandenburg and Turkey forfeit their remaining cities (those being Essen, Eberswalde and Anyksciai). I'm assuming Brandenburg's cities fell first because they're both listed as being captured before Turkey's, but even if it's the other way round, I'm personally placing Turkey after Brandenburg in the elimination order on the grounds that Turkey deserves the higher placement.</p><p></p><p>Turkey didn't have the lofty expectations that other civs had pregame, but their position heading in was considered good, with the Power Rankers placing them at 16. When it came time for the actual game, Ataturk did not let anyone down. Normally, the civ that makes the first elimination doesn't reach superpower status, but Turkey bucked the trend by killing Assyria and not letting the subsequent warmonger penalty rip them to bits in the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>From there, Turkey's aggressiveness would make them one of the strongest empires for the rest of the game. They would finally make their big move when they teamed with Tuva to invade Perm, then rumped Lithuania. When Total War dawned, Turkey would continue to unleash hell by expanding into Europe and North Africa before outright dismantling Tuva. The spread of their empire made them arguably the most feared civ in the game... Until Timor-Leste took that title. They came so close but were unable to make critical advancements during the remake and were punished severely this episode for it.</p><p></p><p>I would have loved to have seen Turkey win it all and was rooting for them, but they will have to settle for 3rd place (4th if you count Castile, which honestly I don't). In terms of overall performance, I would consider Turkey this season's true runner-up. You may now rest.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brandenburg, however, were absolutely nowhere near as strong as their finishing place suggests. They basically lucked out that all their European neighbors sans Turkey were either awful, bottled hard or had stretches of poor form during this season. While certainly not as big of a disappointment as, say, Rio De La Plata were, we were all expecting a lot more from the number 2 ranked civ preseason than just being one of the last to die. </p><p></p><p>They started off great by settling Scandinavia (though that's more on the Angola-Norse being horrid at settling the area) and grabbing some arctic settlements, as well as slowly conquering the Anglo-Norse... And that was it. They stagnated in the mid-game and made zero expansion, only doing so by (at best) dumb luck. They were fortunate that by this stage, Ireland was useless and the Angola-Dutch didn't wake up until it was too late to make themselves a contender. They were embarrassed by Yugoslavia at one point and almost lost Berlin, but ended up turning a net profit thanks to Tito bottling the war and ceding one of their own cities in the process. Lithuania were their biggest neighbor for a long time and never made a major attempt at invading Brandenburg, either.</p><p></p><p>So Brandenburg lasted as long as it did because their neighbors were all somehow even worse. When Total War broke out, they somehow lose their capital to the Angola-Dutch before losing half of their land to a true superpower in Turkey. They were never in the same league as the elite or even near elite powers. Brandenburg did show some fight in the remake, but it helped the Arapaho and the Inca mostly ignored them and the only other distraction was Mali. They may have finished in the top 5, but I wouldn't even have them in the top 15. Bye-bye, Freddy!</p>"

In its aftermath, Frederikshab, along with Pretty Nose, were blasted away into smithereens like a Dragonball villain in the climax of a final battle. Half of the once Arapaho core had now vanished.</p><p></p><p>The Arapaho were ranked 3rd by the PR team before episode 0, but there were concerns that they would disappoint. Who knows if they would have had The Comanche actually played seriously, but their refusal to settle their second city gave Pretty Nose valuable time to settle their area and kill them afterwards. There was then a large amount of game time where the Arapaho were vulnerable to a three-way attack against the other three North American powers, but fortunately the three were busy fighting elsewhere. This gave the Arapaho a chance to build up and challenge each of them one by one, starting with America, then the Cree, and finally the Mohave. They emerged as the North American superpower and gained a foothold in Asia. Although they tried to make the most of their situation in the remake against the Inca, Afghanistan and Timor-Leste, they couldn't strengthen themselves any further and once Timor-Leste invaded North America, that was all she wrote.</p><p></p><p>Pretty Nose finishes in second place overall or third place depending on whether you consider Castile the runner-up.

He had heard something about a force field protecting the frozen fortress and wondered what that meant. He had seen enough. He did not wish to intervene more than what was necessary, but it was time for answers. Neb gave the order to open up communications. He demanded to hear from Isabella.</p><p></p><p>“ENOUGH! Isabella, you are to answer immediately and explain to me what this charade is!”</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence passed, before he received an answer from Isabella herself.</p><p></p><p>“Ah, if it isn't the secret 62nd civilization of this world. Nebuchadnezzar, am I correct?”</p><p></p><p>“Explain yourself! Castile was supposed to fall ages ago when the Normans finished you off. Yet you somehow survived, teleported to us, resettled Burgos on the surrounding snow mass and have avoided capitulation from the remaining civs. Not even Timor-Leste can take the city! I demand an answer now!”</p><p></p><p>Isabella firmly replied back to the Babylonian leader. “You demand an answer? Fine. I am not going into elaborate detail now, but to make a long story short, our science is a lot more advanced than you were led to believe. Our scientists had secretly developed advanced satellites and radars that picked up the coordinates to your submarine back when most of the 62 civs were still around. We sent our best spy to investigate your vessel. They infiltrated your defenses and managed to steal vital intel and technology which our scientists studied. Just as our final city was about to be captured, I and numerous others secretly escorted ourselves to the snowy lands surrounding your vessel. When we arrived, we settled there both to secure our survival and also to study you further.”</p>"
