  narration: "<p>Greetings all to the first episode of the remake, the world has been remade as best as Lunar could do in a smaller map with the unit issues fixed, the civs trapped in total war, and the leaders apparently replaced after the whole escape thing from last episode. Finally the sounds of war march once more, and the world will be set ablaze. I’m Orange, aka u/Orangechrisy, the one who makes the polandball comics (though I invite others to do the same so I don’t have to say “the one” anymore). I did not follow what I said in my previous introduction of finding a therapist again, but it just be like that sometimes. Just gotta rawdog mental illness, maybe not the best idea, but that doesn’t matter for now because we got an episode full of action (I sure hope) and joy (probably for some people at least) (please Mohave you can do it…), and you’re all now stuck here on this journey with me. So I hope you enjoy the narration and the show!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Okay apparently I did use “so fly” as a rhyme for the Ko-Fi slide when I did Episode 5, but like that was ages ago so no one else remembers it so I should be safe to get away with it, right? Yeah. Anyways thanks to these people for donating to help make it easier to run the game! </p>"

  narration: "<p>Isabelle of the frozen Burgos, the unholy city of snow, decides that Fascism is needed moving forwards. Whether this is to keep up appearances or because she believes they really are a superior people for living in Antarctica, we may never know. Either way, the city remains isolated from the world, surrounded by ice, almost impossible to take. May it love on in eternity.</p><p></p><p>The year is 2040AD, also known by the sub’s calendar as turn 480, life begins, it probably won’t last that long. Let the fighting continue!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Qaghon sits on another icy throne, on the opposite end of the world to Burgos, contemplating what’s happening. Brought into this world he finds himself already on the brink of death, and seemingly much closer than any Gokturk before him. What was his purpose? Did it even matter that he was brought into this world if he was just meant to die? These are the thoughts that weigh on the Khan as he hopes that the Arapaho are kind to him in his defeat.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yeah so the World Congress forgot to be turned off in the remake, so we have a little bit of that. It of course is still fine in the grand scheme of things, just its a bit annoying for Lacs to have to deal with running the game (though that is over so it’s all good now).</p><p></p><p>Also it should be noted, as the previous slide indicated, the remake is total war all the time, there is no peace for our competitors, only war, blood, and machines, and maybe, just maybe, a little bit of gay war angst. Though now that I’ve said it I now have to write that at some later point… </p>"

  narration: "<p>Pretti Nose declares that they need a new religion in the Arapaho lands, and decides on Catholicism as the religion of choice. I choose to believe it still has the Nationalism Animals pantheon, a girl can dream.</p><p></p><p>This shot also gives us a better shot at the Arapaho core, the unit density is so much better than previously, and they are definitely in a good position to use that military to conquer a lot of lands.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yuupanqui, seeing Arapaho found Catholicism, decides he needs a religion of his own. His advisors rejected his proposal of naming it “The Killuminati”, so he instead went with their choice. “So much lamer, completely uncool and boring” he thought to himself as he dejectedly went back to having millions of lives under his command.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode46-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>2 turns into the remake, the Gokturks find themselves dead. They honestly survived way way too long into total war, it’s kind of a miracle. They started off strong but just never really found a good footing, rarely declaring wars and struggling against Han. But they survived longer, all the way to 12th place. So who’s laughing now Wu? WHO’S LAUGHING NOW?</p>"

  narration: "<p>I lied there’s not really any terror going on here. A few ships are harassing Atauro, but like, neither side has that much, especially in the way of ships. But while Afghanistan tries to take Atauro, it seems T-L is trying to take Sau13kanuary, 2041 AD (Turn: 482). Kind of a weird thing to name a city, I gotta say, but hey I don’t judge. Good luck Timor though I’m rooting for you.</p>"

I feel like Timor-Leste has the advantage in the South Indian Ocean, but you never know. Maybe Ahmed Durrani is preparing something secret to take it all back, but it seems unlikely. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Turkey jumps down the east coast of Africa, taking two cities off of Timor-Leste, one city off Yemen, and even one off Afghanistan in Arabia. Maybe Ateturk should have prepared a bit better for this conquest, as none of the gains on the coast at least seem tenable. Yemen already recaptured Isandlwana, and Timor looks to surround Kilwa Kisiwani and Mbarara.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Pretti Nose sends a task force right into the middle of the northern German empire, right to Baltimore. Now they also sent a number of troops to Sukkertoppen (and hey if there’s anything I’ve learned this past week it’s that tops do need some suckin’), so maybe they will be successful in this assault. It would be very nice for Brandenburg to start losing these lands.</p><p></p><p>Also Turkey just has a bunch of units/ships in the North Sea for some reason, maybe they will do something, who knows.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ignore what is said at the top of the screen, that’s a surprise tool that’ll help us later (aka next slide), but for now we just get to witness the Incan attack on the Arapaho Caribbean. They look to have the numbers advantage, and Fusagasuga is down to yellow, but they have like no planes at all, and the planes Arapaho have are beating down on Qalla Q’asa, Hunza, and Kokraimoro. Yuupanqui is gonna have to hope this invasion goes quick before the planes turn things around.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turkey isn’t the one to take Isandlwana, instead it’s Afghanistan! For some reason Ahmed decided that that’s the best way forward. It’s a capital, sure, but it’s completely undefendable, so that’s just wasting a unit really.</p><p></p><p>Also Mali manages to capture Sugamuxi, one of Kayapo’s remaining cities. Maybe next time we see Kayapo cities taken it’ll be when they are dead.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On the other side of the Arapaho-Inca front, Arapaho is sending a massive army against Guiyang, Aha Kwahwat, and Selye’aya-ita. Like, damn, that is a massive army. I don’t see much hope in Inca keeping any of those cities tbh. Maybe us rankers putting Inca first was a mistake…</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode46-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>We get another shot of Afghan Half-Of-Madagascar, and it really shows how bad of a position Yemen is in. Already down to 2 cities, with another about to fall in the next turn. Al-Sulayi must be praying to her not-as-of-yet-decided god or gods that she can make it out of this alive. She won’t of course, but maybe it’ll buy her a few more turns.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Taizz is retaken (though likely to fall again soon), and Mazar-I-Sharif is taking some hits. For now it seems Turkey has the upper hand, but if Afghanistan can bring some of those units in southern/eastern India over then they can contest things pretty well. </p>"

  scene_title: "Manchurian Candidates"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode46-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The northeast coast of Asia is once again up in flames, just like last time. The battle between four separate powers, or well, three powers and Mohave but I for one will still consider them a power. Arapaho has the most units in the area and is trying to attack Turkey, but Turkey has the second most and can likely defend it. Afghanistan has very few in the area, and Mohave has most of their forces around (which is very not much). This will likely be a bit of a slog.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If I was a betting man, and to be clear I don’t bet nor am I a man, but if I was, then I’d still bet that Inca would hold Recife. But you have to admit it’d be really funny if Mali took Recife again like they did against the Kayapo and kept it. Like, that’d be really really funny. So let’s hope it happens.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Fozzy’s heard from his friend that it’s not easy being green. But over here in the Pacific, the opposite may be true. The Incans have gathered quite a large naval force to push into Timor lands and already have taken Wagga Wagga. Timor really needs to build some more ships if they want to defend against this onslaught. But they should also maybe prepare some nice remarks about Tupac, just Incase they don’t... Wocka wocka. </p><p></p><p>Get it, in case, Inca-se. Good one me, great job. Keep it up.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We get the full view of Timor-Leste taking Saungkang off of Afghanistan, and Ahmed doesn’t seem to have enough to really put enough pressure on the city to secure it again. But not just that, we also get Guzmao taking Hlobane, Isandlwana, Kilwa Kisiwani, Sofala, Mbarara, and Kampala. Absolutely massive turn, I assume the next slide will show those sweet sweet African gains.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And with that, Yemen is dead. Timor-Leste has swept up the last of their holdings, their last ditch to stay alive. But down it goes, subsumed into the red and yellow machine. The one true ruler of the Indian ocean will be Guzmao, and none can stop him. Arwa al-Sulayi gets sent back to the sub, crying into her hands, weeping for the empire that never was, weeping for a time when Yemen had hope, and power, a time never to be seen again.</p><p></p><p>Yemen was honestly really great this game, the fact that they managed to get so much science put them quite ahead of most of their neighbors, but alas they couldn’t put that advantage to enough use. Turkey took most of Arabia before Yemen could settle or take it, which really set them back, and they failed to attack others when they needed to, or when Turkey was weak. They spent much of the game occasionally picking at Kilwa rather than properly sweeping them and then taking on Pandya, Uganda, and Afghanistan. They had a lot of potential throughout this game, but just couldn’t put it to use. Rip in 11th.</p>"

  scene_title: "Arapaho Assault"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode46-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite the large Incan presence in the east, Arapaho bursts through, taking Tiwanaku and Kokraimoro from the wealth of Incan units. I’m gonna be honest, things are feeling not great for Inca, my ranking dashed against the iron rocks of Arapaho’s guns. It’s unlikely that they will hold these cities, but it really shows how faltering the Incan lines are. </p>"

  scene_title: "Stepping North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode46-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste, with their superior navy, or really just a navy, moves into the southern Malian coast and nabs Wagadou right from under Kaita’s nose. Mali is still focused on taking Benevento and Sarh from Turkey, which to be fair it seems they will probably succeed at, but it means they’ve built no navy so is just bleeding to Timor-Leste in the south and Inca in the west.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Other Navy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode46-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timor-Leste has a good navy on the other side of their empire as well, managing to take two cities off the Inca and splitting Aotearoa once more. They also have 72 planes compared to the only 12 Incan planes that I can see. Those planes have done a good job at chipping down 4 cities to black, Waitomo, Puk19wa, Piro3gia, and Eug-24ra. I feel it won’t be long until more fall.</p>"

  narration: "<p>CALL IT BACK, REVERT COURSE! RETRACT THE EULOGY! QUICK QUICK! Ahem, *cough cough*, things are fine, fine. Okay, yes, Arwa al-Sulayi has clawed herself back to life, against what I had thought. Now, they won’t last beyond this turn it seems, they have a single robot infantry guy and a settler. But alas, they are alive yet again, so I will have to write a new eulogy next time we see the Yemenless husk of Madagascar.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Edit from me in 25 slides: I did not do a second eulogy, I forgot about it immediately after going to the next slide. The joke was going to be me just copy pasting the previous eulogy again so pretend I did that in about 5 slides when the minimap shows them dying again, and then like laugh really hard cause it was a good joke that you appreciated and found hilarious, thanks <3.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Afghanistan and Turkey flip around a few cities, or more-so Turkey pushes all the way up to Herat and Mazar-I-Sharif and Afghanistan pushes back a little bit. So maybe it’s less criss cross and more just a slide to the right with a little take it back now y’all or reverse reverse. </p><p></p><p>Ahmed also takes that random Antarctic city again for some reason bro just take like a city near your other cities so you can actually have a chance at keeping it.  </p>"

They continue to march south.</p><p></p><p>“The Incans aren’t putting up much of a fight,” Biscéíh said, putting down the hyper-binoculars. </p><p>“Hey they defended Mexico for three years, that’s better than some,” her partner responded. “Gotta give them credit for that.”</p><p>“Uuuuaaaah,” she loudly sighed. “It feels like it’s only been about 25.”</p><p>Ceneetéénii'ehísei paused from her comptroller screen and looked at Biscéíh, “25? 25 what?”</p><p>“I don’t know how to explain it, it’s just, 25.”</p><p>“That means nothing, you’re not making any sense. Let’s get back to work.”</p><p>“C’mon you know these automatons do all the work themselves, we’re just sitting on the sidelines.” Biscéíh leaned back to lie down.</p><p>“We have an important job, we have to keep watch to make sure these bots don’t malfunction.”</p><p>“But it’s sooo boring!”</p><p>Ceneetéénii'ehísei turned to face her partner again and in a stern voice questioned “Do you want to die on the frontlines?”</p><p>“I-No. But you get what I’m saying right?”</p><p>“I don’t. I’d rather have you next to me alive then turned into a paste by one of their biotroopers or terminators,” said Ceneetéénii'ehísei matter-of-factly. </p><p>Biscéíh suddenly teared up a bit, “You’re too kind to me, what’d I do to deserve you?”</p><p>“Besides being as pretty as Pretti Nose?”</p><p>“Your compliments are too much,” she said, lightly batting Ceneetéénii'ehísei’s face. “But really, it feels like I haven’t done anything, we’ve just always been together.”</p><p>“Are you talking time nonsense again?”</p><p>“What? No! …Maybe,” she said sheepishly. “Look, you have to admit it’s weird right? As if everything past a few years ago is in a haze.”</p><p>“Yep, on your time nonsense again,” she concluded. “C’mon get back on task, we still have a job to do.”  Ceneetéénii'ehísei brought them back on track, though she couldn’t quite shake what her partner said from the back of her mind. It was a bit hazy, but Biscéíh was speaking nonsense, they definitely had a history past three years ago, she definitely lived it, right?</p>"

Turkey really just isn’t putting up a fight for their African lands, which I for one am happy about, I think Turkey’s kinda just had a walk in the park this game, so it’s just so nice to see Mali beat them.

We don’t know how a singular dinosaur has breached the city limits, and many are looking to the government for answers. But since they haven’t commented yet we turn to the people for answers.</p><p>Camera pan as Varela holds out the microphone</p><p>“Excuse me citizen, what are your thoughts on-”</p><p>“AHHHHHH! IT’S COMING!”</p><p>Camera pans back to Varela, shaking every few seconds</p><p>“The terror in his eyes. This is what the government is letting stand by not responding immediately with help.”</p><p>A roar is heard</p><p>“Can we be sure that this is an Incan dinosaur?

They had a busted start with their uniques and position, making it incredibly hard to attack them and giving them huge amounts of population and science super early on. Then they just did so little with that, like, they fought Brazil? That was their biggest thing for a while, and Brazil was weak af. Then they fought RDLP who was similarly super weak compared to the way too teched up Kayapo. The first time they had a proper war with the Inca they lost despite the Inca being weaker as well, just still strong enough to be an actual fighter rather than just a pushover at the bottom of the board. Though my favorite moment was when the much weaker Malians took Recife and kept it after peace, that was fucking hilarious. Kayapo the entire game was just “turtle up to be powerful later” and then not doing enough to go through with the “be powerful later” part. Glad I, the resident Kayapo hater, can be the one to send them off so I can influence everyone’s final perceptions of them. Rest in all the pieces Metucktire, I laugh at your demise.</p>"

Maybe if the Timorese people look back to this time in history they will see pages and pages dedicated to the brave maneuvers of Captain Cirrus and the fantastical assault she led in the South Pacific. Maybe they’ll also see a funny video of a guy named T.V. get eaten by a T-Rex after being an idiot with zero surrounding awareness, and then click instead to a better video detailing Cirrus’ exploits with well animated graphics and professional voice-over rather than clown music over a dumb news man. </p>"

More concerning for the Inca, as I think I’ve mentioned sometime earlier I forget it’s a new day and I don’t get enough sleep ever, is that the Inca do not have enough planes.

Each painting’s description does not describe the painting themselves, but of guns, bombs, mechs, and other weapons of war, along with someone they killed, and who that person was, their ideas, dreams, job, family. A sobering experience to anyone entering the exhibit, yet to those who have lived through the hell of the Arapaho warmachine find it indescribable, a visual of their deepest pains and traumas. To the common person, the exhibit is free, showing what they all have experienced, but to the rich, the politicians, the foreigners (the poors can’t travel of course), they all have to pay a hefty fee. They have to pay for the horrors of what they get to avoid, of what they don’t have to experience, because there’s no other way to force them to suffer in the same way, Van Gogh can’t pick who has to fight, all he can do is present the horror of it all, and maybe, hopefully, get them to change just a little bit. </p>"

Mohave really did do way better than anyone thought they ever could. Nearly every single test they sent their settler to Central Asia and were so incredibly weak and just got rolled over. But this run, the true run, they fought their way through, still settled Central Asia, dominated the coast, marched into Japan as a true weeb, made an actual decent sized colony out of Central Asia during total war, and let me draw them with the Miku hair. Damn they played a good game. Yet I still think they deserved higher, first maybe, of course, but more realistically they should be getting 5th, or 4th. Pour one out for the greatest. Bless the sub and bless the heavens, bless the world with Mohave’s presence. It’s all downhill from here.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sun Ra, the legendary jazz artist who escaped the carnage at Kamahnulya, writes his last piece. His melodic piano and driving synth sounds give a soundtrack to the end of the world for the last of the Mohave, a somber tale and somber tune. Beats that give the people a little bit of support in the wake of their end, the fallout in the hours, days, weeks, and months after the fall. Sun Ra wouldn’t be able to escape the mechanisms of the Arapaho, following the same fate as so many of his fellow Mohave. But his music would live on, bringing hope to those who would survive, to those who were now under the thumb of a new government.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Across the world in West Africa, Mali had actually managed to take back Kangaba and even Tegdaoust a turn or two ago, but now are facing the Incans taking both back and even taking Fez. The Incans may be losing in their west, but they are winning on this front. More importantly is that Mali finally took Bari and has secured those Med cities they lost so many slides ago. It’s not really more important, but it’s finally over geez they should’ve done that ages ago. Now they gotta go push out the Incans again.</p>"

  narration: "<p>There’s a large build up of units in the Middle East, will it be enough? Who knows… Anyways this slide shows Turkey taking back a city from Brandenburg and Arapaho, but the slide minimaps missed Timor-Leste pushing all the way to Kandahar, which Turkey takes back. But Ateturk doesn’t take back Sarh and Sana’a which were also taken. Maybe Thebes will fall to Timor-Leste before Mali, it's feeling more likely… </p>"

  narration: "<p>To go back to the boring front for some reason where Turkey took back one city, Erg-34kon, but are likely going to lose it soon. They also keep fighting Afghanistan over Khovu-Aksy, but are yet to touch Avi Mota yet. Y’know, from the start of this episode, you wouldn’t have expected Afghanistan to be down to 8 cities in China, stuck between three much much greater powers. </p>"

  narration: "<p>We also get a shot of the other city Turkey took back, Klaipeda. Not sure why we are getting these when we could look at how Timor-Leste took four cities from the Incans and are now in the Galapagos. (Sidenote I finally looked it up cause the doc keeps getting mad about it, apparently it is not “Incans” but just “Incas”, and I’ve been getting that wrong this whole time and I’m not gonna go change it so sucks for those of you who are pedantic about that spelling. I wonder if I got this wrong in my previous narrations too or not?) Anyways, Brandenburg really is trying to push on London but is just failing, their big army is just doing nothing. I suspect the complete lack of planes compared to Turkey’s many many planes. But y’know, props to Fredrick Willy for managing to go even with Turkey this entire war, though I will say Mali has gone fairly even with Turkey but also did it so much more excitingly. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Burgos has been shelled for years now, and a massive Incan army has set up around the city. Yet, because of the world, they can’t do anything. The ice protects them, there’s no way in. They haven’t figured out how to paradrop. Isabelle lives on another year, another episode. Forever shall they stand in their icy home, in safety from the world (ignoring the bombs). Though sadly we won’t get to have the nice narrative conclusion of ending where we started here in Burgos because there is one more slide…</p>"

  narration: "<p>We end this glorious episode with the Arapaho war machine coming into conflict with the Timor-Leste war machine. Guzmao really has put himself on top of the world, can he be stopped? I don’t know, we’ll have to find out next week. For now, the clash of metal crushes the lives of all they pass by. Bullets sing and the flow of blood shows no end. </p><p></p><p>Thank you all for reading, I hope you enjoyed what I wrote, got all the reference, and I’ll be back for narration for mkx4 (hopefully Episode 5 again to keep the streak going). This game is almost over, I’m hoping Timor-Leste takes the crown, that would be the greatest of ironies, the greatest possible upset. I’ve been Orange, and since it’s 10:30pm here, こんばんわ！(If you can read that you’re a fucking weeb)</p>"
