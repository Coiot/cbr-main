      narration: "<p>Hello everyone and welcome to the Civ Battle Royale X Season 3 Episode 22. </p><p></p><p>Your narrator for today is BV (or anarcho-balkan on reddit), aka the concept of being annoying made flesh. You may remember my narrations of ep 18 of s2 and ep 7 of s3, as well as from other stuff you can read in the opening slides of those (I’m not gonna bore you with the same details over and over again). </p><p></p><p>And since Nirosat didn’t want to elaborate on the coinflip, I’m gonna respect his wishes and… not elaborate. Hope there’s no hard feelings, Niro. </p>"

      narration: "<p>By the time I’m typing this (11th March), there is no OC, but since Orange is always there with her American Dreams series, I’m thinking of already calling it here that that’s gonna be on the slide and that it’s very good, as it always is. Really looking forward to what she has for us this week. </p><p></p><p>EDIT (14th March): She delivered. Mohave is approaching menacingly towards Central America. Also congrats to the Pacific Ocean for coming as an bisexual!</p>"

      narration: "<p>The first in the power rankings this week is Tuva, with Turkey a close second, but here I wanna focus on a different civ, namely Rio de la Plata. They had the largest change in ranking from the previous PRs, rising 6 spots. The screenshot shows us an event in the CBRX that gives us a small, blurred view into an alternate timeline, the RDLP much closer to living up to its Episode 0 top ranking. Ultimately, given their small size and outdated tech, here they will never reach those heights, but as much as I prefer the Inca over RDLP, I have to admit it’s nice to see a glimpse of what could’ve been. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Into the action we go. </p><p></p><p>Here we see American troops approaching Windsor. </p><p></p><p>Honestly, since I forgot America was among the gaggle of civs that DOW’d Vermont last episode, I was confused if this was a war or some open borders shenanigans, but then I noticed that several of the American units have sustained damage, so - war it is. I guess a better indication that it’s a war probably would’ve been that Vermont doesn’t have what was by their standards a unit carpet anymore. That Vermont fact was somehow more memorable to me. I guess the fact Windsor is undamaged threw me off. </p><p> </p><p>Off to the right side of the screen we see the American-Brandenburgian naval scuffle, though this angle doesn’t allow us to gauge who has the advantage. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Here we get a better picture of the scuffle, and here it is easier to gauge the advantages and disadvantages. </p><p></p><p>But only a moment too late, as we just watch them make peace. That American fleet was lucky to have found itself at peace before Brandenburgian reinforcements could arrive. </p>"

      scene_title: "The Jawf Revolt"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene08.jpg
      narration: "<p>Longswordmen (presumably originally Yemeni) have launched a revolt at the Yemeni-Turkish border, between Sana’a, Mersin and Kayseri, pillaging the countryside at both sides of the frontier. Yemeni knights, apparently enjoying open borders with Turkey, are moving to apprehend them and quash the revolt. No doubt the Turks’ small but technologically superior garrison forces are gonna join in on the action too. Judging from the open borders and the current co-operation, I don’t think Yemen is going to listen to fans’ demands to invade Turkey’s soft underbelly any time soon. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Here we have an image of Aotearoa and eastern Australia and… *sigh* I had such high hopes for you, Maori, but you didn’t garrison your Australian colonies properly and were stupid enough to give Te Tokanganui away in a peace deal… Such is life. At least your capital is the biggest city on the slide. </p>"

      scene_title: "Meanwhile, in Hawaii"

      narration: "<p>Here’s a slide of Hawaii, and, honestly, I’m not sure what’s happening here… Guiyang, Ming’s vacation resort, is the biggest city here, the Mohave are kinda chilling and… What’s with all those damaged ships? 5 Kokangese, 2 Inca, 2 Mohave, 1 Ming and 1 Yemeni ship have all sustained damage. Is it a penalty for being on the ocean too long? Or is there a war I’ve missed? *checks info sheet* nope, no war here. </p>"

      scene_title: "Arapaho"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene11.jpg
      narration: "<p>The Arapaho, often criticized for their small army (I may not have voiced such critique, but I’ve certainly thought it) seems to be starting to maybe potentially idk heed our words, question mark. They’re rebuilding their Gulf Fleet after that fiasco against Central America of all people, and have built a large army of mixed tech levels in the Nii-cii-nec-iini’ - Quahadi - Hóo’uu Níit-ko’ús-i’i belt. Not enough to satisfy us sub-dwellers, but it’s a start at least. </p>"

      scene_title: "War profiteering"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene12.jpg
      narration: "<p>While the Rioplatense and Inca troops continue to duke it out on the plains and hills of the Platine Basin, Kayapó is mostly, though not completely, content to watch them go from the sidelines. To satisfy themselves, they decided to pluck a citadel on the coast, south of São Salvador, and they’ve outsourced the defence of the citadel to an Indonesian scout. A very unorthodox way to profit from a war, but ok. </p>"

      scene_title: "The Tundra Warfront"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene13.jpg
      narration: "<p>Over here we see the northern front of what has become the last remaining of Lithuania’s Eastern Wars. The Permyans are advancing into Lithuanian territory, dealing a tiny bit of damage to Anyksciai. Both sides got the units to hold the front, but lack reinforcements. The fact they’re fighting in the tundra and snow, pockmarked with rivers, hills and forests only further worsens the logistics of this front. </p>"

      scene_title: "Korean-Japanese War"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene14.jpg
      narration: "<p>North Korea and Mori seem to have bled each-other’s navies dry (at least the parts thereof that are actually able to reach the front). North Korea should count its lucky stars that Ming has too many ships for Mori to navigate more than 2 ships at a time to Jeju and that the Gokturks closed their borders to Mori. </p><p></p><p>Leading what’s left of the North Korean attack force on the undamaged Mori capital of Yoshida-Koriyama is Fernando Villaamil. IRL, Villaamil was a Spanish 19th century admiral. Born in Asturias, he would go on to serve in the Philippines and Cuba. He’s credited with the invention of the destroyer type of ship, with the first one being the Destructor, with him providing the blueprints for a British manufacturer to build and then sell to the Spanish navy. Between 1892 and 1894, he circumnavigated the World on the Nautilus. He spent the last 4-ish months of his life serving in the Spanish-American War, dying at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3rd July 1898. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, and correct me if I’m wrong, I think that, next to Miyao, we have our first sighting of the Mori UU, the Murakami Kobaya - a caravel replacement which is slower, but gets a movement boost in coastal tiles. It heals 10 HP on trade routes and 20 HP on tile improvements, and each adjacent land tile grants it +10 Combat Strength. </p><p></p><p>There’s another one near Sakurao, which I’m only mentioning in the hopes DocIdo pronounces the city’s name the same way BazBattles did in their battle of Miyajima video (timestamp ca. 9:48). Sakurao. </p>"

      scene_title: "Stuck"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene15.jpg
      narration: "<p>Here we see the stalemated Cree-Mohave War. </p><p></p><p>A Mohave fleet is lurking near Vancouver Island, but since there’s no city there, and since no other city on this coast is being attacked, I don’t think anything will come of their presence. </p><p></p><p>Cree seems to be attempting a land incursion south of Nisichawayasihk, but the Arapaho borders make the approach too narrow for any serious attack. With consistent enough unit production, even if it’s tiny, the small number of units will probably be enough for Mohave to hold them off at the hills between the bottleneck and Captain Jack’s Stronghold. </p>"

      scene_title: "In the high hills"
      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene16.jpg
      narration: "<p>You know what war isn’t stalemated? The Mohave invasion of Central America. Indeed, a combined land and sea assault is currently battering down the defences of Guatemala City. The city’s only defence is a cannon. Mohave cuirassiers are approaching, a privateer and a galleon are bombarding the city, and a cavalry unit has blocked off the only road connecting the capital to San Salvador. Things are looking bad for the Morazán. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Meanwhile, in the Mariana Islands, Timor-Leste has launched a campaign of conquest. Having already conquered Hukoara-ts-huerve, they are now sieging Qapotaq-iv’auve, and have even sent a vanguard to Avi Hamoka. We could see the Mohave Marianas collapse by the end of this episode. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Over on this slide we see Castile retaking Burgos, with a Malian response yet to properly materialize. Will it come in the form of a counterattack at said city? Or will it instead turn into a crossing into Andalucia? Or will Mali just… not do anything at all? I await to find out with baited breath. Well, not really. </p><p></p><p>Over in the corner, we also see a Norman equite committing suicide by Am Timan. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene19.jpg
      narration: "<p>Over here we see the much reduced domain of Aten’s chosen. Akhetaten is kinda pressured from all sides, yet also under no immediate threat. I’m assuming none of their neighbours wants to bite that warmonger penalty. Akhenaten insists otherwise however, claiming that the Power of Aten himself is defending the city, and the Chadians, Yemenis and Turks are simply afraid of whatever punishment Aten might dole out should they infringe on the city. His courtiers, who’ve been doing the actual ruling since the days of the empire being carved up, are only pretending to take these words seriously. They have instead taken to satisfying the masses by inviting them free-of-charge to great action dramas by John Woo, whose theatre work they’ve been patronizing. </p><p></p><p>IRL, John Woo is a Hongkongese film director, producer and scriptwriter, a pioneer in the genres of heroic bloodshed and gun fu, known for his highly chaotic bullet ballet action sequences, stylized imagery, Mexican standoffs, frequent use of slow motion, and allusions to wuxia, film noir and western cinema.</p>"

      narration: "<p>It feels kinda weird to see the non-Australian civ invading Australia being the green and gold one, rather than the other way around… Whatever. </p><p></p><p>We have a fully committed Inca amphibious invasion of the Australian mainland, clearly gunning for Minyanbal. And this is exactly how such an invasion should go - a sizeable mixed force of naval units and embarked land units. The only thing left to be desired is the number of units, but even so, the Inca invasion force outnumbers the local Wiradjuri garrison substantially. </p>"

      narration: "<p>I had no idea how to title this slide, so I just put the way my 1-year-old cousin calls me - Ba. </p><p></p><p>Anyways, in focus on this slide is the Mohave coast and the Ming vacation resort. Not much to see here except for Guiyang’s large population, a respectable homefleet of the Mohave, and the naval concert of one Screamin Jay Hawkins. </p><p></p><p>IRL, Screamin Jay Hawkins was an American singer, songwriter, musician, actor, film producer and boxer, famed for his operatic voice delivery and wildly theatrical performances. He sometimes included macabre props onstage, making him an early pioneer of shock rock. He was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for his side role in Mystery Train and his most famous song was I Put A Spell On You. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Yemen has sent another, larger invasion force against Pandya, but it had split its forces into two. </p><p></p><p>The Southern force is a healthy mix of ships and embarked melee troops, but it was also met by a roughly equal Pandyan defence fleet. Even if they win this particular naval battle, the southern force ain’t capturing Thoothukudi, as Pandya has more than enough ships in reserve. </p><p></p><p>The Northern force, on the other hand, is made up of a naval frontal group escorting an embarked trebuchet, with the embarked melee units trailing behind them. They also encountered a Pandyan defence fleet, but this one is outnumbered, so the Yemenis might have a chance at a breakthrough here. However, once again, the Pandya have a naval reserve off Kerala, and Zulu presence on the Lakshadweep and Indonesian and Zulu units on the sea split the battlesea into a number of chokepoints, further favouring the defenders. Yemen will need to send more reinforcements to this front if they hope to make gains. </p><p></p><p>A different Yemeni force is clearing out the seas of Pandya’s Deccani territories, but unless there’s a coastal city there (which I don’t recall one) they’re wasting their efforts there. </p>"

Khazaria is weak, but Afghanistan is only investing a few troops into the war, and even if Durrani was to commit more, the narrow, winding approach will stall any assault. </p>"

Things are mostly peaceful here now, safe for a few raiding Mohave frigates. The Gökturks and Cree are rebuilding their lands, cities and armies, Mori is peeking up from the south, Ainu and Seminole remnants found refuge with the Cree and Gökturks respectively, and units from Angola, Brandenburg, the Inca, Vladimir, Han, Kokang and North Korea have come to say “Hi”. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Anyone else share the sentiment in the slide title? </p><p></p><p>Tupac, you had a strong invasion force. You had started dealing damage to Minyabal. You have even weakened the garrison force. Why, for Inti’s sake, have you peaced out now? Heck, you could’ve at least asked for the city in the peace deal. But no. You just stopped there, just short of bringing back the green-and-gold colour scheme to Australia. </p><p></p><p>In all fairness, the Inca have made great gains in this war, capturing 4 Wiradjuri cities and settling a new one of their own, establishing a strong Pacific core stretching from Papua to Atacama, and with it a potential base for future conquests against the Wiradjuri and Maori and the potential to contest with Timor-Leste and Mohave. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene29.jpg
      narration: "<p>While Inca may have a dominant position on sea, on land they’re floundering. Their attempted counteroffensive towards São Salvador had failed, and a large Rioplatense army is now descending on Machu. They’re yet to deal any damage, but there are no Incan reinforcements on the horizon, so I like the Rioplatense chances here. While a general-colleague of his is dealing with that, general Bertrand du Guesclin has gone through an Andean mountain pass to personally reconnoiter the environs of Quito. </p><p></p><p>IRL, Bertrand du Guesclin was a lesser noble from Brittany who distinguished himself during the chaos of the Hundred Years’ War. After the great English victories in the Edwardian War and the Breton Succession War, Bertrand became a leader of one among many routieres, or free companies, active in the region throughout the war. He was eventually employed by the new French king, Charles V, and was promoted to Constable of France, which in military matters made him second only to the king. His strategy of raiding English supply lines and shadowing their movements in order to logistically destroy them would define the French war effort over the Caroline war, which, combined with Castilian naval support, would eventually lead to a French victory, England forced to cede all of its Aquitanian conquests and half of its northern conquests. </p>"

Yugoslavia’s Saharan territories of Split and Priština should have been easy pickings. But those absolute buffoons neglected to put a melee unit in front, and just uselessly sieged the former. Right after redeeming itself with its conquests against Tétouan, Mali has once again made itself a laughing stock, and I, for one, am all here for it. </p><p></p><p>Yugoslavia’s defensive victory here may have been a result of the enemy’s stupidity more than our successes, but a victory is still a victory.

There are a few units still milling about, led by general Juan Perón (IRL a past president of Argentina and founder of the eponymous Peronism ideology), but I think it’s safe to say that Vermont has been eliminated at 50th place. </p><p></p><p>Vermont was never a good civ in this run. They settled a few cities, but their attempt to ally with fellow small-civ Seminole to knock America down a peg or two backfired spectacularly, and both lost a city, in Vermont’s case Montpelier, as a result. IIRC, Montpelier didn’t even fall to an invading army, but a peace deal. Their far flung Icelandic colony was lost to Greenland after an otherwise inconclusive war. They were able to lie low for many episodes since, until last episode apparently saw a large coalition form against them (I assume under a similar memetic drive like the older Kilwa Delenda Est movement). Unfortunately for them, their bigger neighbour was part of that coalition, and had crushed their resistance like one might splat a fly. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Yemen is sending a third invasion force, this time much more consolidated, a denser group of units in the same area, with some diversionary vessels and embarkments further south.

      narration: "<p>In this shot, we see Ireland in most of its glory, as well as the Brandenburgian island colonies. The Anglo-Dutch seem to be making a move on these lands, potentially trying to strike at Galway and Baltimore. Brandenburg, meanwhile, got a new great writer in the form of Zygmunt Krasiński. (the Polish ń pronounced like the Spanish ñ)</p><p></p><p>IRL, Krasiński was a poet, remembered as one of the Three Bards - Polish romanticist poets who influenced national consciousness. His most famous works include The Undivine Comedy, Psalm to the Future*, Irydion and Predawn. </p><p></p><p>*Note: I find it quite weird how the Polish word for “future” is “przyszłośc”, as in my native Serbocroatian, the similar-sounding word “prošlost” means “past”. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Tuvan expedition in Han territory has moved south, into the area southeast of Jianye and around Longbian. And I finally realized what the Tuvans’ purpose here is - Tuva is at war with Ming, and this force moving through Han lands is supposed to be Tuva taking what would otherwise be an irrelevant war seriously. For the most part, Ming seems to be able to parry them technologically. The only field where Tuva has the edge here is their more advanced artillery. Let’s see if that’ll be enough to capture Fuzhou. I wouldn’t bet on it, but one can hope. </p>"

      narration: "<p>OH FUCK</p><p></p><p>Brandenburg has just DOW’d Yugoslavia. Taking good advantage of Tito’s absence, I see. No matter, the republics and autonomous provinces are taking charge of the war effort, with differing levels of efficiency. Brandenburg is strong, and the threat its army poses to Zagreb is very real, but I have trust that Yugoslavia will be able to pull through, its army bloodied and cities damaged, but borders intact. </p>"

      slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode22-scene81.jpg
      narration: "<p>At the same time, the Gökturks DOW Mori, presumably hoping to nab Usukeshi and maybe Miiri-Takamatsu. For a historically steppe-nomadic empire, the CBRX Gökturks seems to have eagerly embraced the sea, seen in their earlier successful conquest of the Ainu and now the naval invasion of Mori. A sizable fleet is descending on northern Japan, and reinforcements from both sides will be somewhat slow to arrive. Leading the Gökturk charge is admiral Alvaro de Bazan, his eyes firmly poised on the former final Ainu holdout of Usukeshi. </p><p></p><p>IRL, Alvaro de Bazan was a 16th century Spanish nobleman and admiral, notable for his participations in: Spain’s capture of Vélez de la Gomera (a rock in Morocco that’s under Spain’s rule to this day); the Christian relief force to the Great Siege of Malta; the quelling of the Morisco Revolt; the battle of Lepanto; the 1573 Spanish re-capture of Tunis; the Spanish incorporation of Portugal; and the capture of the last Portuguese anti-Spanish hold-out in the Azores. </p>"

      narration: "<p>In an interesting reversal of the usual shtick in the Yemeni-Pandyan War, a Pandyan galleon is bombarding Yemen’s Mauritian colony of Jibla. The city won’t fall to that ship, and I’m not sure the other one to the northeast is gonna be enough either, especially with that Yemeni frigate there. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Over here, we have a look at the Wiradjuri core, with a respectable fleet and the closest thing Wiradjuri has to a larger-than-a-garrison army. The citizens of Bungambrawatha, the largest city on slide, are enjoying a concert by The Smiths, IRL an English rock band whose style fuses 60s rock and post-punk. </p>"

      narration: "<p>America, tired of seeing Castile and Mali constantly flip Burgos between them, decided to swoop in, capture the now 1-pop city, and burn it to the ground. Any Malian unit is too far to retake the city in time to save it. </p>"

      narration: "<p>America is holding a firm advantage over Greenland now, even landing troops on Vinland, with a near-dead line infantry even dealing damage to Egedesminde. The city isn’t under any real threat of falling, and it's very likely the American landings will be bushed right back into the sea, but this is still a worrying sign for the Greenlanders. </p>"

      narration: "<p>The Tuvans have finally reached the Ming border, initiating their attack. However, things seem to have started on the wrong foot for them there. Rivers and Han units certainly aren’t helping the Tuvans either. </p>"

      narration: "<p>Predictably, the Tuvan-Afghan War has descended into a stalemate, as damaged Tuvan units are slowly trying to make their way into Afghan territory. In their way are Jalandhar’s line infantry garrison, a unit of uhlans, and our first sighting of the Afghan UU - the Jezailchi, a cavalry replacement that has 4 combat strength points less than cavalry, but compensates for that with +1 range, +34 ranged combat, as well as a 20% attack boost on hills and a 10% combat strength boost in friendly territory. </p>"

Helping them is the concert in Jinyang, held by the band Joy Division. </p><p></p><p>IRL, Joy Division is yet another English rock band. The band was only active for 4 years, as one of its members committed suicide, but they did win some fame, particularly with their songs Closer and Love Will Tear Us Apart. </p><p></p><p>An irrelevant war ends as Indonesia and the Massagetae make peace. </p>"

      narration: "<p>And right on cue, two irrelevant wars begin, as Kokang and the Anglo-Dutch declare on Botswana, giving us an excuse to take a look at the latter and their unit carpet. What’s with that weird salient of Zulu territory stretching from Maun to Selibe Phikwe, though?</p>"

      narration: "<p>Over here we see the Tuvan-Permyan border, and a contrast is immediately obvious. Having previously overcommitted to the Lithuanian war, the Permyans left their Tuvan border almost entirely defenceless. If Tuva declared now, they could easily snatch a city or two. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of, Tuva also accepted a peace deal from the Massagetae. </p><p></p><p>There’s also a Dusty Springfield concert in Pyras.

Oviedo is undamaged, but the Anglo-Dutch are increasing the pressure there too, and while their chances at Rotterdam are rapidly waning, they may yet luck out here. </p>"
