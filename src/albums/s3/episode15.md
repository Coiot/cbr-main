Kokang and Bengal engage in yet another war, which King Shuja-ud Din hopes to provide an avenue to escape Bengals increasingly shrunken position. Of course, the mighty Himalayas and the mountains of Myanmar will prevent much progress, save for the possible exception of the relatively undefended city of Chin Shwe Haw. </p>"

Yodoya Tatsugoro has made a killing selling his wares in the war torn lands, while the Kwak continue to weather storm after storm of Cree legions. The Kwak have many regiments of their scout UU, and a good navy, but can they really stem the tide? </p>"

    narration: "<p>We take a gander to the land down under, where women glow and men thunder. Where early on we complained about Wiradjuri’s lack of interest in settling most of Australia, they’ve gotten their act together a bit in recent episodes. Still, it feels delayed, as Maori has a considerable swathe of some of the best land available ‘round these parts. And the worst part is, the Wiradjuri AI seems to be entirely incompetent when it comes to war, so I’m not holding my breath for a success story here. </p>"

Upon the cities recapture, this legion fortells of the return of the Cree. No gains are to be made today. The best that can be done is to burn it to the ground. </p>"

Its not like she’s going to gain much out of a war anyways. Just looking at the border, and the Arapaho’s relative lack of troops, shows that violence wasn’t really in the hearts and minds of her side, and the Kwak have a much bigger deer to take by the horns anyhow. </p>"

Admiral Yi, however, has a plan.</p><p> </p><p>Brandenburg has gathered eons of discontent from its many settlements and conquests, and with it, he has bribed many mercenaries and militias to cause ruckus.

Once the undisputed apex predators of the cylinder, a two-pronged invasion by the Tuvans and Massagatae have exposed them as a shell of their former selves.

Well…there is still the snowy interior of Greenland, but I wouldn’t settle that if I were you…oh, they already have a settler there. I hope the city’s name is something humorous, at least. </p>"

Well, at least you aren’t completely faltering, with your cities and carpet. It’ll be a slow, brutal stagnation instead. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Despite the brave efforts of the Norse mercenaries, Operation Valkyrie was not quite enough to prevent the conquest of Ludenburh. Fredrick Wilhelm, paranoid of potential further defectors and dealing with discontent within the military, orders the burning of the city, and the Anglo-Norse’s doom grows ever more certain. However, behind closed doors in the Danish straits, in his own personal fortress, Admiral Yi is cooking. Cooking up one last plan for victory.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>We take a quick gander over to the lands of the Maori. Despite a struggle early on with gold and happiness, Maori have managed to cook themselves a nice maritime empire. There’s still an available spot at the very southern tip of the South Island, I’d like to see them settle but otherwise I have no complaints.</p><p></p><p>Lacs has highlighted a Maori Great Artist by the name of Dziga Vertov. In another life this guy was a soviet film director. Cinema isn’t quite invented yet, so maybe he’s doing theater instead? </p><p></p><p>I also can’t help but notice the duo of Wiradjuri settlers sailing in the middle of the Maori empire, by Taumaranui, where our dear Semiramis is also situated currently. Maybe we’ll soon hear of a Maori plan to nuke Syd- what do you mean the city doesn’t exist? Goddammit. Maybe the city was already nuked off the map.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>We witness the easternmost edges of the mighty Afghan empire. A stalwart top 5 contender for the last several episodes, the Afghans have swiftly settled the Tibetan plateau, creating small, defensible, but somewhat poorly growing cities. Milton S. Hershey, taking it upon himself to cheer these poor fools up, is currently en route to Sheberbagan, to potentially taste a rich, dark, drink that the locals have been using to stay warm in the dark winters, made of poppy seeds of course. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We take a gander at Ireland, whom last episode were continually forward settled by an international coalition of nations. Though the Irish didn’t take kindly to the coming of the English, they have thus far tolerated the Brandenburger, Greenlandic and American settlers on their domains. However, what they very adamantly care about is religion. Pope Michael Collins has brought into his employ the grand inquisitor Baldwin IV, duke of Cork and a fervent aggressor when it comes to matters of religion. Could this be a sign of a crusade?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Up here by the Bering Strait not much is happening. Kwaks settle New Tsaxis in Asia in the hopes that this one won’t be burnt to the ground. But mostly the city contributes to the weird tangle of borders between Kwak and the Göktürks. It almost looks like they’re holding hands, how adorable. It’ll be less adorable when it is revealed they’re both holding a dagger in their free hand. </p>"

    narration: "<p>In what can only be described as a miracle, the mighty vikings manage to reclaim the smoldering city of Ludenbruh! Admiral Yi, the absolute madman, a godlike tactical genius on every level of warfare, has launched a daring diversion on the city of Roskilde, whilst a small detachment has gone on to free Ludenbruh from Brandenburger hands. He smiles at news of the success of the operation, as his ships coast into the well defended walls of the old Anglo-Norse capitol. The chances of victory here are slim, but what is there for an old fart like him to lose. He has done all he can to save his nation.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We take a look at the lands of Vladimir. Lacs is highlighting the Prince’s Retinue UU, but I’m pretty sure we already saw this unit last episode, so I won’t tire you with a repeat. Personally I quite like the look of Vladimir, it’s just a dang shame it’s stuck between Lithuania, Permians, and Turkey, all top 15 contenders, if not even top 10 contenders. We’re still trying to figure out if the Permians deserve a spot in the top 10 or not. (Spoiler: they probably don’t.)</p>"

    narration: "<p>Of course, such a magnificent victory couldn’t last. The heroes of Ludenbruh are swiftly vanquished by the Brandenburger invaders. Yi’s diversionary force, too, seems doomed to fail, the inhabitants of Roskilde forgetting their former overlords. The soldiers set the torch once more on Ludenbruh, watching the bodies of the brave defenders on tiny ships, blazing into the night, a tradition they saw across the straits, their compatriots immolating themselves rather than surrender. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Off in the bay of Biscay, the Irish and Castilian fleets lock heads in a fruitless, yet important battle. Oviedo could be the start of an Irish launching point into mainland Europe. But for now, their still reluctant populace get to witness clash after clash of their new and old overlords, deadlocked in the bay of Biscay. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We mosey on over to the barbarian Kilwan horde, where one day they became global pariahs for no good reason. And holy fuck, the Yemeni navy has modernized overnight. Yemen does have some of the best tech on the cylinder, so this is not an unreasonable development, but it is one I did not expect. While before Kilwan tech supremacy was giving them the edge, now it looks like they are squarely outmatched. Very disheartening. Still, I stand behind what I said about Kilwa’s core being safe in this war. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Taking a break away from all the action, we witness a fun coincidence. We witness upon here the dawn of the great merchant Thomas Waghorn, son of the great heads of Wagga-Wagga! Irl, Waghorn was the first man to have theorized the feasibility of a route between Britain and India via the then-canalless Egypt. Perhaps he can provide new opportunities to the Wiradjuri? </p>"

    narration: "<p>We take a look at the Cree’s eastern polity, finding that their core in this part of the world is nothing but snow and more snow. With the occasional American and Arapaho intruder. Poundmaker must be wary, because a potential American invasion could gut his domain like a fish. Or it could not, and become utterly forgotten to the annals of history. We shall see.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Meanwhile in South America, Inca are still quite fond of splitting up their armies between the available targets. So nothing new there really, but I do notice the Chilean carpet. The war wasn’t that long ago, and they’ve already fully recovered, ready to charge back in. That’s the kind of energy I like to see in my battle royale. </p><p></p><p>Oh yeah, and Caravaggio, who in real life had a “formative influence on Baroque painting”, is here to keep the Chilean cultural scene lively as well. It might be a bit early for Baroque art, but his innovations will most certainly be welcome nevertheless.</p>"

Quite embarrassing for the so-called #1 civ. </p><p></p><p>Also, peep the Kokang city, that’s quite the GNARLY location. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We get a look at the two major cores of Africa - the dual meme powers of Angola and Chad. They have just about everything you can ask for from great powers - good powerbases, good militaries, good tech, etc. The one thing they both lack is aggression, but lets be fair here aggression takes a decent bit of investment. Wouldn’t it be better to hang back and buff up with your bros? </p>"

    narration: "<p>We mosey on over to the Turkish empire. A theocratic military dictatorship, Pasha Ataturk has completed the Potala Palace, a winter home where he can spend those frigid Cappadocian nights in deep prayer to Allah. The Turks are still a grand contender for best civ in the game, and perhaps Ataturks devotion to God and nation may prove to be a big factor, alongside their grand stats. For now, the Turkish populace enjoy a momentary respite from the grand conquests that occurred not so long ago. </p>"

    narration: "<p>It is now high time to look at the governance structures of the world! Coming on the first slide of these, we take notice of the Irish Papacy, the only one currently of its kind. We also witness various republics, military dictatorships and monarchies. Notably, the USA decided to double down on their LARP by becoming a true republic and the sub is a monarchy!

    narration: "<p>We move about to the next page, where we discover that Fredrick Wilhelm has taken personal charge as commander-in-chief against the barbarian Norse, a true warrior-king. The Chadians are also a dictatorship, while it becomes apparent that the Kwakwaka'wakw-Cree conflict is a trade war, as the Cree are a merchant confederacy of various northern tribes. Notably, we got two peasant republics. The first, of the Egyptians, where a man named Moses riled up the rabble to create a theocratic peasant state. The second, the Cambodians, where Norodom Sihanouk has brought on a clever peasant named Pol Pot to serve as a direct bridge to the people.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>In this page, we notably get to the Kayapo, which is also a merchant league. In an age of war, the Kayapo have instead opted to max out their trade node and collect their gains. The Han have also fittingly declared themselves heirs to the mandate of heaven, becoming an imperial dynasty, while the Ducklads are actually a principality. Whoops. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We move on to see that the Kilwa have abandoned the old ways of the Horde, with the Khans instead positioning themselves as a fullblown military dictatorship (thats of course still led by Ali ibn Hassan.) We also get to see some LARPing as the game grants Ataturk the title of Pasha and the epithet of “the Beloved, Precious One.” Turkey’s eternal leader at it huh. </p>"

Notably, Cestwahyo is now known by the epithet “The Holy,” and the Vermontians have not quite progressed basic tribal structures. I seriously enjoy these slides even if they’re kinda hard to write about!

He is a Hong Kong billionaire, business magnate, investor, and philanthropist, and he is the 31st richest person in the world.

With a prompt order, two triremes approach the Filipino capital of Malolos, seeking to extort and plunder. They probably will die fruitlessly but its not about efficiency.

Will Tuva’s embarrassment never end? All these units and yet defeat. Morale must be at an all time low. </p><p></p><p>Han’s military competence is likely in part due to the genius of one Albrecht von Wallenstein, who in real life became the supreme commander of the Imperial Army of the HRE, fighting on the side of the Catholics in the Thirty Years War. </p>"

Maybe they heard of what the Lithuanians are doing and wanted to replicate everything a top 5 civ does. Yeah, that makes sense.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, Li Bing, the newest Kayapo Great Engineer, is here to build yet another wonder for his magnanimous leader.
