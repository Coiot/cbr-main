  narration: "<p>Greetings, ladies, gentlemen and otherfolk, and welcome to another episode of the Civ Battle Royale X Season 3. Your narrator for today is BV aka Boki (u/anarcho-balkan on reddit) and I’m very glad to have been given yet another chance to write this. I believe this is the 3rd time this season and 4th time overall that I narrate an episode. If you’ve been following for the past 2 episodes, you’d know that we’re currently in the middle of total war. Will the season end with this cycle, or will total war merely decide which civs get into cycle 2? Unfortunately, that’s not a question this episode will answer. One thing’s for sure though, billions of virtual lives will be lost, whole civilizations will die, and the great empires will demonstrate their power. </p><p></p><p>Note for the audio-narrator: the o in Boki is pronounced like the o in Holland and the i in Boki as the i in kick</p>"

  narration: "<p>As always, here's the map by Virheaa (u/Virheaa)! In addition to the usual thing of being a good snapshot of where we left off last week, this one also doubles as a handy tool to see which areas were devastated the most by total war. I definitely don’t envy Angola and the Anglo-Dutch. </p>"

If you’re able to (unlike me, I would donate if I could), consider donating some money to the CBRX Ko-Fi page. Even just 1 unit of whatever currency is local where you live helps. I heard you get cool perks too, like early access and the director’s cut. Pretty neat. </p>"

  narration: "<p>For our PR slide, although we could focus on Inca retaining 1st place or Central America getting revived or Bengal, who had the largest rank delta of any already previously alive civ, rising 5 ranks, I’d instead like to shine the spotlight on Mali, rising 3 spots to reach the top 4.</p><p>Thus far in total war, they unified Iberia and are making minced meat of the Angolans. Gone are the days when Mali was a laughing stock for failing to invade Tétouan and Yugoslavia’s Saharan cities, even losing cities to the former. They are now not just a great empire and superpower, but a serious contender to win it all. Angola’s general emptiness promises further gains in that direction, but what after that? How well will they fare against the tech giant that is Turkey, or the massive fleets of Brandenburg? Only time will tell. </p>"

A similar fate was suffered by the originally Assyrian (remember them?) city of Nineveh. (random tangent: I’m always confused by the English spelling of the city, since in Serbocroatian we spell it Niniva)</p><p></p><p>The Yemeni capital, Sana’a, is in red health but not only is there no unit in range to threaten it, but the city is well protected by a shield of mountain terrain, power armor infantry, battlesuits and a giant death robot, with moral support from two great generals and great engineers each and a settler. </p><p></p><p>Turkey launches a thrust into the gap in Oman,  with a railgun armor and biotrooper taking position between Yemeni Taizz and Afghan Ghazni. </p><p></p><p>3 Afghan suppercarriers are uselessly anchored nearby Diyarbakir, while a Yemeni advanced destroyer seems to be doing a suicide attack on the Afghan fleet in the Gulf of Oman. </p><p></p><p>Also, some Chadian destroyers and battleships have come to say hi. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Gotta hand it to the Anglo-Dutch. They really turned out to be more competent than anyone, myself included, expected of them this season. Now, their empire lies crippled by the total war (despite Brandenburg being the one to take best advantage of it, I think it’s rather mostly Greenland who’s responsible (yes I am that much of a Brandi anti)), but still alive. I probably would’ve loved AD more if the civ they proved their competence against wasn’t Ireland, whom I liked more than them. Now we see most of their main remaining army launching an incursion into Brandenburg lands, while the remnants of the navy defend from Brandi attacks on the Hague and are trying to contest Oviedo from the Americans. At least England being gone now means there’s an empty buffer on that front, for now. </p>"

Power armor infantry, battlesuits, railgun armors, drone UAVs and bazookas drown Norman and Angolan cities. </p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, the Turkish navy moves into the area, making a precarious hold over the Normans’ med cities. </p><p></p><p>Angola’s last Mediterranean holdout is the Tétouani city of Salé, besieged by Malian units. The Saharan cities of Benguela and the originally Yugoslav Pristina are under serious threat of falling too. What Mali couldn’t conquer in what should’ve been a completely one-sided war against Yugoslavia ages ago is now falling to them easily in total war against the superpower Angola. How times change. </p><p></p><p>On top of the screen, the former Norman capital of Salerno, until now held by Yugoslavia, is captured by Turkish forces. </p><p></p><p>Somewhere nearby Belgrade, an overweight guy who volunteered for the Yugoslav People’s Army weeps, knowing Titograd isn’t gonna be Yugoslav ever again. </p>"

  narration: "<p>MAN. </p><p></p><p>Multiple cities are wiped off the map in the Caribbean region. </p><p></p><p>Central America’s brief return to life is squashed beneath the feet of power armor infantry in the service of their ancient rivals, the Muisca. </p><p></p><p>America is reduced to a two-city, maybe three-city rump, as the Arapaho advance inches onwards. So onwards, in fact, that they’re now fighting the few surviving Muisca units in the region. </p><p></p><p>Inca advances from the south, as a fleet of advanced destroyers captured Guatavita, and Muisca’s sole undamaged city, Duitama, is threatened by a force of railgun armor, supplemented with battlesuits, power armor infantry and a nexus, equipped with 4 aerial and/or bomb and/or missile units. </p><p></p><p>Also, since Virheaa neglected to make a eulogy for Greenland, since, reasonably, no one could be sure at any point in time if Greenland was dead or not, I’ve taken the liberty to go through all the slides to see if Greenland captures any city, and since they don’t, I used the existence of a Greenlandic paratrooper in Nicaragua as an excuse to eulogize. </p><p></p><p>Greenland was never expected to be a great civ, having been ranked 45th in the original rankings. Greenland is usually a religion-focused civ, but oddly enough, it didn’t start a religion in the CBRX, in an interesting mirror to Central America, which is usually atheistic, and yet was one of the earliest founders of a religion this season. Greenland was one of the less active civs this season, but it did see its fair share of wars. Vermont lost their Icelandic city to them, IIRC, and they had a few spats with Ireland, gaining Tralee and Oviedo for their trouble. Oddly enough, Christianshåb, the originally Greenlandic city on Ireland, they didn’t lose in a war with the Irish, but in a stupid peace deal with Mali. Yes, Mali. They fought a few wars with America, which, while Greenlandic defeats, were nowhere near the decisive American victories we expected them to be. It wasn’t until Arapaho invaded Greenland just before total war that they lost their remaining mainland North American territories and some of their own island. In total war, Greenland lost the rest of the homeland, but their huge diaspora army wrecked havoc across the world, even capturing a stray city every now and again, and even briefly reviving Central America. If for nothing else, Greenland will be remembered for their crazy total war showing. For an otherwise boring civ to go out in a blaze of glory, well, it’s quite an achievement. F. </p>"

Why they feel like that, they do not know. It just feels right. But why? Was there a previous world where the area their cities are in were dominated, maybe even founded by a green and gold civ? </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Antarctica, the Babylonian sub-dwellers snicker, knowing that the citizens of Pukearuhe and Djirrildhuray are correct, but finding it hilarious that those poor souls would never have any way of knowing this. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Platine valley area plays host to the main clash of the two titans of South America. Salta seems to be the main area of combat here. The Inca attackers hold a numerical superiority on this front, but the tech advantage goes to the defending Kayapó forces. Notably, the Inca lack any nexi on this front, while the Kayapó have 5. While the Inca still rely mostly on battlesuits, the Kayapó are using GDRs. Which of these two will prevail?</p><p></p><p>Off to the side, Mali’s army around Recife is being less a threat and more a nuisance to the Kayapó. The same can’t be said about their navy, ironically smaller than the army, which is currently bombarding the former Brazilian capital, Rio de Janeiro. The Kayapó have deployed a biotrooper, nexus and cybersub in defense of the city, and an arsenal ship to slow down any Malian reinforcements, so the city may not fall at all or it might be flipped if it does fall, but the situation is still not ideal. </p>"

He knows that the end is nigh for him and his people. Soon, he was approached by someone. However, that someone is not an enemy, as he expected. No, an overweight man, wearing Yugoslav military gear, but also some aperture he’s never seen before, not even from the Turks, came. The man speaks “Comrade marshall… it’s time to go now.”. Tito responds “Yes, I know, this is the end of Yugoslavia”. The soldier continues “I’m gonna need you to follow me. We’re going to a place no Yugoslav except me knows about.”. Tito is surprised and confused “Where are we going?”. “The sub” the strange man replies. “The sub?” “Yes.” An awkward pause ensues as they head back down the building. The soldier than speaks “I have to admit. I am not actually a Yugoslav, at least not a Yugoslav of this world. I’m not a volunteer descended from a Titogradian soldier from the second Norman War.”. “Then what are you?” Tito inquires. “I’m from a group of, for the purposes of your world, immortal humans, observing the cylinder. We call ourselves the Babylonians, and we’re based off of a nuclear submarine in Antarctica. I’m not sure if the Castilians or Ugandans ever told anything about us to you.” “The Castilians didn’t tell us anything. The Ugandans did, but we dismissed them as making a discovery up to make their insane leader look good.” “Figures. Anyway, I’m here to take you to where all eliminated leaders go. To join us on the sub. For the rest of this cylinder’s existence and to witness all future cylinders.” “All future cylinders?” Tito shouts in disbelief. “Have there been past ones?” “There sure were! This is the 5th one, though I do not remember the 1st one. All the leaders and some other people from those previous worlds are in the sub too. In fact, the man to conquer the 4th one, Lawtiliwadlin of the Chukchi, is currently captaining the submarine!” Tito remains silent “This… is a lot to take in” “Heh, I thought that’d be your reaction. Don’t worry, me and some other Babylonians waiting for us will take you and what few soldiers, civilians and figures of state would follow us to safety. Then you’ll have an eternity to get used to your new lives.”. Hours later, this group of a few dozen people is gathered, and are taken by Babylonian tech to Antarctica. The Babylonian who joined the Yugoslav army turns to Tito for the last time before they enter the seclusion zone “Welcome aboard!”. </p></details>><p>Belgrade has fallen to the Turks, and the last Yugoslav unit in the slide is a submarine, so we can officially call Yugoslavia eliminated at 23rd place. RIP. </p><p></p><p>Since at least the beginning of the season, probably since the voting for this or maybe even the voting for last season, I’ve been a Yugoslavia fan. That comes as no surprise. I am from Montenegro, a country that used to be one of Yugoslavia’s republics. I’m a leftist, and although of a rather different and hardline anti-authoritarian kind as opposed to the authoritarianism of socialist Yugoslavia, I still held a soft spot for it. Me voting and campaigning for Yugoslavia had a lot to do with IRL history and stuff and little to nothing with the mod. </p><details><summary>History Dropdown</summary><p>A socialist revolution forged from the struggle to liberate the homeland from its fascistic occupiers and their local collaborators resulted in one of the rare occasions in WW2 that a country mostly (tho not completely) was liberated by itself. After that, while still following the trend of a popular front coalition led by a communist party being the only one running in politics, Yugoslavia’s socialism followed a very different direction than the other ML states of the Cold War, especially after 1948 and the Tito-Stalin split. A move to separate the party, front and state from each other and a policy of debureaucratization were pursued, leading to the Yugoslav citizenry to have a level of freedom that, while lesser than that of the liberal democracies in western Europe, was such that people living in most other one-party states and dictatorships in that era could only dream of. Every time people made a protest at what was deemed excess by the state, the Yugoslav state would respond with new laws and, on 4 separate occasions, whole new constitutions to remedy the issue. Not to mention that, in Yugoslavia, collectivization took the form of workers’ self-managment via workers’ councils and elected boards rather than simply nationalizing everything under a state bureaucracy. Yugonostalgia still exists for a reason, as for most regular people back then, before the economic crisis and the 90s wars, life was good. There’s a reason one of my uni professors, Šerbo Rastoder, told me when I passed his History of Yugoslavia exam this semester that “Colleague Boris, if only you were alive in that time. I think you would’ve loved it.”. </p></details><p>I like to imagine that, any time Yugoslavia wasn’t in a relevant war in the CBRX S3, life was more or less just like that, just at varying different tech levels across time. A nice existence. And yet, when we went to war, we fought furiously. The first Norman war saw us march into Messina. We fought two wars with Brandenburg that ended up indecisive. The Malian war should’ve been hopeless, and yet we held onto our distant Saharan cities, Split and Pristina, by the sheer incompetence of our enemy. The Normans and Brandenburgers then descended on us together. We lost our Saharan cities, we lost Titograd, my hometown, and had to concede peace. But, we didn’t give up. Far from falling to the mightiest European civ, we took the fight to the Brandenburgers. We captured Potsdam, we captured Königsberg, heck, we almost captured Berlin. But, as great as Tito and Yugoslavia were at war, Tito was bad at peace deals. Not only did we make a stupid peace deal in which we gave up our Brandenburgian conquests, we even gave the enemy a backdoor at Messina. When the Brandenburgers came knocking again, this time with Anglo-Dutch and Greenlandic support, we fought tenaciously. Zagreb was destroyed in the war, but we held on. We held on, until we couldn’t any longer. Losing Skopje in the war and Ljubljana and a recaptured Messina in the peace deal, we were now relegated to just Belgrade and Sarajevo. And yet, we still got our last hurrah by capturing the Norman capital of Salerno and the city of Melfi, getting to keep the former in a peace deal. Total war then came, and although in a position between Brandenburg and Turkey this was always gonna be a hopeless fight, we nevertheless gave our best to fight, even taking Melfi from the Normans again. We slowly lost, but we made the Brandenburgers and Turks pay for each meter of soil in blood. Against all odds, we were able to retake our capital after our perennial švabe* enemies had previously captured it, and then held it to the bitter end, when the Turks arrived. Yugoslavia may have fallen, but it went down fighting a last stand. The guiding star of brotherhood and unity never wavered, not even in these darkest days, the days of total war. </p><p>* note for audio-narrator: š = sh, abe pronounced like the Abe in Shinzo Abe</p><p></p><p>The Yugoslav and working people, the Serb, Croat, Muslim, Macedonian, Slovene and Montenegrin nations, the Albanian, Hungarian, Turkish, Slovak, Romanian, Bulgarian, Rusyn, Czech, Italian, Ukrainian, German, Russian and Polish nationalities, all Yugoslavia held until the very end. Until we couldn’t hold no longer. For all the blunders Yugoslavia and Tito have done (cough, Brandenburg peace deals, cough), they’ve truly made me proud with their performance this season. Not in the way that the me from back when the season started would’ve hoped, but they’ve made me proud nonetheless. The last Yugoslav survivors heading into the Babylonian sub right now should get in with their heads held high. They’ve earned that. </p><p></p><p>Finally, for the last bit of this slide, I’m gonna put up the English translation of the lyrics of a song. While in the original it was sung in a positive, happy, celebratory manner, I think the text is still good for the purposes of being recited in a more solemn, almost tragic tone, too. </p><p></p><p>When I look at our sea,</p><p>Our rivers, our mountains,</p><p>All the beauty where I was born,</p><p>And all I could say, </p><p>I’ve written on my heart, </p><p>Long Live Yugoslavia!</p><p></p><p>Land of peace, land of Tito, </p><p>Land brave and proud, </p><p>All the World knows of you, </p><p>We love you, our mother, </p><p>We won’t give you to anyone, </p><p>Long Live Yugoslavia!</p><p></p><p>That’s where marshal Tito was born, </p><p>Our name of pride, </p><p>As a hero known to the whole World, </p><p>The land is blessed for having him, </p><p>They’d be remembered for centuries, </p><p>Long Live Yugoslavia! </p><p></p><p>*breaks down crying*</p>"

Turkey’s saving grace here is that Mali doesn’t seem to have nexi and barely has any navy in the Mediterranean, so it can hope to ravage any embarked units Mali throws at them, while also enjoying a strong unit supporting from above. </p>"

And I’m definitely one of the people responsible for that memetic drive, both during voting, choosing which civs I’d root for this season, and being one of those encouraging whoever made the civball to make it. Their only real achievements were taking some Egyptian land, trapping Uganda into its mountains and eliminating Egypt when they finally decided they wanted Akhetaten. After that, they just sat there as their neighbours got stronger. They had an indecisive slapfight with the Normans, but that’s pretty much it. They were later invaded by Angola, and although they gave it their best shot, they were ultimately defeated and suffered a humiliating peace deal, which essentially made them the new Egypt. They proceeded to just sit there until total war. They managed to survive Angola, and their fleet was even able to become a nuisance to Turkey and Yemen, but that and their relatively dense carpet could only postpone the inevitable. Angola finally managed to take Moundou, and then Turkey finally came in force, and Chad could never survive that. Now their last cities fall to Turkey. F. </p><p></p><p>But, judging from the state of things on this slide, Chad’s last holdouts may not stay Turkish for long. Aouzou is surrounded on three sides by the Malian tidal wave and UAVs and helicopter gunships are approaching Sarh. Or they’re only flanking Moundou, but I don’t see the need for that, as the city’s only defence is a mech artillery. That and the one at the southern edge of the screenshot also happen to be the only Angolan units on this slide, too. While the situation is more up to question northwest of here, here Mali has an undeniable edge over Turkey. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Another Han city was nuked off the map. Considering how huge a carpet Han had going into total war, it’s kinda surprising seeing the Han Empire so empty now. By this point, I’d bet for a Tuvan breakthrough somewhere on the Ötüken - Chengdu - Qarakhoja line. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Despite losing Nar Le to Tuva last episode (you mistook your pre-Total-War Central Asian borders during your narration, Vihreaa), the Mohave exclave in the region is still alive. In fact, it’s not even the city most likely to change hands in this slide, as a large Tuvan contingent is descending on Samagaltay. Wouldn’t it be funny if Avi Mota held out longer than the Mohave’s Californian cities?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tuva has lost much of its carpet, unable to breach Turkey beyond Birzai. Heck, their force in Kola has failed to capture Palanga from Brandi this entire episode. </p>"

  narration: "<p>On the steppelands of Eurasia, Turkey has gained a numbers advantage over Tuva, and is advancing on Cherdyn and Jaxartes. Despite the fact that Tuva has thus far gained a city against Turkey without losing any to Turkey in the process, I think we’ve gotten our confirmation by this point: quality > quantity.</p>"

  scene_title: "Timor Time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode38-scene76.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timor captured Inti Watana, but otherwise little has changed on this front. Timor definitely holds an edge here, but they seem to have taken a page out of Inca’s strategy in South America, except more successful and a bit faster. See: title of slide 32. </p>"

  scene_title: "We Stan the Afghans"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode38-scene77.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turkey seems to have captured Pul-i-Alam a while back, but by this point it’d appear that Afghanistan has taken back control of the situation in… basically every front it has. In this turn alone, Durrani has captured 3 cities from 3 of his enemies - Nasirabad from Bengal, Htin Par Keng from Kokang and, as seen on the part of the map visible here, Ghazni from Turkey. Both Ghazni and Pul-i-Alam seem contested right now, as does Kabul. Meanwhile, Yemen has retaken Taizz. </p>"

  scene_title: "Bruh moment"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode38-scene78.jpg
  narration: "<p>In their rush to capture the undefended Berlin, the AD have overextended, allowing Brandi to take AD’s capital, The Hague. It’d take a while before AD can bring a power armor infantry over to retake the city (which if you follow the minimap, you’ll know they will before the episode is over), leaving William to take residence in London instead. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Mali is slowly moving to surround Utrecht. </p><p></p><p>Off to the side, a Turkish GDR approaches. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Mali captures Aouzou, though there are still plenty of Turkish units around to contest it. Sarh is much less defended by Turkey, but Mali doesn’t seem that interested in it yet. How Angola has been able to keep Moundou this long is beyond me. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode38-scene80.jpg
  narration: "<p>Having retaken one of their own snow cities a little while back, the Arapaho now strike at Hokkaido and capture the former Ainu capital, Sat Poro Pet, from the Gokturks. </p><p></p><p>It seems that that one coastal city that served as the Gokturks’ provisional capital has been nuked off the map, forcing Bumin to move inland to Bolchu. </p>"

  narration: "<p>https://www.tumblr.com/svere-online/634066784308297728/it-keeps-happening-edit-i-added-my-url-to-this</p><p></p><p>Hokusave and Aha Kwahwat fall to the Arapaho. There’s still some Mohave units around, fighting along the deserts and river valleys and they can still flip Aha Kwahwat, but the Mohave core is as good as gone. The Mexican and Baja settlements are surely next. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh, so *that’s* why there was no change to the frontline on the slides showing the area north of here for a long time. It’s because Inca has actually retaken Pukawa and Te Tokanganui. I’m not sure how long that’s gonna last though. That’s a good number of Timorese ships and a small but tough land force coming. Indeed, next slide will show Pukawa falling to Timor offscreen.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Timor’s African army pushes north, capturing Angola’s last port city of Moçâmedes, as well as the Angolan capital of Huambo. Savimbi flees north into Luanda, but he’s not safe there either, as the Malians are approaching. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Timor has also captured Semarang and the former Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. Next stop: Patna and Cavite el Viejo. </p><p></p><p>And with that, my friends, we’ve come to the end of another exciting episode of the Civ Battle Royale X Season 3. </p><p></p><p>From the deaths of Greenland, Central America, Yugoslavia, Chad, America and Muisca, to the ongoing collapse of Angola, Mohave, Bengal and Gokturks, to Afghanistan, Mali, Turkey, Arapaho, Inca and Timor proving themselves to be absolute monsters, to the plucky Anglo-Dutch making Brandi bleed, to whatever the fuck Yemen is doing, we’ve seen it all. </p><p></p><p>I hope you enjoyed this episode, and I’ll see you soon… somewhere.
