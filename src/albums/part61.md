  narration: "Come on! Come all! It’s the 61st part of r/civ’s Battle Royale! I’ll
    be your narrator for this part, /u/_xSyracuse. You all may know me from my occasional
    comments on r/civbattleroyale, or my annoying banter and failed roasts on the
    CBR’s Discord Chat! I’d love to thank Tpangs for this opportunity, and I’m really
    grateful. \nQuick Note before we begin: I am flying blind through this album,
    and every slide you see is also the first time I’m seeing it as well, this is
    done so I don’t spoil anything throughout this part.\nNow, this amazing cover
    slide is made by u/TheBenno (Hey like, Benno! 4th time’s the charm!), and showcases
    the remaining civs at the beginning of this part. Nobody but Japan, Hawaii, and
    Persia seems particularly happy about being so close together, but that’s probably
    just because they’re happy to even be alive."

    us an animated map of the progress of the CBR Mk. II so far.\nOf interest:  \n-The
    Mysterious Disappearance of Ireland\n-The Flip of Sydney\n-Bye Mali\n-Bye France\n-Bye
    Morocco\n-South America doing nothing most of the time"

  narration: On to the map! The only real changes after part 60 is the noticeable
    lack of Red in the Western Hemisphere, and A much darker green has been introduced
    into the Arabian Peninsula. Also, apparently Brown is the new Maroon, and Sparta
    has captured 4 cities from Armenia, including the  Israeli capital of Jerusalem.
    I wonder what u/edse1991 will have to change on their next map after the conclusion
    of this part.

    The Boers remain in first place again. They declared a war last part! And one easily within it’s XCOM range, but yet, just like the SOPA war, refused to actually do anything. Although, I do commend Ethiopia for sucking up to the Paul Kruger (Boers) so much for him to wake up and declare a war with them! Good Job Hailee (Ethiopia)!
    Although, according to the Power Rankings, Ekeuhnick of the Inuit is catching up to the Boers, and nearly took the #1 spot this week!

  narration: "The next victim of the Armenian “conquest” of Sparta is the Armenian
    city of Gyumri falling, and city right next to the capital of Yerevan. Tiridates
    III of Armenia must be sweating by now, as his (barely existent) defense is faltering.
    \nAlso of note is the fact that the Final Arabian stronghold of Jericho (which
    in our timeline is the oldest, continuously inhabited walled city in the world…
    Fun Fact!)\nThree French units appear in Spartan Territory, A Trebuchet, a Great
    War Infantry, and a Galleass South Eastwards of the infamous city of Dvin.\nThe
    Last Legion still swims in the black sea.\nAnd Sibir has developed Cybersubs,
    as shown in the Caspian Sea."

  narration: |-
    It appears that The Lion of The North is plotting against…Stalin and the USSR! Now, why this is, I haven‘t a clue, and I’m not a gambling man, but If I were, I would guess that Gustavus isn’t pleased that Stalin pretty much gave Iceland all that French Clay, instead of giving it to Sweden. Although, no offense to our beloved Semiramis, Civilization V spies don’t get the most reliable information most of the time. I don’t know what’s going to be played out between these two civ, but I want blood.
    Also of Note: Sweden has Mechanized Artillery, which I believe is brand spanking new from the research labs of Trondheim, Sigtuna, and Stockholm are currently being deployed towards the Swedish border with the Soviets.
    And both Sweden and Finland are building Future Worlds Improvements. Good Jobs, Gustav (Sweden) and Top Kek (Finland).

  narration: |-
    There shall be no more peace for Australia, according to the infamous Agent Em, who reports to the sub that Henry Parks of Australia is plotting against Mirwais Hotak (Afghanistan). Way to kick someone while they’re down, Parks.
    In other news, Sydney has fully recovered! With a massive 36 population, I believe this takes the prize as the second largest city in the world, only behind the Chilean city of Copiapo, which has reached the milestone of 40, and an actual pop higher than that!
    Also, looking around, the only Future Worlds units I see are Drone UAVs, which are located west of Brisbane, and a few Advanced Destroyers in the sea East of Sydney and Brisbane. Also, it seems, Parks may of caught the same bug as the Buccaneers, Iceland, and Sweden, and other civs, and is building an excess amount of Carriers. I do see quite a few floating around here!

  narration: |-
    Please Press “F” to pay respects for Harun Al-Rashid of Arabia, who has just been eliminated by Haile Selassie of Ethiopia. I’m not really good with Eulogies, and honestly, I can’t remember much about what Arabia did this whole game. Although, for what I do know, Arabia was a civ with really good tech (Look at the improvements by Jericho!), and did wage war upon Israel, but other than that, just kinda sat there, then got gangbanged by Ethiopia and The Boers, a truly terrifying combo, after Finnish Bombing raids! I honestly feel a little sorry for Harun, but in this game about spilling blood and nuking the shit out of millions of people, It’s honestly just the circle of life. Meanwhile, the last Arabian Helicopter tries to evacuate the last workers, and among them, Harun Al-Rashid himself. But apparently crossing the Red Sea is tougher in practice than thought.
    In the background, the the Armenian city of Artashat goes to Sparta
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene09.jpg
  narration: Yup, Artashat goes to Sparta. But Gyumri is Armenian again. Still, Armenia
    is stuck with three cities, with a grand total of 8 (land)  military units to
    defend. And Nearly half of these units are Artillery. I’d be worrying for Tiridates,
    Armenia Fans.

  narration: "We now get a look at Inuit-Occupied Canada, in which cities are already
    being annexed, like Winnipeg and Ottawa. This doesn’t look good, for, well, anyone
    really. Also, The Inuit have developed Organic Infantry, a monster of a unit.
    \nAlso of Note:\nVietnam and the Inuit have open borders, and the Trungs (Vietnam)
    are pulling a Boer and have begun filling Inuit lands with their own units. \nIceland
    has also developed Vertols ."

  narration: |-
    This is a HUGE Slide. So let’s dissect it as best we can.
    KOREA HAS XCOMS! This is a huge development for them, giving them a HUGE technological advantage over ALL their neighbors, even Australia. There may also be a few new units here, but I’m not 100% sure.
    Australia is currently plotting against the ghost of Lester B. Pearson, according to our beloved Agent Em.
    Mongolia has completed the Manhattan Project, something he had been striving to do since the Great Khanflict, when nukes were dropped on his own people.
    The Boers complete another wonder, which I can’t quite tell what it is at them moment.
- scene_number: "12"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene12.jpg
  narration: "Uh-oh. I think The Lion of the North Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden may
    be a little over his head on this one. Currently, he’s plotting against Ekeuhnick
    of the Inuit. \nAlso featured in this slide is Finnish Arsenal Ships, a valuable
    leg up on the Swedish. Also, Kekkonen has carpeted Icelandic France, as he had
    already done with the British Isles. Also, Drone UAVs are spotted in Finnish Territory."
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene13.jpg
  narration: And Possibly the absolute worst of all the current plotting, we have
    Henry Morgan plotting against the Last Legion. Though I doubt anything would come
    from this war, it’s still a terrifying prospect that anyone could destroy our
    favorite exiled unit, along with the Ashanti Pikeman, of course.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene14.jpg
  narration: "As previously stated, Genghis Khan has completed the Manhattan Project,
    and along with that I see Modern Armor and Helicopter Gunships floating around
    Mongolian Territory.\nMeanwhile: The Yakuts are actually building an army, so
    good for them. But still, half of their territory is home to Finnish overflow,
    much like Icelandic France and British Isles. \nSibir, Meanwhile, I believe has
    just rolled out their first Vertols, which can be seen below the city of Barnaul."
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene15.jpg
  narration: "So THAT’S what the boers Just built. Angelnet. One of the best wonders
    added by Future Worlds, it is “A Modern Red Fort. Doubling the strength of the
    already powerful Utility Fog Generator, this wonder will make every city a fortress”,
    according to u/TA_knight’s Future Worlds guide. This wonder will pretty much make
    them impenetrable. \nAlso, Remember what I said about Sydney being the second
    largest city in the world? Yeah, I lied apparently, as Mbanza-Kongo (Boers) is
    currently sitting at a pleasant 42 pop. That makes me claustrophobic just thinking
    about it."

  narration: |-
    The Boers and Arabia have peaced out, not that it matters anyway. All the Arabian clay is now Ethiopian clay, which is almost nearly carpeted. Yes, there are holes Ethiopia’s carpet, but not many, and most that’ll probably be filled within a part or two.
    Meanwhile, Hawaiian Peacekeepers struggle to get home and the infamous Drunken Mongolian Prophet stumbles towards Addis Ababa on horseback.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene17.jpg
  narration: "This time, The Lion is plotting against Leonidas (Sparta). This is certainly
    one Gustavus of Sweden could chew, but It would not be a walk in the park like
    the USSR would. \nMeanwhile, Brazilian Peacekeepers arrive in former Carthaginian
    Lands. Little late there, buds.\nAlso, The Buccs and Australia are apparently
    friends now, as they have open borders."
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18

  narration: |-
    Gyumri falls back to Sparta, which is a really bad sign for any Armenian Fans. (Yeah, all 3 of you)
    I only see 4 Armenian Land Units, and half are Artillery still. This is not looking good for my friends Tiridates.
    Also, Look in Persia, it’s tiny cities (Besides Persepolis), are all being surronded by units from other countries: Ethiopua, Mongolia, I even see a Sri Lankan AA Gun and a Afghani Paratrooper. Also, it seems the Hunnic Workers are now working for Darius (Persia).
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene19.jpg
  narration: "Three of the last Canadians, 2 Destroyers and a Caravel, can be seen
    on this slide, which look like they will be able to escape the evil clutches of
    the Inuit. \nI’m also going to call your attention to the Bucc’s navy. Currently,
    it is comprised of A shit ton of Carriers, a decent amount of Advanced Destroyers,
    a lot of Workers and Bazookas, and a few Nuclear Submarines and Battleships.  Nuclear
    Submarines & Battleships. That’s not a good thing for the Buccs, as most of their
    Naval rivals enjoy Cybersubs and Arsenal Ships, including Iceland and the Inuit."
- scene_number: "20"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene20.jpg
  narration: "While the Boers continue to fill up former Mali, other civs scramble
    for the living space of Former Morocco. Currently, Brazil and Australia are the
    main competitors. \nI really can’t see anything else in this slide of note other
    than the fact that Sparta may of just gotten Submarines. I really don’t know if
    that’s new or not. \n \nMeanwhile A Mali Artillery floats by the Pirate Island
    Cumana."

  narration: "Oh no, Tiridates of Armenia must be terrified now. Facing enemy DOWs
    by two massive superpowers, the USSR and Japan. \nActually, the last known time
    Japan declared war, was upon the Sioux, who then was eliminated by the Canadians
    who declared war later. Guys, who knows, Japan could be the CBR’s Grim Reaper
    to rival Sitting Jesus. In that case then, on this earth, The Devil has won, which
    is obvious was the massive amounts of deaths in this world so far, over 1 billion.\nArmenia
    still also has only two cities, Yerevan and Bukhara."
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene22.jpg
  narration: "Wow, The USSR declaration may be slightly more relevant than we think,
    as they currently have 3 units just north of the Armenian Capital, and possibly
    more on the way. They actually may be able to snipe the city after the Spartans
    put the effort into siegeing it. \nNow THAT, folks, is what the CBR is all about."

  narration: "As Spices are banned by the world congress, we also get a really nice
    few of South America.\nOf Note:\n-Chile Is recovering from the Australian War
    quite nicely, building up a semi-carpet and also starting to repair it’s navy.
    In a Brazilian DOW, the could probably hold the line pretty well, which is good
    for them. \n-Chile and Brazil have open borders, signifying friendship, although
    that may not last, as it looks like Chile has citadel bombed the Neuquen, which
    has probably angered Pedro of Brazil\n-.Chile and the Buccs also have open borders,
    and the Pirates, who barely have an army in their SA holdings, could end up being
    host to either an Aussie or Chilean guest army in the near future. \n-Brazil’s
    carpet is massive, but not super technologically advanced, as no Future Worlds
    units can be seen."

  narration: "Olives have were also nearly banned, and Tpang has graced us with a
    core shot of Sparta, which is probably celebrating with a leg day twice as long
    as normal as usual, as Leonidas’ empire must be filled with olives. \nHAVE A GOOD
    LEG DAY, SPARTANS!"
- scene_number: "25"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene25.jpg
  narration: Everybody loves to plot against The Last Legion and Ashanti Pikemen,
    as that’s who nearly every civ seems to want to eliminate. I pity the poor units
    who who float around on bodies of water, not doing anything with their lives,
    other than maybe a history exhibition every once and awhile.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene26.jpg
  narration: Yerevan is taking damage, but Leonidas has only brought Helicopters to
    the siege. If Stalin could just move his Artillery, and get on of his other two
    units in there, he could possibly snipe the city. I could only imagine the rejoice
    of USSR fans everyone, and also the memes that would be sure to come out of this.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene27.jpg
  narration: "Apparently, Henry Parks of Australia is plotting against Leonidas of
    Sparta. He does have those units in Marrrrracco (I think that’s what the Buccs
    are calling it :/), so he may be able to take a city or two, but it’d probably
    not be permanent. \nBut holy crap, this Digger Carpet is terrifying. Sure, they’re
    a little weak in comparison to what most other powers are wielding, and he doesn’t
    really have many ships floating around, though there are some. Sometimes though,
    Quantity beats Quality."

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene28.jpg
  narration: "Henry Morgan of the Buccaneers is also getting his plotting pants on!
    He seems to be plotting against Samuel Houston of Texas, hoping to get a new exclave
    called Arrrrrstin, I can’t see Texas putting up much of a fight, but again, the
    only Pirate ships I see in this slide are Carriers and Nuclear Submarines. \nThe
    Buccs are in the same predicament as Australia, a naval civ with outdated naval
    technology. But, unlike the Aussies, the Buccs don’t have a science output growing
    exponentially, so I’m not so sure about the rum drinking Pirates chances."
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part61-scene29.jpg
  narration: "SPARTA HAS PEACED OUT WITH ARMENIA! RIGHT WHEN TIRIDATES WAS ABOUT TO
    KEEL OVER AND DIE! \nHonestly Leonidas, that was really stupid. Yes, you would
    get the elimination penalty, but you would still get a capital, a valuable thing
    to have no a days, and more clay to carpet! It really wasn’t smart.\nRIP Spartan
    Yerevan\nRIP Soviet Snipe of Yerevan."

  narration: "A FUTURE WORLDS WONDER NOT BUILT BY THE BOERS? I DIDN’T KNOW THAT WAS
    POSSIBLE! \nYou heard it here first, folks! The Vietnamese have built a wonder
    called the Citadel Station, a wonder that gives… oh I don’t know, but Tpang will
    tell me in the next slide anyway. \nAnyway, Vietnam’s carpet is still really scary
    and really big, and it seems that Vietnam is right on the edge of getting all
    the new, fancy Future Worlds units, so good for them."

    Ah-ha. The Citadel Station is a wonder that improves the yields of Scientist and Engineer specialists, more specifically, it gives +2 Science and Gold from scientists, and +2 Gold and Production from engineers. A nice wonder, though compared to other wonders *cough Skynet cough*. It’s not so great. But it’s still a nice thing to have I guess.
    Meanwhile, let’s take a moment to appreciate how fucking awesome that art is for the Citadel Station, shall we?

  narration: |-
    It seems like Henry Morgan has finally decided to train his workers in scrubbing Fallout. And since all the world’s powers are not afraid to use nukes if need be, this is a good thing for Henry, as rebuilding infrastructure will be critical in the coming parts, to be able to keep churning out units to fill in the holes made by war.
    Meanwhile More Aussies Units are also being shipped into the area through the port of Rabat.

  narration: Agent Semiramis actually received some real intel, and The Lion of the
    North has declared war upon Ekeuhnick of the Inuit. Now, I really cannot tell
    if this was just a Boldness flair showing it’s ugly head here, or the beginning
    of a coalition against the Inuit for the elimination of Canada. A SOPA-esk coalition
    could really hurt the Inuit, especially if civs like Iceland, Yakutia, and the
    Buccaneers join in. Even Mexico and Texas could play a role in a coalition like
    that.
- scene_number: "34"

  narration: "If a SOPA revival against the Inuit does occur, there are a few civs
    that most likely not join in, like Australia, Vietnam, Mexico, and the Blackfoot,
    who are all share open borders with Ekeuhnick and his White Walkers. \nAlso, It
    seems that the beginnings of a branch of the Ice Sheet Fleet is being begun on
    the Atlantic, as evident by two Cybersubs.\nAnd even more former Canadian cities
    are being annexed, the newest being Halifax, Fort Rouille, and Kitchener (Great
    Name, Pearson)."

  narration: "The Boers have completed yet another Wonder, the Digital Emancipation.
    Which provides Production, Science, and Culture based on information era buildings
    within the empire. The Future Worlds guide, u/TA_knight, said he had no idea on
    how this works. (Thanks for the help, TA.) My guess is that you get one of each
    in every city per building that the Future Worlds mod introduces in that city.
    This could be very powerful in large empires like the Boers, Sibir, Inuit, Vietnam,
    and especially Australia. But the wonder has gone to the Boers. \nAlso of note,
    the Brazilian Units floating towards Boer territory."

    The Kimberley has completed the Manhattan Project, Following Mongolia’s lead from earlier this part. The now rump state of the Kimberley had a chance to do stuff again and take out Sri Lanka, but the damn Aussies intervened and took them over instead. That’s probably the fate for the Kimberley until Vietnam or Australia comes and conquers them. But hey, as of now, the Kimberley are friends with Henry Parks (Australia), so all he needs to worry about is Vietnam.
    Also, the Kimberley have a workable Krakatoa, which is nice, I guess.

  narration: Apparently, Declaring war upon the Inuit isn’t enough for The Lion (Sweden),
    still hasn’t had enough, and is currently plotting against Napoleon. Sweden, I
    really hate to break it to you, but France has been dead for a while now, and
    all that currently remains are a few units in Spartan territory.

  narration: 'Henry Morgan of the Buccaneers is currently plotting against Leonidas
    of Sparta. That would be another really good war for the Buccs, and they could
    easily pick up another two capitals: Rome and Carthage with their navy, and well
    as a few other cities. that would give them a really strong lead in the “Who’s
    Technically Winning”, with a total count of 8 capitals, if I’m correct.'

  narration: "The Soviet Sieges of Yerevan isn’t going particularly well, but they
    have Paratroopers now! Which would’ve helped them… when Armenia had more land
    and was completely empty… \nI still have hopes for them though.\nAnyway, Sparta
    has annexed three cities: Hebron, Gymuri, and Artashat (That is really fun to
    type. Seriously), leaving only Jerusalem and Tigranocerta unannexed from the Armenian
    Conquests."

  narration: "The newest rump state on the cylinder, Armenia, has decided to declare
    war on another, Tibet!  \nHonestly, there’s not much to say here about either
    civ other than that Tibet is seriously behind in tech, sporting riflemen. Although,
    Tibet does have more military units than Armenia.\nSo, let’s take this opportunity
    to look at the Vietnamese army! It’s quite large, and with divisions in civs all
    of the cylinder, Vietnam has one of the farthest reaches of power in the CBR."

  narration: Tibet, seeing the diplomatic middle finger that is the Armenian DOW,
    declares peace with another Diplomatic Middle Finger, the Yakutian DOW on them.
    Honestly, nothing came out of this war, not like anything could’ve, but it gives
    us an excuse to get a shot of the Yakut Core. They have a shit ton of units, but
    most of them are workers. Apparently, Yakutia is building are carpet of civilians,
    much like Tiridates of Armenia did… before he was nearly swallowed by Sparta.

  narration: KOREA HAS DECLARED A WAR! On Hawaii.. But no need to fear! Korea has
    XCOMs, which will probably allow for Korea to eliminate Hawaii. Also, Robot Infantry
    has appeared in Korea, just south eastwards of Seoul. Korea is actually looking
    good right here, and may be able to damage on any of their neighbors, except for
    maybe Vietnam. The only reason I saw the could do damage on Australia is because
    Japan is separated from the rest of the Aussie’s carpet. But Korea will have to
    declare war fast.

  narration: "Here’s the last of Hawaii, the island of Kaneohe. Korea will probably
    be able to land some XCOMs, and do some damage. If they can get some more ships
    down here besides a single Submarine.\nAlso, for those who care, Persia has join
    Armenia in declaring war upon the Tibetan Menace. \n“LONG LIVE MAO!” Darius of
    Persia and Tiridates of Armenia scream. They then probably throw back a shot."

    I doubt they’ll be able to do anything about it. \nI think Tpang was also trying
    to show off the Siberian Vertols, but I already covered that."

    HOLY FUCKING SHIT GUYS. HYPEEEEEEEEE! EVERYBODY THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE FUTURE. THIS MUST ALSO BE THE REASON WHY TURNS ARE SO LONG. VIETNAM HAS DECLARED WAR UPON HENRY PARKS AND AUSTRALIA. THIS IS HONESTLY A WAR THAT COULD GO EITHER WAY. GUYS THIS WAR WILL BE BLOODY! I EXPECT NUKES TO FLY! I EXPECT CITIES TO BURN! I EXPECT MASS GENOCIDE! I EXPECT A NEW CIVBALL IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE DRAWN! HOW THIS WAR TURNS OUT COULD CHANGE EVERYTHING.
    HHHHHYYYYYPPPPPEEEEE!!!!!
    Alright guys, I think I may of broken my caps lock button….
    Anyway, this slide only shows us the Vietnamese core, which doesn’t give us much information on what has already happened in this war.

  narration: "In the Vietnamese city of Iloilo, Drone Fighters prepare  for war, as
    do Bombers, and even Nuclear Bombs. While no shots have been fired in this war
    yet, rest assured, they will. There will be many, many shots, and many many deaths.
    \nAlright, analysis mode activate.\nVietnam seems to have the technological advantage
    here, with Advanced Destroyers, and well, not having Diggers. Australia, however,
    has the numerical advantage, with clearly more units in the immediate distance.
    Although, Vietnam’s core is not as far away as Australia’s so that is another
    advantage for Vietnam. \nMy question is, will Korea get involved? That would be
    huge for either side of the conflict, with XCOMs in play, that could mean all
    the distance."

    Here’s some damage! Shots have been fired, and My Son is at 0 health, the Aussies cities of Mataram (Another great name), Ambron and Whangarei have also taken massive damage. This war is going to be really good. I can feel it. And Diggers are closing in on My Son, and this war is already favoring Australia.
    Anyway, I think Vietnam just got Mech Artillery, so good for them.

  narration: "Bombs are being stockpiled on either side, and the Cities of Manila
    (Vietnam), Legaspi (should be a Spartan City) and Zamboang-something (Australia)
    have all taken Damage, and all could flip soon. Australia also has acquired Drone
    Fighters, so neither civ has an advantage in the air. \nAlso, the Blackfoot have
    chosen sides, letting Australian troops move through Olongapo. Honestly, Crowfoot
    probably only did this to appease a civ so much more powerful than him, and could
    have him killed. \nAustralia has embarked many of their units, but are at a distinct
    lack of actual ships, which will seriously hurt them in the long run.\nI’m laughing
    right now, just wondering how the power rankers are going to rank these two civs."

  narration: Both the Vietnamese cities of Cebu and Iloilo are in the red, and Iloilo
    may flip, which would be terrible for Vietnam, with all of the planes in that
    city. However, luckily for Vietnam, All I see in the area is Australian Embarked
    units, Carriers, Subs, 1 Destroyer and 1 Privateer, so there’s not really much
    the Henry Parks (Australia) can do by means of capturing cities.

    Anyway, the Australian Core, everybody….
    Sorry, I had to go cry in a corner for a few minutes, because that is scary as shit! All of this is currently on it’s way to the Vietnam front. If the Trungs want to make it out with a win, they need to work fast, take some cities, then peace out before all of this shit gets there. That’s seriously the only way I see the Trungs (Vietnam) winning. Although, I could see them holding this off though.

  narration: We are also greeted with a shot of Australian Polynesia. This shot is
    actually only 20 tiles or so to the East, but still shows more of that carpet.
    Although, in this slide I see Advanced Destroyers and Caravels. Good job Parks!
    Remembering those Melee ships!

  narration: This is the full extent of the Australian carpet… almost spanning the
    entire Pacific ocean. This is honestly nightmare inducing, and I know I’ll be
    feeling it tonight. Just seeing these slides makes me question the Trungs. Do
    they really think they can beat this? I’m doubtful, but It can be done. I really
    like Vietnam, and it’s 100% sure that this war will make or break them. Either
    securing them a top 3 position, or kicking them out of the top ten. As for Australia,
    I don’t see them leaving the top 10, they’re just so large, but this war could
    possibly hurt them quite a bite, depending on who else joins the war and how stupid
    or smart the AIs are.

    scary. Over 500 million people in the Boer Empire. \nAnyway. Welcome to the Stats!
    \nThe top 5 in pop remain the same in population. Boers lead with 528 million,
    Australia comes second with nearly 300 million, and Vietnam comes 3 with just
    over 200 million."

    the Boers. Also, Vietnam have 450k or less soldiers than Australia the civ they
    just declared war on. Smart, Trungs, Smart.

  narration: The Inuit are only 1 city behind in city count compared to the Aussie
    Empire, who’s sitting at 103. I imagine that the Inuit’s Tech Cost is through
    the roof right now, though. This gives civs like Korea and Iceland a chance to
    catch up some to the Inuit.

    The Boers are currently only 2 techs away from the end of the tech tree, which is crazy.
    Other things to note:
    -Iceland now has a 1 tech lead over Korea to become third in technology.
    -A three way tie for 5th in technology is between Vietnam, Australia, and Sweden.
    -Sweden has overtaken Finland in tech
    -A Dead civ is a tech leader….

    according to Tpang: “I started recording the next part And then I was like DAMN”\nWell,
    then I got to this slide and went “Damn!”\nBoth Finland and Sweden has declared
    war upon the USSR! This is not a war, this is a race between to civs to see who’s
    faster and sending troops into slaughter millions of people. . \nWe’ve been saying
    this for quite a few parts that both Sweden and Finland has to declare war on
    the USSR to get some free clay, and they finally did it… together. \nDon’t mind
    Darius, he’s irrelevant\nAnd this also happened the turn after Vietnam declared
    war on Australia. \nThe Culling is upon us folks. \nAnd to think I was just hyping
    up a Soviet Snipe of Yerevan a few slides ago. lol ."

  narration: "And here we can see why this war was probably started, because the Soviets
    citadeled the shit out of Finland, and Top Kek didn’t like that. Well, at least
    Finland won’t be 100% border gore anymore with the USSR out of the way. There’s
    literally nothing they can do here but try not to die next part.Kiev is already
    down to 0 health by Finnish Bombing runs, and one Paratruuper could do the job.\nHonestly
    I feel this is a suicide, considering all of those Citadels. Stalin probably feels
    guilty of Napoleon’s death, and also brought out his notes he took so long ago
    in a lecture by Alexios Komnenos of Byzantium. Stalin, too, wants “Death By Finland”
    on his tombstone.\nI actually feel really bad for u/Ignus_, who just put a lot
    of effort to make a new USSR civball for the power rankings. \nAnd with that,
    Ladies and Gentlemen, I leave you. I had a really great time narrating for you
    guys, and despite it being a little rushed, I think the narration still turned
    out good enough. This has been one hell of a part, with three new relevent wars
    being started, and then Sweden showing he has some huge ass balls by declaring
    war upon the Inuit. And then the Trungs showing Gustavus (Sweden) that they have
    the biggest balls by declaring on Australia. And they’re females. I betcha that
    all the Male leaders on the Cylinder won’t feel very great about themselves tonight.
    Anyway, I hope the USSR and Hawaii don’t just roll over and die, and put up a
    decent fight like Morocco did. (F). This part may of been pretty good, but I do
    know one thing. Part 62 is going to do down into the history books… or maybe the
    Aussie-Vietnamese war will end up being like the Great Khanflict…\npls tpang don’t
    do dis. we want blood.\nAnyway, I’ve been u/_xSyracuse, and I hope you all have
    a wonderful evening/morning/afternoon, wherever on this sphere we totally non-digital
    people call home."
