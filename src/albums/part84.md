    Greetings and salutations to all! Welcome to Part 84 of the Civilization Battle Royale. This is Coiot accompanying you on this massive homecoming. As most of you know, it has been nearly 11 months since the last album, and much has changed since then.
    To start us off, I will be going through a quick preview of the action before we procede to the five turns we will be running for Part 84. For those already not well acquainted with all the changes in Mk 2.1, please visit the latest Megathread to catchup before proceeding.

  narration: The journey begins anew. In view is the submarine’s home new home, with
    our arctic mountain fortress having moved a few tiles to the left to escape the
    prying eyes of the Boers. Come get settled in fello sub mates, the view should
    be quite familiar to you.

  narration: "Let’s begin by address the the three notifications on the screen. First
    is the reactivation of Armenia’s unique ability due to the religion reset. Their
    UA converts Armenia to the first religion founded in the game, and furthermore,
    they will be gaining 33% of the faith produced by the founder. As we can see onscreen,
    they immediately gain the pantheon bonus God of the Sea, which may not be the
    best given their geography, but should be quite welcome for the Armenian war effort.
    \nAs far as the conflict in view, Armenia has wasted no time in engaging Finland.
    Tiridates’ troops surround their former city Yervantashat, and prepare the siege.
    No damage upon this first initial startup turn but their Great Musicians are there
    to keep morale high."

  narration: |-
    We now see which religion Armenia has responded to. Australia establishes in Tokyo Catholicism. A very curious choice given Australia’s known preferences. One could be tempted to say that their troops abroad in Meso America could have influenced this decision, but this reboot is devoid of such religious history. Important to note too is that this means Australia has God of the Sea, which should be a blessing for all of those one tile islands.
    In any case, this has been a good excuse to quickly show off the Inuit campaign in the Japanese main islands. A contingent of cybersubs and arsenal ships are prepared to bombard Tokyo and Wakayama. Will the new holy city see a change of hands so soon?

  narration: |-
    Back in Kruger’s favored Future Worlds wonder filled city of Klerksdorp, we find the monument the Boer’s have erected in the former sight of the Pholus Mutagen’s primary hive cluster. A much welcomed change to non-Boer fans, the absence of the Mutagen comes as the only nerf introduced in Mk 2.1.
    This northwest region of Boer Africa also shows how sparse their military distribution has been left after the OCP war. Indeed, the robot horde has all but short circuited after the pirates spilled their rum on their way out. Not to worry Boer fans, their newly researched replacements are incoming.

  narration: A shot of the British Isles, Ingolfur Arnarson’s private domain. Quite
    a peaceful landscape, as this part of the cylinder has not seen war since complete
    Viking domination. A not so lovely view is the ocean, which CBR fans may find
    horror inducing by scanning through the carrier infested navy that congest the
    waters. Iceland currently leads in capitals, with a total of 9, and has indeed
    been met with great fortune the previous 800+ turns. We are all curious though
    what war at home will spell for their destiny.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene07.jpg
  narration: We visit Iceland’s neighbor Sweden and find the sleepy giant in quite
    decent shape. Sweden is currently not in war, and their unit composition is definitely
    more attractive than their counterparts. That is, what they have stationed at
    the borders. Both Sweden itself, and their Central European territory, is quite
    empty. Gustavus Adolphus would be wise to continue rebuilding their former carpet
    of troops across his empire, as Europe may soon become the next area of contention.

  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene08.jpg
  narration: A shot of the Boer core and their capital Pretoria shows that the mechanized
    menace is still indeed in full military production. Reinforcements are on their
    way north as soon as next turn is clicked.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene09.jpg
  narration: We now turn to Finland, and oh boy what a concerning view. Finland is
    presently at war with the most civs, at 7 and they share borders with 5 of them.  Chief
    amongst those opponents are the Boers and Iceland. A quick scan to the countryside
    reveals they have all the Future Worlds improvements to maintain the war effort,
    but once again Urho Kekkonen on the cusp of overextension. In more ways than one!
    Not that Finland fans would want it any other way.
- scene_number: "10"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene10.jpg
  narration: "Let us look at this screenshot from left to right. Outside Jerusalem
    we find SpartanShitposter leading the Sparta’s finest against Finland. Conditions
    of the reboot finds Hebron back at full HP, but Finland only has one hovertank
    and three aircraft here as its only defense. With the aforementioned attention
    Finland has to give elsewhere, the Spartans must be feeling confident. \nDown
    the middle we see the rest of Tiridates’ tripartite state. We also see Vietnam’s
    far western stretch into Eurasia. Even here we find that there are drones at every
    corner keeping a watchful eye for the Trung sisters. This is a vital front for
    Vietnam, and they will need better military compositions than this to make progress
    against Sibir."
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene11.jpg
  narration: Now a full shot of Sparta. In the previous few albums, the exiles in
    Dvin were able make a triumphant comeback and capture Epidauros and Jerusalem.
    The latter in particular was worth all the extraordinary effort required.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene12.jpg
  narration: Finland’s refugee haven of Batticaloa temporarily finds itself back in
    pristine shape. The Afghan remnants have surrounded the city with their camps,
    but Sri Lanka next door wants to reclaim their lost city. Time will tell if this
    estranged community remain willing to shield their hosts.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene13.jpg
  narration: "A look at the western front of the Sibir / Vietnam war. The mountain
    range here is cleanly dividing the two powerhouses, but the Sibir side lies in
    smoke. However, the Vietnamese side seems equally empty with fighting units. Right
    before the reboot, Sibir launched a few nukes around Kandahar, and it has left
    quite a dent in Vietnam’s frontier garrisons. \nAlso something we should point
    out in this slide is the curious case of a certain teleporting Ashanti pikeman
    in the top center section of the screenshot. We ourselves don’t quite know why,
    perhaps some bizarre open borders interaction, but it seems Kruger has thrown
    open a portal in time, and has flung them into the future. In this timeline, they
    find themselves lost in totally foreign territory. Lucky for Ashanti fans tho,
    they are not at war with Sibir in the reboot. Not so fortunate is the fact that
    a certain other popular refugee unit also perished around these parts."
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene14.jpg
  narration: "A better view of the Sibir side of Central Asia and we find that the
    worker army of Kuchum Khan is ready to repair all the damage done by Vietnam’s
    bombardment. Although, what is supposed to be their production core seems all
    but empty of troops. Not a good sign as others may have hungry eyes on this clay.
    Lucky for them that Finland has its hands, and toes, busy elsewhere. \nNear the
    upper right we find a Chinese Knight. Standing on a Communications Array perhaps
    they wish to phone home."
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene15.jpg
  narration: Now a complete look at Mongolia’s core. Say what you want about Mongolia,
    but the days of cramming every single tile with horse archers are long gone. Mongolia
    boasts a very attractive army. Not as big as others, but this looks very solid
    indeed. They have time to rebuild after having first held Yakutia in a long stalemate,
    and then a victory march with the Koreans inside the disgraced empire’s interior.
    Genghis Khan would do well to take this time to asses the situation and prepare
    for any opportunity to continue their upwards progress.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene16.jpg
  narration: The rest of Mongolia is in view here, and so is Finland’s satellite of
    Khoro. The city sure takes a sizable portion of this region, and within its borders
    are quite a few useful resources. Finland better beware, their garrison is tiny
    compared to the Mongolian horde.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene17.jpg
  narration: What many are waiting for, the Yakutian holdout city of Beryozovo. Mongolian
    and Korean forces could not break into the frozen fortress, but all the Brazilian
    peacekeepers are now in range of the city. The city is now back at full HP though,
    will the Brazilians be able to deliver enough firepower?
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene18.jpg
  narration: The full stretch of what remains of Sri Lanka. They have made the Indian
    subcontinent’s interior their comfy home, but they are surrounded on all sides
    by their Vietnamese overlords. Can they reach a similar deal as the Tibetans have
    with Vietnam, or is this a meal for another day? Sri Lanka will surely not make
    it easy if there is conflict in the horizon, as their military is taking shape,
    and their unit composition biases are quite good. We hope to return here with
    keen interest soon.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene19.jpg
  narration: The Kimberley Antarctic colonies. So far from home, but so safe from
    danger too! In view is the newly designated capital-in-exile Wulungarra. The Kimberley
    administration will now surely have cooler heads in charge here, especially after
    the brazenly heated decision to invade Japan.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene20.jpg
  narration: "The Jewel of the Trung’s crown, Tibet continues to look after the valleys
    of the plateau’s interior. Viewers will now see that Tibet’s military has been
    strengthened by its devotion to freedom in the form of six brand new Foreign Legion
    units. Quite a boon for their defenses, as their value has multiplied many times
    over. \nAll around Tibet, we continue to see the endless sea of drones. All the
    skies around the Himalayas are congested with their traffic."
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene21.jpg
  narration: A return back to Yakutia and the Brazilian peacekeepers. It is still
    the same turn, so this just serves as a reminder. Of note though are the Finnish
    troops scattered about. Surely Kekkonnen could use them elsewhere in their southern
    reaches.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene22.jpg
  narration: A look at satellite city Turfan, which has only Mobile SAMs for company.
    What a lonely view in my opinion. This screenshot also gives us the first decent
    look at Korean territory. All of this former Yakutian land is still being redeveloped,
    but Korea seems to have order all settled. One can hope they can capitalize on
    safely regrouping their armies as well.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene23.jpg
  narration: One can also hope they are paying good attention at the events happening
    just opposite of their mainland. Korea has quite a good navy here. Some carriers
    here and there but not too any worrisome degree. With the Inuit applying pressure
    on Australia’s far east holdings, Korea can be the one to benefit by coming in
    at the right time and snatching it all for themselves.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene24.jpg
  narration: Our first look in Southeast Asia and right in the center is the Blackfoot
    vacation paradise of Olongapo. Not a well kept secret, but this curious satellite
    lies right in between two superpowers. On the Vietnamese side of the region, we
    see more drones and a mostly cyber sub navy patrolling the waters. On the Australian
    side, there appears to be an equal number of workers to that military units. Australia
    is all but distracted on other fronts. One wonders if war will return to these
    islands sometime soon in the future.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene25.jpg
  narration: Oh Australia, perhaps the most polarizing of remaining civs. The sub
    may be divided on their opinion of the Oceania superpower, but this image is quite
    a show of force. That is of course, if you can ignore all the carriers scattered
    about. Before the reboot, Henry Parkes was content with keeping such a large defense
    force in the mainland. The next few turns will see if units here will be coming
    to the aid against the war effort in the rim of the Pacific.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene26.jpg
  narration: The Chukotkian region of the Inuit’s empire finally knows peace, but
    the presence of a few Australian units here will mean some skirmishes are inevitable.
    This land was a hard earned prize for the Inuit, who fought one of the longest
    ongoing conflicts in the simulation’s history to finally consolidate it whole.
    Once these cities are built up, it could be the springboard from which the Inuit
    can make progress into Asia.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene27.jpg
  narration: Now onto the Inuit core. Everything is advanced and shiny here, and not
    only because of the reflection of all the ice! Quite a number of Psionic and Bionic
    troopers lie in wait and ready to be deployed. If only there was a hostile target
    here for them to actually find use with.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene28.jpg
  narration: A target like this one here. The Blackfoot homeland looks better than
    ever now, and with slightly more breathing room. There are enough paratroopers
    here to make Brazil, Finland, and Armenia jealous. Not that Crowfoot will be moving
    these troops elsewhere. It is in the best interest to keep the Inuit intimidated.
    Who knows how the reboot may have affected their relations.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene29.jpg
  narration: The Caribbean at last! My heart swells and my pride rejoices. Henry Morgan
    may now just have to settle for the Buccaneer core for supplies of rum, but there
    are still quite a few pirate captains willing to fly the black flag with him.
    The navy is nearly gone, but there are more pirates ready to take the seas. What
    remains of the fleet is moving towards Nassau. Sadly for them the city is back
    to full HP, but lucky for them Australia will now be all but distracted to focus
    on these trouble makers. A storm is coming, and it screams Ayylamo.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene30.jpg
  narration: "A little bit to the West we see more of Australia’s Meso American colonies,
    and also what remains of Texas. Laredo is the biggest city now in the region,
    and they seem to be rebuilding just fine given what they have to work with. It
    is unknown whether the Hawaiian peacekeepers will continue to be an asset for
    them, or if they are getting in the way. \nThe Australians for that matter are
    bracing for the coming Inuit offensive. Already some XCOMs have made the jump
    over and have begun to rouse a ruckus. The defense seems able for now, but there
    is no telling if there will be any reinforcements for the Australians anytime
    soon. \nFurther northwest, we see a glimpse of the Blackfoot’s newly acquired
    nuclear wasteland. More paratroopers mark the dominance they now display here.
    If it was not for lowly Olongapo in Southeast Asia, the Blackfoot might be tempted
    to make easy gains here by declaring on Australia. Surely most viewers would find
    it to be a worthy trade."
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene31.jpg
  narration: Often ignored South America, now all but in Brazilian control. Here we
    see the Brazilian core, and quite a massive land army assembled. Ever since mini-Pedro
    came to big Pedro’s life things have been going oh so well. Australia stands to
    lose their South American trophies to this might.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene32.jpg
  narration: A look back to Sparta. Quite a contrast in color, I dare say. Not much
    more to point out here as it remains the same initial turn. Although, I can have
    you direct your eyes at the Boer worker’s transforming North Africa. I’m afraid
    not much of a desert will remain soon enough.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene33.jpg
  narration: Proper assessment now of the detachment of the Ice Shelf Fleet that the
    Inuit have here aimed at Australia’s Japan. The Inuit can cause much damage, and
    with great speed, if they use these units wisely. There are a few melee warships
    where as well, we can only hope they will be used correctly and on the right time.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene34.jpg
  narration: "The former Hawaiian homeland. Not much of a paradise now, and war has
    returned to the islands. The Inuit have already landed XCOMs outside Hilo and
    are poised to take it soon. Their navy is also just within range. \nBlackfoot
    cities flank this region. Again I’m left to wonder if the Blackfoot would do good
    in taking advantage of the current situation."
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene35.jpg
  narration: Back in Nassau we can see the Inuit are ready to lend the pirates a hand.
    More of kind gesture for now, but this screenshots shows that there is not much
    to defend these cities from the pirates if and when they can spill forth from
    the great canal.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene36.jpg
  narration: A better appraisal of the mismatch awaiting the Australians here as the
    defenses don’t seem at all adequate here for what the Buccs and Brazilians will
    soon be unleashing upon them. Brazil is not quite ready to begin attacking in
    mass, but their odds are looking very good here. Although, Belize may be in trouble
    of flipping.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene37.jpg
  narration: Oh. Here is the Garbage Patch remnants. Outside Hervey Bay and not Tulum.
    Not the best deployment orders Parkes, but it will have to do. Further north it
    may look dire for the Australians, but this screenshots shows that Brazil’s Incan
    holdings are in equal danger if the coasts remain so empty. The ever persistent
    diggers are coming!
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene38.jpg
  narration: An even further front in Australia’s Pacific Rim defense. Concepcion
    is surrounded, and Brazil has the paratroopers and XCOMs to swamp all their open
    tiles.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene39.jpg
  narration: A return to Central Asia, and the obstacle that is the Finland satellite
    of Tyumen to Vietnam’s push into Sibir territory. Tyumen bottle necks troops to
    Bamda, and the reboot has Sibir looking pretty good here. Vietnam needs to get
    those drones to the front right away.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene40.jpg
  narration: Iceland’s newly acquired Balkans last part have all been healed up. Their
    forces are still not pushing together, but this will surely be the meeting place
    for all the troops coming from Iceland’s production centers. Already a few paratroopers
    go forth to Iceland’s prize, and probably true objective in this war, Constantinople.
    If Iceland can claim that city, they will be the first with a double digit count
    of capitals. Currently a great achievement for the Vikings.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene41.jpg
  narration: "Our first look at the religion overview. Australia has picked up two
    production bonuses, and both will serve them well in the future. That is of course
    if Catholicism can spread down to their territory. They do gain the pantheon bonus,
    but with Tokyo tucked in the far reaches of their domain, it may not be likely
    their homeland will get to benefit from any further bonuses. Armenia having converted
    may just spread more faith than anything from Japan. \nWe wondered why Australia
    was so quick to getting the religion right away. For those wishing for an answer
    it is because of the religious wonders built by the Kimberley in Rubibi that have
    given them the edge. Those bizarre wonder choices have come back to baffle us
    once more."
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene42.jpg
  narration: The Boer Indian Ocean. This area was the sight of a brief scare by Australia
    not too long ago further south. There is quite an empty ocean here. Perhaps room
    to grow after the robot armies are rebuilt in the mainland.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene43.jpg
  narration: Herat, city at the center of the Vietnam / Sibir war. Also sight of many
    nuclear drops. Amongst them could have been what extinguished the flame of the
    beloved Legion. We will never know exactly.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene44.jpg
  narration: A view of Hanoi, and the rest of Vietnam’s primary production clusters
    just up north. Drones fill the skies in all directions. How different things may
    have been if Vietnam had focused on different techs as Vietnam’s unit biases in
    their mod file is quite different to what is on display.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene45.jpg
  narration: Say hello to our Babylonian spy division. Some returning names, like
    the lovely Em, but also fresh new ones. We waste no time and send them all off
    to have a look-see at some of the leaders of the simulation. We might get something
    juicy from them, or we might be shared their pipe dreams. Hopefully more of the
    former.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene46.jpg
  narration: As astute viewers have seen, we are now finally at turn 2, and Iceland
    here has made their first move. More paratroopers converge on Constantinople,
    and XCOM are not too far behind them. The city of Elis takes damage from the Finnish
    aircraft stationed nearby, but Finland has no units to do anything about it at
    this time.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene47.jpg
  narration: Back in Tibet, and still no new religion. Maybe the faith output is still
    not strong enough, even after our palace modification. Some may notice that Vietnam
    has indeed moved some units towards Sibir, but quite a long way for them to go
    to reach the flashpoints.
- scene_number: "48"

    the required distance in no time.

  narration: Let us focus on the top half of the screenshot. In the upper left we
    see that the Boers are moving a number of Mobile SAMs northwards. They may have
    run out of hovertank parts as there are only two of them here. Now in the upper
    right we see Batticaloa has taken damage right away. Also of note is that a Sri
    Lankan bazooka is already at the port, and a Finnish carrier was sitting there
    just a turn ago. It seems the Boers are prepared to give them a hand in this fight.

    in one turn. Yerevan is surrounded by hovertanks, and at first glance the Armenian
    units they dispatched seem to be in disarray after their battle lines were breached.
    \nThey are not the only ones dismayed though as I don’t see Spartanshitposter
    anywhere! The infantry units are there untouched, but the hoplite has vanished.
    The Finnish hovertanks left elsewhere, so it appears the aircraft stationed in
    Hebron found it best to take him out rather than focus on more pressing high value
    targets. I am sad, truly. So much effort on my part for nothing, ;A;"

  narration: Still the same turn, but a better look at Batticaloa and Sri Lanka’s
    attack. If the Boers continue to support them, they could be able to reclaim their
    city after so much time under Finland’s control. The Afghan refugees are not being
    cooperative though. To the north, drones begin to move to the frontline.

  narration: We return to Beryozovo to find that the Yakuts have taken the fight to
    Brazil and are weakening the incoming paratroopers. Pedro also seems to have ordered
    half of the units here to return home rather than to focus on the target 10 tiles
    away. The way things look, Yakutia fans should be safe in feeling like they will
    join the other rump states in perpetual isolation.

    Inuit’s only port in the region, Mililani Mauka, has instantly been taken down
    to zero HP. No units anywhere capable of clipping the city, so the Inuit must
    be content in having the bombs continue to rain down here. \nAlso in this screenshot,
    we get our first good look at what remains of Hawaii. Kaneohe seems rather healthy,
    at an incredible 34 population. There truly is always more ohana waiting. Talk
    about fish in the sea."

  narration: Quite a contrast than the previous image, in this screenshot we find
    that it is Brazil needing to bolster its defenses. Vilcas stands to change hands
    next turn, but losing Vitcos and Corihuayrachina would help the Australians create
    a beachhead. They have been proven to quite good and holding their own from such
    positions elsewhere in the Americas.

    bazooka. The city itself has also not taken less damage. It still appears it healed

    taking the most of this opportunity. Vilcas and Huamanga stand at not HP left
    and there are several melee units in range to raise the true green flag. Corihuayrachina
    does continue to take fire from Australian forces, and you can see a digger just
    outside in his natural habitat, the inhospitable battle-worn beaches. One last

    do all the fighting. Although, with Boer Mobile SAMs are moving in, Leonidas needs
    to think fast or lose out on some easy clay. \nIn Yerevan the situation is more
    desperate. Armenia’s entire military scrambles to secure objectives, but they
    may have sent out far too many deep behind enemy lines instead of focusing on
    any one target. If Finland could spare but a few XCOMs this fight may be well
    over for them."

    here without context. Parkes has the numbers here to scare away the pirates and
    keep the Brazilians at bay, but they are not much use here in the open waters.
    One hopes it was all the units stationed outside Hervey Bay we saw earlier moving
    in.

    waste no second, and gush forth again onto the Pacific. Their cities may not be
    in the best shape, but many pirate captains have full crews intact to start terrorizing
    the Australian ports. Further north the Inuit also bring the shock and awe with
    their XCOMs. Uxmal looks to be their target to divide and conquer.

    Good yet? Humanga and Vilcas remain in Australian control while the diggers are
    victorious down in Corihuayrachina. Brazil has more than enough units here to
    settle the fighting and be moving onwards to Tulum, but they are all positioned
    strangely (with for example a railgun blocking any Brazilian attempt at capturing
    Vilcas). The defenders have been given too much of an opportunity.

  narration: Sitting aside the fact that Armenia continues to be at the mercy of Finland
    moving in a single melle unit, we can see on the far left that the Boers have
    done what the Spartans were too timid to do themselves. Nicomedia falls to the
    robot overlords. Curiously, Hebron has not even been scratched.  Too much Dvinnish
    blood in these lads. Also of note in this screenshot, Armenia enters the Atomic
    Era. If Finland takes too long, it may just receive a few nukes as parting gifts.

    no longer shy within his confines of Africa, he wants to explore new vistas. \nIceland’s

    Helsinki is one vacation too far. A lone arsenal ship Leeroy Jenkins its way right
    into the heart of enemy territory and to the port gates of the Finnish capital.
    We can use this screenshot to also appreciate, or unappreciate, the sever lack
    of units for Finland in what is their core homeland. With seven opponents, or
    one-third of all remaining contestants, at this throat, it may finally (just maybe)
    be enough to awake Sweden from its slumber.

  narration: The Blackfoot welcome the ascetic preacher Arius to their side. Not a
    well known figure, but he had much influence in early Christian theological philosophy.
    Will he here too forgo the risen son (Sitting Bull) in place of the father (papa
    Jumping Bull)?

  narration: The Spartans just got more busy. The Boers are moving in, and they not
    keen in coordinating with Dvin on anything. They brush aside what remained of
    Finland’s ground defenses, and move on through.

  narration: In Addis Ababa, the great orisha Orunmila comes forth. While of Western
    Africa descent, rather than East Africa here, Orunmila is not so far from home.
    Lets see what wisdom he can in part to the cyborgs. Maybe it will become a ghost
    in their shells.

  narration: Welp. Turn 6 now and it seems Orunmila spirited himself away and had
    Martin Luther in Rangoon take his place. Lutheranism is founded, and quite fitting,
    for a more deterministic spirituality to take root here. Before we leave this
    screenshot, take a look at the worker army transforming the Sahara.

  narration: A familiar sight here as Theravada is founded in Rangoon. Theravada is
    a sect within Buddhism, and is the oldest still continuous lineage of Buddhism
    to continue to this day. Citizens of the Vietnamese empire can look forward in
    continuing the teachings of their forefathers.

  narration: "I can hardly believe what is shown here. Has there ever been in an instance,
    especially with the mods adding that much more religions and prophets, of the
    Great Prophet founding their appropriate religious faction? Worst of all, this
    may just be the Akkat-U of this version, as the Blackfoot have foregone their
    secondary choice of Wakan Tanka to pick a totally random faith. I am truly dismayed!
    It seems the Blackfoot don’t value Sitting Bull so much anymore after letting
    him down (quite literally) two more times. \nRegardless of my disappointment,
    this new religion will come as a big boon for the Blackfoot. As the only religion
    in the Americas, they have much to gain. Perhaps this is just what they need to
    eventually come out on top."

  narration: Sparta founds Dodekatheism in Jerusalem. At least someone is staying
    true to form. For those not in the know, the translation is of the Hellenic faith
    for the 12 Pantheon of (Greek) Gods. Now whether the denizens of Dvin are now
    worshipping horny Zeus and his demented children, or perhaps the Party Pope, god
    of the dead and entertainment, and his festive mates is yet to be seen. Dionysus
    in particular seems to be present no matter what the sub thinks. It remains to
    be seen if this religion will be as widely successful as the one it replaces,
    since Armenia up north will be spreading Catholicism. Also of note in this screenshot,
    Sparta has built no new military units. They won’t be capturing anything if this
    keeps up. Some people just can’t catch a break always sandwiched between things.
    Mallock curses his Ayyubid blood and fortune.

  narration: Oh no, what has happened here. Songtsen Gampo has chosen not to use his
    prophet. Ron Hubbard shuns the Tibetans! Or maybe, just maybe *tin foil hat* Songtsen
    Gampo is smarter than us all. You can’t lose favor with the competing Vietnamese
    religion if you don’t have one yourself (insert meme here).

  narration: "In our tests this had never happened though. When it counts they seem
    to have faltered. Tibet chose Vajrayana each time. Seems they are keeping true
    to their philosophy, and keeping the esoteric tantric teachings hidden from public
    sight. \nReon points our the first World Congress proposals. Rather tame ones,
    but should find favor with the leaders."

  narration: "An even better view of the reversal of desertification by the Boers.
    Hydroponic Domes and Industrial Complexes will now consume the landscape. Imagine
    what it would be with overlapping Mutacologies instead, x.x \nOutside Gades, there
    is a strike force waiting embarkment. Finland best be worried."

  narration: Finland definitely needs to be worried. Exhausted, attrition has done
    its work. Constantinople stands on the verge of flipping to Iceland. Will we see
    the first double digit capital holder next turn? Armenia also is nearby waiting.
    They can either go for the snipe of the main prize or take Varna easily themselves.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene121.jpg
  narration: If Finland is at the cusp, then Armenia faces the precipice. All their
    cities are one punch away from disaster. Only Finland’s strain on available resources
    and battle strength is saving them.

    of occupation. Seldom a response here by Vietnam.

  narration: Further up the mountain range, Bamda lies vulnerable again. Vietnam just
    needs to locate a melee troop to undue the damage to their border. Also of note
    here, Tyumen has all but been abandoned by Finland.

  narration: "We return to Beryozovo, where the threat has fully subsided. Life will
    begin to settle down. Or you know, stay frozen here. At the very least Tygyn Darkhan
    has one Communications Array to drop his hot new single to keep his citizens warm
    with booty shakin rhythm. \nOh, don’t forget to notice a Finland attempt at Tomtor,
    too."

  narration: Turfan is surrounded on three sides. The Mongolian horde is crashing
    at its gates. Genghis Khan should look forward in quickly adding this city to
    his collection before turning westward to Tyumen.

  narration: Australian relief units pour in from Southeast Asia. The time for the
    Inuit has run out here. Yokohama also now stands undefended and vulnerable if
    attention is not taken away from Tokyo.
- scene_number: "128"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene128.jpg
  narration: As clever readers looking at the mini-map will have already noticed,
    Guadalajara is indeed now in Inuit control. With their Asian campaign has collapsed,
    here in Meso America their chances are looking much better. Australia can still
    mount a comeback, but Inuit forces will be of noticeable better quality, and quantity,
    from here on out in this front.

  narration: The Buccs continue to smell blood, and like sharks get closer to reclaiming
    their lost territory. By the time of this album’s release it will be the 19th
    in many parts, so go ahead, talk like a pirate on this most glorious occasion!
- scene_number: "130"

  narration: Brazil continues to be outsmarted by the Australians. But brain can only
    withstand so much brawn, and indeed the Brazilians still have an overwhelming
    number of units compared to the defenders. Next turn should do it, hopefully,
    fingers crossed.
- scene_number: "131"

  narration: "With that folks the time has come for the InfoAddict screens. Now don’t
    be bummed, this is an important part of the program as well so don’t leave your
    seat. \nThe Boers lead in population looks to be as insurmountable as ever, with
    them having quite an advantage over even the second place Australians. Iceland
    has jumped up quite a bit, with them having more than even spread out Vietnam.
    With Finland losing out on some cities, the Blackfoot enter the top 10."
- scene_number: "132"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene132.jpg
  narration: On the low end, you have all the rumps content with their tiny holdings.
    Expect of course Hawaii, which has in its sole one tile island city more than
    the bottom five combined, and even decently sized Mongolia (lolwut). I want me
    some of that!
- scene_number: "133"
  scene_title: Image 133
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene133.jpg
  narration: Land area, as always, is a bit tricky since it also counts ocean tiles.
    Australia still leads this by a healthy margin, but it is quite deceptive of their
    true power. Here again we find the Blackfoot enter the top 10 in place of Finland.
    Their star is truly on the ascent.
- scene_number: "134"
  scene_title: Image 134
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene134.jpg
  narration: Nearly the same outlook for the bottom half of the list for land area.
    I hope the Buccs can leave this place again someday (no not because they are eliminated!)
- scene_number: "135"
  scene_title: Image 135
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene135.jpg
  narration: One would be surprised judging by this album’s performance, but Australia
    remains the top dog in terms of weaponry. The Inuit and Vietnam also tower above
    the depleted Boers. Brazil comes at fifth place and should really be extending
    this number soon.
- scene_number: "136"
  scene_title: Image 136
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene136.jpg
  narration: Even with 6 brand new Foreign Legions, Tibet is still somehow behind
    Sparta. But only just. The Spartans don’t want to be associated with such pacifists.
    Here in the bottom half is also the Buccs which keep on swinging and fighting
    well, and of course Armenia, which keeps firing in every direction.
- scene_number: "137"
  scene_title: Image 137
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene137.jpg
  narration: Something is odd here in the techs, but Lime told me not too think too
    much. Very well then! The top four have now researched all there is in the game,
    and should not be focusing elsewhere. Coming up behind them is Sibir and Iceland,
    which should not take too long to reach the finish line as well. Many might find
    it just a little bit funny to see Yakutia in the top half.
- scene_number: "138"
  scene_title: Image 138
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene138.jpg
  narration: Look at us Babylonians! Smarter than 9 other civilizations. Testament
    to all the studying we’ve done in the hiatus. We are truly better people having
    lived through it. Looking at this screen though you could hardly believe Mongolia
    and the Blackfoot are so far behind given their current position and unit compositions.
- scene_number: "139"

  narration: "Our first complete Religion Overview. These are your five new religions
    (if you don’t count Catholicism making a return). Vajrayana should join them shortly,
    hopefully. \nThe spread right now is still only in the first original cities,
    plus Yerevan thanks to Armenia’s UA."
- scene_number: "140"
  scene_title: Image 140
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene140.jpg
  narration: What everyone is truly interested in seeing, the religion bonuses. Catholicism
    has double downed on production, Lutheranism picks faith for their nearby desert
    and the Boers nation state bias seems to be showing. Theravada gets what I consider
    to be a big bonus in providing cities with additional damage output, this should
    make Vietnamese cities tough to capture if spread well. Dodekatheism seems to
    have gotten the short end of things, with only Reformation probably providing
    a way for Sparta to catch up in tech.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene141.jpg
  narration: Arianism with absolutely well balanced picks for the Blackfoot to gain
    on multiple factors. Will this be the difference that colors North America a different
    shade of blue?
- scene_number: "142"
  scene_title: Image 142
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part84-scene142.jpg
  narration: "The religion map. Usually a slide we look to in order to spot new cities,
    but it once again becomes a good source for us to gauge the spread of the religions.
    Mostly business as usual, but Tibet’s lack of religion, and Armenia’s UA, are
    sure to mix things up considerably. Sparta’s religion may have not had another
    faith to compete with in Cairo, but it has Catholicism right next door. Poor Ayyubid
    descendants, how history repeats for you. \nSo ends the first album on the return
    from hiatus and the first running Mk 2.1. I’m glad for all those that join us
    once more, and for those visiting for the first time. If you thought this was
    a great part, you are not prepared for the next. Come back next week, and every
    week after that, for more! \n– Coiot"
