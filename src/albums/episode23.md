  narration: "<p>My name is Dawkinzz, and this is episode twenty three: A Song of Spice and Ire. Ands it’s going to be a very special edition because I’m winging it! I don’t have any narration to go by, so this is going to be a very special audio recording (and album narration). So without further ado, let’s get right into this.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We’ll start with some OC from user Samcro360; It shows the Uruguayan foot infantry in there final moments before hearing the trees speak Kuikurian. Yeah, that fight between them has been going on for centuries so I cannot imagine anyone wanting to be a part of any of that whatsoever. So, let’s see how that develops this episode, shall we? </p>"

  narration: "<p>Of course the SPOR map by ThyReformer, which helps us keep track of all the wars around the cylinder. I for one completely lost track of everything happening, so it was not obvious to me, but it took me a long time to realize that the map is organized in geographical order. I thought it was random based on size and space, but that is the World, that is the Cylinder… and I’m dumb. </p>"

  narration: "<p>For the PR slide again this week—I think it's like the fourteenth time in a row—Uruguay tops the charts. They have an abundance of units all over the cylinder and they have developed the atomic bomb, and did it real quick. You can see that in the slide there is a little plane, or perhaps a bomb, at the airport of one of their cities, so let's see if they can put it to good use against the Kuikuro.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin this episode with a capital capture. The Venetians have really pulled through after being put so low at the beginning of this season. I really like our boys in purple because they have taken Aachen and I hope that this purple blob can continue. Regensburg will burn and be destroyed by the next part so there's no hope for them unless Venice attacks the Viking city and takes it, which I don't think will happen. The Moors are putting their tanks in the front line with Venice. I would hope that Venice put some defensive units there otherwise that could be a turn around and Murano would be yellow instead of purple. The Czechs are looking a little defensive with some outdated units will see how that goes but that Great General is looking mighty ready to put down a citadel to take more chunks out of the HRE. Also, the Manx need to also develop their units otherwise it's going to be orange pretty soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Songhai really is the filling of this turd sandwich as the Moors come from the west and Benin is striking through the east. The only thing that would make it worse is if Nubia attack them as well but I can't see this going much further for Songhai since Benin his going to take Timbuktu, they're going to take Kukiya, and if the Moors continue to push we will see some trouble for Songhai. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Evenks take defend Vorkuta after the Kazakhs declare war on the Canton Pirates so far away. It's an abusive relationship. There are plenty of reindeer and crossbow boys in the area but they're going to definitely need to upgrade if they want to stand a chance to do anything. The Kazakhs have their little pistols and their whatever unit that is—I think it's the Legionnaire (Coiot: Cuirassier)—they are named at taking parts of the Evenks but they need to build up to so I can't predict anything going on except at a glacial pace up here.</p>"

  narration: "<p>What is Muscovy doing exactly, and why are they just in the middle of everything. Few settlers on the slide, the Czechs and Muscovy’s notably. They have their sights set on building a city but where they'll do it is anyone's guess. This is an otherwise fairly peaceful step in that any even at one population will grow. Those another spiked helmets from the Prussians really need to start moving along and start taking people out before they get outdated pretty soon.</p>"

The Vikings have taken over the North Atlantic pretty thoroughly the only thing they have to deal with are the Moors up north, and they have all of Iceland. Oh boy, this is a force to be reckoned with all those ships and units and I can't see them really having it taken away from them anytime soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Korea is really getting chewed up by the Shikoku, those units are pushing pretty hard into these lands. They really want to take mainland Japan back for their rightful reasons. But, we could see Hamheung might fall within the next turn although there really isn't a unit nearby, because the Kazakh unit is in the way and we can’t get that privateer in. On the other side, Sangju could fall as well and it's a pretty decent size 24 pop city which would be really good for the Shikoku. Not sure what the Haida are doing, they still have their unique unit which I'm not sure when it's able to upgrade but now is the time when they should have declared war on Korea, rather than when they were completely out gunned. Push them on their last legs and push them even further which they should do now. Now. Now!</p>"

New Zealand is already on the back foot with Taungoo taking it from the West. If Tonga is just able to get their stuff together and attack they could take a lot of land from them, putting the Kiwis even further behind.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Speaking of being on the back foot, the Métis keep being pushed back to the West with Wood Mountain being taken finally and again not burned down, which is a sight to be seen. The Iroqouis have a decent amount of units in the area, but I'd say they'd have to go Southwest rather than towards those Northern shipyards because the Métis have that Navy to defend themselves, but they haven't been really able to use it so just keep pushing Hiawatha! </p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have the terrifying front that is the Uruguayan / Kuikuro border. I don't know how the Kuikurans have been able to defend against this force. If you can see they have regular infantry, that's better than anyone I've seen on the cylinder thus far. They have atomic weaponry, which not sure where that went, but how they utilize it is yet to be seen but you can see that Secú no longer has that little airplane / potential atomic bomb in it. The Kuikuro can consider themselves lucky for now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Uh oh. Is this the Marathan carnival? Kazakh lands are being filled with Marathan units, which is not a terribly good sign for them at the very least. It’s a good thing that the Khamugs don't have open borders because they have open land that they need to start filling with units, if they want to defend themselves against Maratha of all people. They don't even share a border but the Khamugs need to wake up, then they need to start the fires are boiling that water so they can defeat their enemies! </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Taungoo have consolidated this string of former New Zealand Islands which is to their favor if they want to continue pushing down further into Ashenya. We can also see that the Apache and the Canton Pirates are at are at war with one another, which is pretty cool I guess, I'm not sure where that's going but not cannon and pikeman are unfortunately in dire straits. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Ségou, Tlemcen, Oualata, all of it is going down and Songhai is circling the drain. Aoudaghost, Bamako, and Gao haven't taken any damage yet but they are starting to get surrounded by those sharks. Uruguay also has a strong footing in Africa of all places and this is not exactly the Resurgence of the Chilean backdoor squad that we wanted from Mark I. Uruguay needs to go down and no I'm not being biased at all I'm just a Selk’nam fan.</p>"

That's a lot of units, a lot of ranged units, but whether they will be able to take these cities is unclear. Will Benin be the ones that take these cities or will Songhai be able to defend itself and remain relevant?</p>"

  narration: "<p>A relatively peaceful shot of the region and you wouldn't necessarily be able to tell that two of these civs are at war with one another. The Golden Horde have been squished down two more of a golden coin rather than an entire nation and the Goths are just kind of sitting there... taking potshots from time to time. Everybody just needs to push! I've been saying it a lot throughout most of these slides, everyone just needs to get their s*** together and push but that’s the AI for you.</p>"

The Apache are taking a few potshots here and there but Cut Knife is still at regular health, no damage done and we'll see if the Métis are able to consolidate their forces. They're taking them all over the place and the Iroquois even pushing towards Battleford. Will they be able to defend this front or will they also suffer the same fate as the Songhai?</p>"

  narration: "<p>A shot of Hawaii – the most important part of the cylinder. The shikoku have really laid down roots here and Uwajima is at 26 population which isn't bad. Monywa is Taungoo territory but it has been at 4 population for the past six episodes, so not sure what they're doing? They might want to get to work boat out there sometime soon. You can see that Uruguay is sending its pastors to spread the good word of what is it again? Some Christian variety. Also if you didn't see the last slide Palmyra declares war on the Murri. Better watch out!</p>"

If they continue to push further south they could take a good chunk out of the rest of West Africa with Songhai or potentially push Uruguay out of Africa which would be wonderful.</p>"

Honestly, Indira just has to sneeze and they're gone; Palmyra just has to look their way and they're gone; even the Madagascan cannon and musket men could probably take the city if they wanted to, but things aren't looking good for them and they need to, I don't know, I guess just die already.</p>"

Ah, poor Papua, they were once so mighty and cool with their neon green filling Northern Oceania but now they're just two little Islands, two little boys just sitting in the ocean. Australia is starting to rebuild and I see a settler moving North to take the place where Alice Springs used to be. Let's see if Australia is able to do anything as they've been a bit sleepy and I still don't like them so I don't want them to be successful.</p>"

Here in the center of the slide we see that the Evenks are being pushed back by the Kazakhs, who stand a chance of doing some serious damage if they actually start attacking things. All of those cities have full health so I'm not sure what they're standing around doing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Liberec is taken from the HRE and Venice continues to expand into northern Europe. Aachen looks to be safe and secure and will continue to be a part of the Venetian Empire. The other lands around Vienna and Speyer look a little empty, so the Vikings need to fill that out a bit. Prague is still looking pretty plentiful. and other news—os***—I forgot to mention all of the wars that have been declared in the right side of the map. OK! Venice and Czechia are at War so I guess I got a little cocky and hopefully Liberec remains purple or not, I don't know. The Vikings declare war on the Czechs as well, so that's a problem which I kind of addressed before, that northern Europe is not filled with many melee units or units in general. so will the Czechs actually do some damage, that would be pretty weird in a two-way War. Also to note that was the Brandenburg Gate is built in Konigsberg the Prussians, which is a pretty good unit producing Wonder. The Sami and Haiti are at War, which will probably be the defining moment of this entire game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yeah, I don’t see Songhai getting out of this with much of anything. You have Aoudaghost which is at zero, as is Constantine but the Moors need to push a melee unit forward if they wanted to capture anything. Gao is gone (just add an n that – gaon).  Benin has just really continued to expand. The Songhai have very few units that other than maybe a cannon and some prophets, but they're going to need to say their prayers if they want to last the rest of this episode.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Whangamata must have flipped and then flipped back and you can see that New Zealand is pushing against those former islands of theirs. Taungoo is thankfully, and I mean thankfully depending on your perspective, being pushed back a little bit, but I don’t think that little Squad is going to last. New Zealand needs to continue building ships if they want to remain relevant and the Taungoo have really been proven themselves. I'm really impressed with them this game if they continue to play their cards right they could be a major contender for this game. Is that the meme?</p>"

I really love their colors so I can't knock them for that, but if Haida were to declare war I'm not sure exactly who would necessarily be the winner? It’s probably the Haida today we win but let the Yu’pik have their 15 minutes of fame because they have been doing pretty good with their ice sheet fleet, let's see if that'll continue.</p>"

I'm not sure what unit that is that the Koreans have (Coiot: It’s their UU, the Chongtong.) but it's not doing much to save their lands. I'm talking about that little unit north of Hamheung, it's really quite interesting to see Korea become a Siberian Civ. In other news the Declarations of War on Haiti seem to be continuing as the Ottomans make their feelings known. Also, my favorite, the Selk’nam declare war on Haiti which brings us to a really good fanfiction that I'd like to see in the sub somewhere. who would win the followers of the Eldritch Horrors or those that practice da’ voodoo.</p>"

Oh boy, if they were to move further north to the Qin or even to the Canton Pirates they would easily them no question hands down. But if you look to the west, Maratha could give them some problems.

Now let's see, in peace news, Uruguay and Songhai, the Prussians and Songhai, the Apache and Songhai, the Ottomans and Songhai, and the Selk’nam and Songhai, are all at peace, and thank goodness because that was going to be a deal-breaker for them in some way (ha). Still at zero health with no melee units around but Constantine and Kano have flipped to the Moors. Oh boy, yeah we could also be seeing this elimination this episode. Also, it looks like Gao might have been flipped by Songhai and then immediately flipped back by Benin.

Ah, the Iroquois have really started to make a name for themselves in this area with Itsagahiti and Ganneious being taken. If they are able to turn their sights and move some of those ships against Haiti, they won’t really face much resistance.
