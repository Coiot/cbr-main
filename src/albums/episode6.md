  narration: "<p>This map provided by /u/Vihreaa is often the first map out by the time the part ends. So far, the Khamugs seemed to have formed a question mark on the map and Uruguay’s spread makes South America look like it’s sinking into the ocean.</p>"

  narration: "<p>/u/Spherical_Melon made an amazing map this week. Our 4 largest cities are all island civ capitals. Our island civs this mark follow in the footsteps of Hawaii in mk. 2. They accumulate huge populations but do not settle that many cities. Will they end up like Hawaii too? Surviving only to be eaten by a continental power. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Looks like this week Zimbabwe regain their number #1 spot from the Khamugs. The Khamugs settled a lot the last few parts but they seem to have neglected their military compared to their neighbors, so they fell, while Zimbabwe has both a huge military and plenty of cities. A good choice for number 1!</p>"

  narration: "<p>We start off this part with a shot of the Moorish-Venetian front at Murano. Moorish forces have taken the city down to a little over half health. With Venetian reinforcements being on the wrong side of the Alps, it’s hard to see how Venice can keep this city.</p><p>To the North, William of Orange has taken up the position of Holy Roman Emperor and already a new settler is out and ready to claim the rapidly disappearing free territory in Europe.</p>"

Did he blaspheme against the gospel of Televangelism?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kintarō, the Japanese scout encounters a large sea to the north of the great Khamug Mongols. His shogun had commanded him to explore the Great Western Land, but after months of traveling he had forgotten what it was like living on the sea. As Kintarō reached the shore, the fishermen that he questioned told him of a new settlement the Great Khan had established on the opposite shore. Apparently, Taichi’ut, the new settlement, was quickly becoming swarmed by holy men from a mysterious land farther north than Kintarō had ever been. The fishermen were wary of this new settlement since it seemed that the Great Khan had set his eyes on this land of mystery, and war might come to follow.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Angered from the sacking of Danzig, Frederick begins his counter-offensive at Vladimir. He sends out a company of spearmen first to test the city’s defenses. It reports back to say that other than the city’s personal militia, it’s as if Ivan has abandoned Vladimir. Frederick can't believe his luck, a city almost freely given. He just hopes that the Goths to the east aren’t thinking the same thing as him.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mithridates continues to shoot arrows into the burning city of Almaty with his horsemen and is puzzled why the city isn’t his already. His general down south recommended sending a detachment of soldiers into the city to claim it, but Mithridates waved him off. Surely the best way to attack a city was to fire volleys of arrows at it and never enter it.</p><p></p><p>In other local news, Zenobia sends Indira a declaration of war. Indira, quite miffed, said that Zenobia is cancelled and put her portrait in her burn book.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A large detachment of troops from Poverty Point head northeast towards the Iroquois city of Hostayuntwa. Early reconnaissance suggests that most of the Iroquois army had been sent north to the Great Lakes to fight the Kingdom of Canada, so Tahera expects Hostayuntwa to not put up too much resistance against the force she sent.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A joint Australian-New Zealander force attacks the Murri capital of Cavanbah, bringing down to half health. While New Zealand renews its naval invasion of the Murri, a Tongan setter sails by Christchurch. Seems like Saosi wants to settle the one tile island nearby, will this break the curse of the 3-city island gang?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The first few Songhai troops enter Benin’s territory and find themselves unprepared! Askia, while commanding a frightening military, has forgotten to send more than just a paltry force to the Benin capital. Ewuare, on the other hand, has organized a defensive line near Ughoton and upgraded all the archers in his empire to composite bowmen. This invasion won’t be easy for Songhai.</p>"

Have you had too much to drink?” Ragnar didn’t believe this fool one bit.</p><p></p><p>“They didn’t go through the Sami, my king, they arrived in Bergen itself on boats!”</p><p>“Ha! Boats! Who would ever attack someone with boats? A bunch of madmen that's who!” said the King of the Vikings.</p>"

  narration: "<p>After Ablai Khan spent years trying to find the fabled Nenet cities, he had to ride home in disgrace, the Parthian invasion now demanding his attention after dozens of letters from local governors panicking about the southern invaders. The Nenets, however inspired by this great victory against a foe many times their size, build a new settler in the hopes of starting a new age of Nenetsi expansion. Maybe next time they will be the ones to ride south looking for spoils.</p>"

  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Great Bay has been a meeting place for the powers of the region for quite some time now. The eviction of the Cantonese from Qiongshi and Shikoku from Pyongyang have strengthened the Qin and Korea and this region looks like a flashpoint for a war that will decide the fate of East Asia for the rest of the time. The Qing are now with a settler navigating out of the bay maybe intending to settle a city on the island of Jeju, throwing the balance of power in their favor.</p>"

  scene_title: "Notices Bulge"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reports came back to Ewuare of the cities he had ordered settled to the east and they were quite strange. His governors had sent letters detailing a group of people in the new city of Owo who claimed to be possessed by the local animal spirits. They would take to dressing up in skins of hyenas and lions and their speech had slurred to a state in which the sounds they made were more animal in nature than humans. Ewuare knew not what to make of the strangeness of Owo but all he could do hope that the new city of Udo to the north didn’t fall prey to the same affliction.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Papuan Play"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>For far too long, Rajapapua had been the butt of the joke amongst his neighbors. His position made him look weak. But Rajapapua had enough of that. Now he was taking action by declaring war on the Australians who were too busy with the Murri. The Papuan navy is beginning its voyage to the vulnerable city of Perth. If Papua get a foothold in Australia now, they will have opened a path to victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>"

  scene_title: "Nu-bye-a"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>After a fruitless war, both Libya and Zimbabwe agree to settle peace with Nubia. Nubia has maintained a good defense after getting declared on by half of Africa but that can be mostly put up to lackluster efforts put in by their enemies. Ndongo is the only civ left at war with Nubia and they should probably make peace as well as now the Zimbabwean army has no other priorities left other than a distracted neighbor.</p>"

  scene_title: "Norsing Around"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the previous slide, the Sami were shown to have peaced out with the Prussians. This is bad news for the Vikings because now the Sami can focus on their more immediate neighbors. Luckily for the Vikings, they seem to have started ramping up military productions and have started building spearmen, while the Sami haven’t got a single spearman in their ranks.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Underwater Acropolis"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Haida have shown themselves to be the superior culture of North America by building the Parthenon in their capital, Ninstints. This wonder, weirdly situated in the water it seems, grants the Haida +4 culture and a Great Work of Art. A great bonus for a culture victory, but it seems that the Haida have forgotten that they’re in a deathmatch. The production used on this wonder would have been much better spent on a settler instead.</p>"

  scene_title: "Lord Almaty, the Parthians are Coming"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Almaty finally falls as Parthia manages to get a warrior in there and has now started advancing on Sighnaq. This war has gone terribly for the Kazakhs and it seems that the Kazakh core is under threat too. Things are looking dire for our former #1 civ!</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Purple Persia"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>We see our aubergine neighbors, India and Parthia, settling the mountain passes and hills of the Hindu Kush. These two empires are strong and have great stats. If a war was to erupt here, it would get bogged down into a stalemate quickly. If I had to give an advantage though, I would give it to India in this terrain as Indira’s cities are situated on nearly unassailable terrain while Mithridates’s cities are only defended by the hills that immediately surround them.</p><p>In other news, a Golden Horde trireme brings the Caspian coastal city of Kuchan to the yellow, however Tokhtamysh needs more than one boat to capture that ill-defended city.</p>"

  scene_title: "Udo-No"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>A Songhai chariot archer rides up to the city of Udo with the intent of capturing it. He rides up and starts firing volleys at the city, not realizing that he left his comrades behind in the desert. Without support, he is surely to die.</p><p>Further to the south, a Nubian settler finds space between Benin and Beta Israel. Is Piye thinking of forward settling his neighbors, earning even more of their ire? Maybe he has more of a masochistic streak than we realized.</p>"

  scene_title: "An Unexpected Comeback"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The regional governor of Perth walks out to the seashore and sees the largest fleet of ships he has ever laid eyes on. The Papuans had come as they had promised. Hawkes had called up the reserves to fight against the dastardly Murri and thought the Papuan declaration of war to be a non-threat, so Perth was left almost undefended. This fleet would sail into Perth unopposed. The governor realized with a grim thought that this would mark the first instance of foreign control of the continent.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bergen for a Beating"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ragnar pushes Prussian forces from the city of Bergen, taking it back for the Vikings. However, Frederick has three triremes in reserve for another attempt to take back the city, and most horrifying for the Vikings, a settler. Will we see a Prussian city in Scandinavia?</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Recc-ed"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Alaric seems to be on a settling spree as he settles Lugo and sends two more settlers west of Muscovy. Ivan’s paths of expansion are rapidly being cut off as the Goths try to emulate the Khamug’s encircling of China in Russia.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Journey to the... uh... East"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ryoma seems to have forgotten that Northern Honshu and Hokkaido exist and refused to settle there. It’s alright though since Cixi has seen this vacancy and has so graciously volunteered to send a settler there. It seems we will see a divided Japan this time. Shikokoof indeed.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Manifest Destiny"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Apache have settled the city of Ka’igwui northwest of the Aztec city of Tlatelolco. This could be an attempt to cut off Montezuma’s expansion into California and may cause conflict between the two civs. Poverty Point on the other hand have still refused to settle the settler near Shis-inday. Is Tahera afraid of angering Geronimo?</p>"

  scene_title: "If You can't Beat ‘Em, Go Somewhere Else"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Moorish attack on Murano has stalled, a lack of melee units in position being the factor, Venice has sent a detachment of archers to relieve the city. I doubt that Venice will be able to defeat the Moors but maybe Enrico will convince them to go away. Although the Moors’s war effort slows, they have settled the city of Malaqah near the tip of France. This could be an important staging point for a future invasion of the British Isles!</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Mess-opotamia"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>As Palmyra consolidates Nakhal, Oman seem to have drawn up a defensive line of archers. It’s safe to say that this is about as far as Palmyra can go. They are the clear winners of this war and Oman has been banished from Iraq. Oman also concludes a war with Nubia that was going nowhere fast as well. An Indian trireme watches the crazy situation in the Middle East and is reminded of home.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "No U"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Askia, outraged by the settling of Tlemcen well into West Africa, settles Taghaza next to the Algerian city of Annaba. Not to be outdone though, Abeldaker sends a settler south, right on the outskirts of Aoudaghost. If there is anything we can learn about this exchange, it’s that both leaders are petty as hell.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Amazonia Prime"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The military buildup in the Amazon by the Nazca wasn’t just for show and use that build up to attack Kuikuro. Although the Nazca have a sizeable force, it is quite spread out and is hurt by the jungle’s movement penalties. On the other hand, Kuikuro have just integrated composite bowmen into their defenses and seem well prepared to handle an attack from the Nazca. If the Nazca don’t centralize their attack quickly, they might even lose Paredones.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Perth Problems"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>The attack on Perth seems to be going excellently for Papua as Australia doesn’t even try to save the city. The Papuans have total naval dominance and after They have conquered Perth, they could even make a swing at Brisbane. Australia better peace out with the Murri fast if they want to keep their northern cities!</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Long Way from Home"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ewuare continues to fend off the Songhai. Edo is not under too much danger as the attacking force is quite small. To the south, Queen Nzinga has begun a project to establish more cities as she becomes wary of an ever-expanding Zimbabwe. Africa right now is a balancing act and anything that changes it can cause it all to come crashing down.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Ragnarok"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings find themselves warred from all sides. The HRE and the Sami join Prussia in trying to evict the Vikings from life itself. The Sami begin their attacks southwards, but this is one area the Vikings are not too shabby. Their spearman provides a good defense against the warriors the Sami field. If there’s anything the Vikings have to fear, it’s the fact that they completely lack a navy and are defenseless from coastal attacks.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Was it a good idea to build only coastal cities?"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Every city down south is vulnerable to a coastal attack. Although none of the Vikings’s enemies are naval powers, it only takes a few boats to capture a city and that’s more than what the Vikings have. The Sami have resumed what the Prussians started and has begun to attack Bergen. Will they capture it? Probably not by themselves.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "A Canadian Peace"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>King gives Hiawatha Winnipeg in exchange for peace and with this move, Canada are officially boxed in. The longest war in the cylinder ends after 47 turns. This might have been a strategic move by King though as Metis seem to be on the warpath and better, they fight the Iroquois and not him.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "No-Conquista"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Murano still lies uncaptured as the Moorish attack stumbles yet again, but luckily for the Moors, a path has opened for their warrior to take Murano in a couple of turns. This war has been a grinder for the Moors and the longer they take to capture Murano, the worse it looks for them. The Moors have also brought a settler near the front lines. Maybe the plan is to settle in the space between Saraqustah and Murano.</p>"

  scene_title: "*Sad Pirate Noises*"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Canton, wounded from the loss of Hong Kong, seems to be caught in a vice between all its neighbors. With another Qin settler near Yueyang, it seems that there is no hope for them in China. Canton needs to use this to instead forge a naval empire, but in order to do this, Canton needs to build boats, something that Ching Shih has seemed quite unwilling to do.</p><p>Up north, a Qing settler shows up in between Ba’arin and Quanqiu. Does Cixi want to add to the border gore of China?</p>"

  scene_title: "A Second Chance"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>We saw earlier that Haiti declared war on the Iroquois. Fortunately, the Iroquois have not focused on their southern neighbors at all and have neglected to build a navy. Haiti is unchallenged at sea and has a very good chance of capturing Teaiagon and even Deseroken. C’mon Haiti, you can do it!</p>"

  scene_title: "Right in the Down Under"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>Perth falls! Rajapapua is beside himself in glee as a significant amount of ground forces arrive in Australia and split his navy into two portions going Brisbane and Darwin respectively. At this point, Sulu should think of joining the battle because if they don’t, they might find themselves surrounded by Papua of all civs!</p>"

  scene_title: "A Steppe too Close"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Goths settle Ologicus and effectively cut off the Golden Horde’s northwards expansion. Parthian and the Horde’s forces clash north of Otrar in what seems to be a pointless fight. The Horde missed the opportunity to intervene in this war and now must deal with a strong neighbor to the north and across the Caspian.</p><p>In other news, Ablai Khan decides the best way to reinforce Sighnaq is to send settlers out. Fortunately for the humbled horselord, the Parthian advance has seemed to run out of steam and the local garrison should be enough to at least hold them off until one side sues for peace.</p>"

  scene_title: "Fighting Wars Good"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>Poverty Point’s war effort continues to annoy the Iroquois more than anything. Poverty Point’s soldiers have conveniently formed a queue to attack Hostayuntwa and fortunately for the defenders, have resolved to attack one at a time, like gentlemen. Etiquette is very important, and it would not be like Tahera to be nothing but proper, even in times of war.</p>"

  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another fruitless war between India and Nepal ends. Honestly, I just think that Indira and Prithvi just go to war to get an excuse to see each other on the battlefield. It’s almost like they’re teasing each other. Ignoring the Romance of the 3 South Asian Kingdoms, Nepal and Khamug both settle cities in the Tibetan plateau, Nuwakot and Manghut respectively. Indira also seems ready to found a city just south of Tashkent. This area seems ripe for stalemating wars.</p>"

  scene_title: "Where’s Floridaman when You Need Him?"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>Haiti seems to split up the naval force into two, focusing more on Deseroken. This is odd because if anything, Teaiagon seems better as it’s easier for Haiti to control Florida than the Carolina coast. But hey, L’Ouverture has exceeded expectations already, so I have faith in him.</p>"

  scene_title: "Amazon Doesn’t Do Refunds"
  slide_url: https://latest.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode6-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ouch. This war did not go the way the Nazca had planned it to. Their attacking force has been either wiped out or pushed back and the Kuikuro have mobilized. Paredones is under attack and doesn’t look long for the world. If the Kuikuro take it, they could consolidate the Amazon for themselves and establish themselves as a power on this already strange continent.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zimbabwe builds the Gate of the Sun! This non-vanilla wonder provides +3 Food and +1 Gold on lake tiles and, most importantly, a 15% food bonus in all cities. This will make Zimbabwe’s already insanely strong position even stronger! Africa is currently on a population and city boom and I can count 7 settlers in this shot alone!</p>"

  narration: "<p>The recent Murri settle of Beerwah has already been taken down to the red by Australia. This city was founded this part and it seems like Australia just won’t tolerate a random Murri city in the worst part of the Outback. In worse news for Australia, Papuan forces have just arrived at Darwin, and although it’s unlikely that they’ll take the city, Hawkes shouldn’t give them a chance.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Eadni sat by her hearth as her advisors bickered in the background. The army’s advance had been blunted and they were having trouble against Ragnar’s forces. His groundbreaking technology of pointy sticks had the Sami commanders in a tizzy. The shouting of the advisors got louder and louder until Aile, her granddaughter, pulled a knife out and started waving it at her younger brother.</p><p>“Children, this is no place to fight. This is the war room. Now, are you done?” Eadni’s voice was quiet but everyone shut up and started scouring the maps in a much more reserved manner. Eadni shifted again and pulled out a pair of knitting needles.</p><p>“I’m too old for this”</p>"
