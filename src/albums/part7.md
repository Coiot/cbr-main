      "Welcome back to the /r/Civ 60+ Civ Battle Royale Mk. II | Part 6! Today
      we‘re having veteran narrator /u/eurogama do the narrations. Don’t forget to ignore
      work and family obligations by indulging in all the hype and amazing fan-produced
      content easily found on the MEGATHREAD: https://redd.it/3iv859\nEurogama‘s note:\n“I
      go by eurogama on reddit; in real life, I am an editor for a major English-language
      daily. Of course, us editors need to cut loose when not on duty, so please no
      grammar nitpicking! \nMy tastes run to the serious analysis / wargaming side;
      I have written longer gaming-based historical fiction elsewhere (Europa Universalis
      represent) but I‘d prefer to leave most of that to the fan community.  \nSince
      it‘s been a few days, If you want the quickest possible recap of where we are,
      I recommend the War Room series: http://imgur.com/a/F0VzZ#12 ... you might also
      want to cruise through the power rankings if you haven‘t.\nAnd without further

      "Whatever you want to call it, Constantinople is going down, down, down,
      don‘t mess around. A real nice city for Leonidas -- possibly better than his own
      capital, in all honesty.  With Byzantine archers all uselessly embarked and thereby
      in the Danger Zone, Leonidas may well have designs beyond Constantinople as well.
      \ \nFrom the north, Polish traders ply the wastes of Carpathia, will they return
      news of the Byzantine feeding frenzy in time to give Kasimir the notion of extending
      his southerly holdings?  And in the east, Armenia‘s army does not look capable
      of meaningful intervention -- yet.  They have only just declared war, though,
      so it remains to be seen how many forces are going to shuflle back towards Asia
      Minor.  Tiridates has historically beligerent rivals on many sides.\nYou have
      got to hand it to Sparta; their uiniques always had them primed for early conquest;
      even after whiffing against Rome and Poland, Leonidas finally blundered into the
      right patsy and is pressing it all the way home."

      "Briefly revealed by careful detective work for those in the know (r/soylentbuffalo
      shoutout!) in installment 6, here we have a look at two Blackfoot cities in the
      Aleutian chain. \nI‘m the biggest Blackfoot guy around, and even I am not going
      to feel obliged to memorize the names of these two, for now. So neither should
      you!\nRather than antagonize his Inuit allies-of-convenience, Lord Crowfoot has
      opted for distance and fishing assets, the better to feed a burgeoning population.
      \ With Crowfoot‘s propensity for defense, these cities will be well fortified.
      \ Unfortunately, their utility as naval batteries is undermined by the fact that
      they don‘t truly lie athwart the Inuit path out of the Bering and down the Alaskan
      coast. And as one Inuit settler looks to be headed for the island that would have
      served that purpose very well indeed, another up in the Arctic could either lock
      down the rest of Alaska‘s lame hinterlands or make straight for Siberia."

      And like that, Constantinople goes; at six-pop on the fall, it is tied with the Blackfoot‘s capture of Mdekwankantonwan for biggest city to change hands.  (At least, to my recollection. Baltimore was a fiver.)
      But Sparta‘s go-go push on Constantinople has its drawbacks: Saladin‘s navy immediately plucks Nicomedia from the Leonidas, who ruled it for the blink of an eye.  Wait, whats that? It was from 2460BC to 2370BC?  Yes, generations of men are born and die in the time it takes for some boats to sail across the Mare Nostrum.
      The city has of course been laid low by all the sacking and whatnot, but Nicomedia is actually a rather useful little spot for Saladin, giving him space to build up a sorely-needed naval carpet in the next peacetime.  You wouldn‘t put money down on Sparta‘s navy taking it back any time soon, either.
      Tactical Aside: Sparta‘s little-discussed UB, Syssitia Hall, may give their troops the edge on offense, but the AI may not know how to compensate for the drawback of walls not providing any defensive bonus.
      Second-order speculative historical fiction interlude:
      800BC: A Spartan caravel meets a Blackfoot caravel in the South Atlantic and notes are traded.
      Spartan captain, prideful: “We have heard tales that your warriors are unmatched in skill ... save ours, of course.“
      Blackfoot captain, guardedly: “Likewise.“
      Spartan: “How do your men grow so skilled in battle?“
      Blackfoot, after pondering whether to respond: “As youth, they run amongst the great herds of buffalo until they become wise in the ways of massed 1UPT warfare.“
      Spartan: (gulp) “That‘s amazing!“
      Blackfoot: “And how do you train your young so?“
      Spartan: “Well, in the time we save by not building city defenses, they learn the arts of war.“
      Blackfoot: “No wonder you only have four cities left.“

      "And again, we see Leonidas not exactly succeeding at keeping all his
      balls in the air. (keep those balls in the air!)  Olympia‘s defense will arrive
      too late to save the city from Saladin‘s admittedly unsophisticated but numerically
      superior army.  \nWorth noting: thus far Leonidas has gotten 13 or so free “infantry
      units“ (read: hoplite carpet) for pop. growth in his capital.  Now a healthy pop-18,
      Sparta isn‘t going to continue growing at that rate.  Of note: Cairo, at 16 and
      getting at least some religion income, is pretty swank.  Oh, and if Jerusalem
      falls, what happens when Ayyubid have two holy cities, anyhow?"

      "Two turns ago, Saladin bribed Osei Tutu II, king of the Ashanti, into
      his war against Carthage. Because when you‘ve decided to war on three fronts,
      you want allies!  That‘s just good doctrine.  Well here we see Ashanti not exactly
      stirring themselves into trans-Saharan action. Ejura (held by Ashanti) is the
      only city in play here, and the real question is: will Hannibal prioritize capturing
      it, or defending against Saladin?  Saladin seems like the bigger threat, but Carthage
      has grudges with Ashanti, for sure. \nAlso, re: the Ashanti... don‘t get too excited
      about that carpet of their UU, the Drumroll  Warrior.  They‘re just under-strength
      spearmen.  I‘d rather have an army of Doof Warriors.  Then you‘d hear some drumming.\nIn
      the wings: Mali looks almost comically irrelevant; the most interesting thing
      happening on this slide frankly is the declaration of friendship between Ethiopia
      and Kongo.  For what it‘s worth, Kongo‘s leader appears far more deceptive than
      Haile.  Sooner or later we‘ll find out who‘s zooming who."

      Three turns after flipping back to Hitler, Koln (Cologne) is still part of der Tausendjahriges Reich. Hey, Adolf, you really did make it to a thousand years!  Meanwhile, poor four-city Germany is set to instantly double that total... if only they could find some Lebensraum.  Down in the bunker, Hitler curses the fool who made Europe so overcrowded.  France doesn‘t exactly have the look of a steamrolling invading force here, though.  I think Adolf is going to hang on a while; he had been my tip for first out.  Now you would have to like the Bee-Zees for first casualty.
      I also want to note: accidentally or not, the Jerrys have their city defense doctrine pretty good here; array archers behind cities to shoot incoming forces; there‘s even a great general who might help if he got just a liiiiiitle bit closer to the front.  And on the eastern front, Poland appears to be getting a little too frisky with the catapults; we‘ll soon find out what wave comes next.
      Oh hai, its Sweden!  Not much to see, except a Baltic Sea not clogged with units on every square. I‘d wave goodbye to open seas if I were a Swede / Finn / Pole.

      Now Josef Stalin didn‘t skip the Lebesnraum class at dictator school; that‘s how you settle three cities.  Three gloriously awful, irrelevant cities... unless there is some pressing future need to prevent navies from transiting from the Pacific to the Atlantic via the Eurasian arctic? What‘s that you say, Yakutia is the biggest threat in the game?  Hmm.  Someday the Allies may be shipping Stalin surplus military hardware to outfit the dour defendes of Krasnodar and Gorkiy.
      In other news: Ethiopia has friends in the far east.  And in other, ghostlier news: Portugal has denounced Saladin.  Now that‘s a potential conflict I could get behind; Portugal might be the best-suited country to boss around the waves of the Mediterranean.
      Life must be unspeakable awful in Krasnodar and Vladivostok, so let‘s not gawk.

      "Well, well, well.  One explanation for some of the Sioux sloppiness
      in their war with, well, everybody: they were cranking out Petra in Wahpekute!
      \ And got it!  A sucker-punch for Arabia, Ayyubids, and the other civs that could
      have put it to better (frankly, much better) use... but hay!  BRmkI veterans will
      remember Sitting Bull as one of the first to carpet the world with archaeologists
      so maybe he‘s just lining up Petra for that big culture bonus?  Beeline for Archaeology,
      yes please!\nAnyhow... we digress.  You are all interested in whether Benito has
      on his fighting trousers this time around.   The answer is: are you fucking joking?
      \ The swarm around Veracruz could pluck that Petra right quick and instead they
      are ... what?  I can‘t say.   Meanwhile a totally insufficient force has been
      sent toward Sissiton. \nSubstantially complicating matters in favor of Sisseton‘s
      defense is the enclave of Texian land inside Sioux territory.  Well, in favor
      of Sisseton‘s defense until it‘s Texas invading.  Patience!  Sam Houston has a
      lot of strength to rebuild.\nNow, Compound archers vs. regular archers is a pretty
      decisive advantage in this era, and Mexico‘s on the right side of the divide...
      but Mexico is... I‘d make that shrug emoji but it‘s easier to just type words,
      dripping with sweet, sweet scorn.\nUp north: yeah, Blackfoot is not losing Mdewakantonwan.

      Up in the frozen wastes of Ellesmere, Baffin and other nameless islands beyond Hudson Bay, the wily majesty of Sitting Bull‘s plan becomes evident: found disposable cities to lose and thereby make wars go away!   (it‘s particularly funny that the city Ekhuenick is probably going to settle for is named YANKTON AI.  Has the crisis situation driven Sitting Bull‘s AI into self-awareness?)
      Canada, meanwhile, is probably going to fall for the same gambit in Oohenupa, while other more bountiful cities could be had in Sioux‘s darkest hour.  A future of Canada/Inuit entanglements await.

      in on the Nordsee and Baltic as well here; If you‘re wondering who has the most
      impressive military in the vicinity, it might just be Norway, who i reckon could
      be eyeing up a bite of Hamburger if Poland bleeds off a little more of Hitler‘s
      strength.  Meanwhile, Ireland has the beginnings of a navy going, and Elizabeth
      has her archer carpet, as expected."

      but Burma has some things going for her; cities at 17, 12, 9, 9 and 8; a religion,
      a wonder (the Colossus is visible in this frame) and most importantly, a lot of
      mountains between her and the Trungs.  A peace with Tibet is basically a formality.
      \ Burma may be in good shape to crank out a belated military here and make a move.
      \ (Indonesia the most likely target.) ... in general, Burma really needs a decent

      Skipping ahead two turns, Inuit found Qausuittuq in the Aleutians, effectively cutting off Blackfoot‘s two island colonies until open borders or deep-sea travel; i don‘t see any evidence of open borders between the anti-Sioux allies.  Too soon?
      The generally-demilitarized nature of this area bodes well for peace between the two.  Meanwhile, A Mexican scout noses around in habitable, claimable space in the Inuit hinterland. What could go wrong?

      colony in the Venezuelan highlands.  For an island-based civilization, you would
      say the Buccaneers are going against ARRRRRRchetype.  Well, that‘s my joke.  \nThough
      they are not quite in the frame, the absence of Inca here speaks volumes as to
      their AWOLism; how were they not here already?  Meanwhile, Parana is growing nicely
      and will make a tasty plum for the Buccaneers or, possibly, Pedro.  Even if Eva
      Peron isn‘t quite the patsy this game she was in BRmk1, surely holding Parana
      is beyond her.\nStrategy aside: Some thoughts on Morgan‘s game:  The Bucs are
      one of the more interesting elements of the BR, as they could have gone any direction.
      \ Basically I think they‘ve hit every note right, save for leaving open the possibility
      of someone plonking down a final colony in their Caribbean backyard.  Their foothold
      in Florida is in the backyard of the sick man of the Americas -- uh, America --
      and their beating of Maya to the Panamanian spot makes Nassau virtually impregnible,
      while Petit Goave also is too defensible for America to crack.  This leaves them
      focusing on naval dominance (check) and colonizing in South America.  Now Morgan

      "With his focus clearly on defending Shiasapa and Itazipcho from Canada
      and well aware of Mexico‘s track record of incompetence, Sitting Bull wrangles
      a pax bisonus out of Crowfoot, who in all honesty looks like he could do with
      a bit of rebuilding and consolidation at the moment.  Yes, the Blackfoot tribe
      might have claim-jumped their first wonder down in Wahpekute, or pushed on to
      the capital, but taking the Sioux‘s #2 city is more than spoils enough for one
      war.  \nMeanwhile, the Great Lakes look to have given Sioux enough of a natural
      border to hinder Canada‘s advance.  Maintaining a real show of force along their
      shared border to prevent a tired-looking Texian (yes, Texian) military from getting
      any ideas, Sitting Bull is suddenly looking in no way knocked out. \nBlackfoot,
      meanwhile, already have a real nice core of compound archers to get on with War
      No. 2.  While it would be foolish to count out more action against the Sioux,
      or a cold war precipitated by Inuit treachery, the smart money may be on a battle
      with Mexico.  Crowfoot clearly has Pacific ambitions and Mexico‘s got the ports
      he needs."

      Last seen some 15 turns ago (slide 6.26), Rome has gotten its act together, ever so slightly. The Portuguese have failed to defend their impetuous colonial settlement of Funchal, while Caesar has also colonized Sicily, giving him theoretical control over the Central Mediterranean.  Somehow Rome has gone from pop-14 to pop-11 during this time, which I imagine must have come as Portuguese vessels deprived them of their fishing grounds?  Well, it‘s all right now.  Rome has the impregnable Alps to the north and seems to have sent Maria packing.  That just leaves Leonidas as a going concern, but Cumae is *extremely* well defended and Sparta obviously has bigger fish to fry, for now.
      But, it must be said, there are not enough Roman people and not enough Roman armies to get much done.  Naked ballista swarms are not good enough!  Could Legions turn the tide?
      Meanwhile, France doesn‘t seem to have an agenda beyond trying to lay down a nice carpet.  Yes, a few piddles in Munich‘s direction, but the lack of a Mediterranean port is Napoleon‘s Achilles heel; without one he can never hope to engage Rome or Portugal further.

      now contested between sleepy Armenia, and Sparta and the Ayyubids,  maybe the
      two biggest warmongers in the game. (Sorry, Adolf!)  Saladin‘s little fleet that
      could has moved right on to attempting to securint a foothold.  Which, if Trebizoned
      and Varna had walls, you know, might be beyond the means of a couple dinky unescorted
      triremes. \nMeanwhile, badly, badly damaged Spartan hoplites attempt to smuggle
      themselves back home (or, lets be honest, who the hell knows where they are going,
      except maybe a watery grave) across the Aegean, unprotected.  Oh, that‘s a golden
      opportunity there.  Nope, Saladin‘s gotta naked trireme assault two targets at
      once.  Ugh.\nAnd must be said that Armenia‘s military commitment to fighting Leonidas
      is more substantial than we first thought.  Is it beyond the realm of possibility
      that a distracted Sparta is going to lose his Asia Minor holdings to the Yerevan
      throne?\nFinally, it can‘t help but be noticed that the CCCP has a couple catapults
      in the vicinity of Byzantine-held Crimea.  Perhaps a bold plan by Vladimir Putin,
      a junior KGB officer with his eyes on the prize?\nFiction interlude:\nPutin: First,
      we remove all colorings and markings from our catapults.  Then we send them into
      Antioch to “Keep the Peace“ at “the invitation of locals.“  \nStalin: Vere in

      Then, a local legislature declares itself independent of Byzantium, and our units

      declared in Sibir, whose main force is still well to the east and consolidating
      a hold on the recently-captured Mongol city of Old Sarai.  Now Sibir has got to
      be the roomiest looking empire in the game -- a big positive for the future, but
      it could mean a long transit time back to the front.\n Except, well, Attila doesn‘t
      really seem to have... done much prep-work for this little war.  And the Urals
      are a hell of a chokepoint for any Hunnic/Sibir fighting.  No, it would seem the
      real instigator here is the little-seen Timurids.  \nIn the wings: Before we take
      a closer look at Timur, take a note of action from another media-starved empire,
      the Finns; their settler last seen wandering on Turn 113 has planted a city way
      up north.  And, if my skill at calling up a map of Finland and reading bottom-halves-of-letters
      is everything I think it is, i believe that city is LAHTI.  You heard it here
      first. \nOf note: this puts them behind Stalin‘s “Line in the Snow“ and really

      terrible for their crappy desert start. (seriously, not even desert hills...)
      Nobody‘s going to write home about any of their cities, but they have a nice safe
      mountain border with Afghanistan and Persia, and water to protect (most of) their
      cities  from Armenia.  Which of course just leaves the Hun.  Haha.  \nAnd Attila
      can take a bribe LIKE A BOSS, apparently, because that is surely what happened
      here. The Timurids saw the horse archer carpet piling up right up to the border,
      real whites-of-their-eyes stuff, and conceived of a plan.\nIt‘s basically the
      old gambit from Looney Tunes -- “Rabbit Fire“ in particular... hapless Timur held
      up one of those signs on a stick that said “SIBIR SEASON“ with a right-facing
      arrow.  And Attila, in true Elmer Fudd fashion, took the bait and popped off at
      Kuchum Khan.  Boy did Timur dodge a bullet there, wonder what it cost him.  Still,
      clever diplo-play is the key to beating the AI... maybe Timur has legs in this
