  narration: "A squadron of Maori ships have taken the Kimberley colony of Wulungarra to half health. Will ten ships be enough? Well, knowing the AI incompetence at naval warfare, it‘s going to be close.\n \nAlso, in case you haven‘t noticed (how could you, we have a War Room and everything), Sparta and Sweden have made peace. Europe hasn‘t been in peace for a while now. Which is good, because peace is boring, as we all know."

  narration: "It seems that the Kimberley navy have intercepted the Maori reinforcements on their way to Wulungarra. At least I assume they‘re reinforcements; even the AI wouldn‘t be so stupid to launch an attack into a core of another nation with six ships... Right?"

  narration: "Lincoln is desperately trying to retake his capital from the evil Canadians. Then again, Canada isn‘t really attacking the Union either, so I guess that‘s not too bad. Meanwhile, Bernardo O‘Higgins (Chile) has sent another one of his Escuadra Nacionals in hopes of sniping the capital. Good luck with that."

  narration: "They did it! Mongolia took Tabriz! China is reduced to just Shanghai. They‘ll stay alive for a while though, as the next closest Mongolian melee unit is at Beshbalik. Genghis Khan really needs to step up his musket game.\n \nOf note: Ironically, China has zero melee units."

  narration: "You know who are dead though? The Zulus.\n \nThey were pretty much dead from the start given their TSL and even forward settled by the Boers early on. They almost managed to escape the box they were trapped in, but in this game, almost isn‘t enough. Ultimately, they suffered the same fate they did in Mk I: Wrecked by the Boers. At least you tried Shaka."

  narration: "'WOULD YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP ALREADY?!' screamed Elizabeth, pushing the trebuchet through the Carthaginian coast.
