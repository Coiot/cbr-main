  narration: "<p>Hi folks, u/Framonti is here, but more importantly, Episode 8 is here. I’m honoured to narrate this part, and I hope you all will enjoy it as much as I did. Each turn will feature some small actions; small action after small action, the Cylinder will appear quite different at the end. Who will rise, and who will fall?</p><p>Coiot: “Small actions.”"

  narration: "<p>I don’t know why, but this dialogue cracked me when I read it the first time. And, for some reason, in my head Zenobia speaks with the voice of Hermione from HP. “Because it’s REALISTIC! It’s Leviosa, not Leviosar” </p><p>Thanks u/Doccit for the laugh.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we can see the map drawn by u/Vihreaa. Civs are starting to colonize even deserts and ice, but there still is some room for new cities in more fertile spots. Who will grab them?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we can see this strange representation of the world by u/Spherical_Melon. Somebody should tell him the world is cylindric, smh. </p><p>Anyway, I liked a lot of the fantasy behind the name of regions in his maps for Mk2, I hope he’ll be able to add them back. </p>"

  narration: "<p>For the third time in a row, Zimbabwe takes the first position in the Power Ranking. It’s easy to understand why: biggest army in Africa, WAAAY above his neighbours, biggest production in the whole Cylinder, first in techs (18), second in number of cities (12)... it basically has it all. Now the question is: will they be able to use their advantage?</p>"

  scene_title: "A song of Ice and Copper"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We start this episode with one of the few areas on the Cylinder not (yet) crowded.  </p><p>“This is unacceptable” shouts Ivan, thus founding Vologda. “We’ll for sure win the race against the Goths. We won’t be surrounded, even if it means living on the ice,” he adds.  </p><p></p><p>Frederick seems to have given the same exact order to his Prussian settler. If he’s lucky, he’ll also have some stone or copper together with the ice. Not the best cocktail in town, I guess.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ehi, I’ve already seen this one"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>The colour contrast between this and the previous slide is incredible. The Turks are pushing against Ostrava. They have the number and the tech advantage against the Czech, since the latter are also fighting against the HRE. </p><p>But on the other hand, this exact scenario has already happened two times in the past, so I’ll wait before jumping on the Turk hype train.  </p><p>Goth navies are now wandering the Black Sea, without a target. Maybe, just maybe, razing cities to the ground is not the best choice in a domination game, but AI gotta AI.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Great Leap Forward (to the Canton coasts)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Poor Canton, they really can’t catch a break, can they? Ba’arin is captured by Shikoku, and with no melee units around, it’s unlikely it’ll change ownership soon.   </p><p>Hong Kong is also taking damage and the Sulu have completely wiped out the opposing fleet. To make things even worse, Blu China is advancing, even if they are slowed down by the forest. </p><p>A lone neutral scout wanders, risking his life just to inform his leader about conflicts in faraway lands. </p>"

  scene_title: "War, war never change"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking about scouts risking their life, it seems the Venezuelan one in the top left of the screen is going to be sacrificed to the ancient gods, in exchange for some culture. We can also spot two more Aztec settlers wisely heading North, escaping the horror of the war in Central America, only to find themselves trapped. In fact, Apache has declared war against the Aztecs (the notification is hidden). That’s why there is a wounded archer. There are only few units facing each other from opposite sides of the borders, but we’ll see how this conflict will evolve. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyra is honestly terrifying. Gournia is besieged by sea and by land and I don’t think it’ll resist for long. </p><p>Zenobia has even brought to the front her precious UUs, the Clibanarii, a Horseman replacement with 12 Strength, 4 moves, Shock I, Cover I and Great Generals I. </p><p></p><p>Knossos is the first city, I believe, to reach 30 defence points, making the war between Minoa and Nubia a futile waste of resources and arrows, as both Civs don’t have enough manpower to take down the other. </p>"

  scene_title: "No costal city without permission."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite India's best efforts, Hyderabad seems to be doomed. The Marathan fleet is strong and is also reinforced by a Great Admiral. The +15% bonus damage (or the instant heal) may be exactly what is needed for cracking the walls of the enemy city. </p>"

  scene_title: "Antibenification in progress."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ndongo tries to concentrate its forces against the city of Akure, forgetting however to bring melee units (except for a trireme, which is not enough). However, the city is well protected by mountains, a river and is founded on a hill. Not the smartest move by Nzinga. </p><p> </p><p>We can appreciate how Benin is spamming its UI, the Iya, which grants defensive bonuses to cities and units. For sure, it needs it.</p>"

  scene_title: "*Translator note: Keikaku means plan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs finally show why they didn’t send any support unit in their previous wars against Parthia and Nenets: it was all according to keikaku*. They made everybody think that they’re bad and then strike, what a bunch of geniuses. Or maybe they were just AI-ing around. Anyway, they’re taking this opportunity, and I feel it’s the right call: they need all the clay they can get if they don’t want to fade into irrelevance.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sakamoto t"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>The love story between Korea and Japan continues, as it seems they can’t stop trying to be the closest possible. Since Japan were so nice to visit Korea a few turns ago, Seonjo decides it would be pretty unpolite not returning the favour, thus founding Jinju on North Japan. </p>"

  scene_title: "Iron and blood"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The two German Empires decide they have better things to do and settle for peace. This actually allows the HRE to concentrate their troops against the Czechs, now with 100% more swords, even though it seems it’s still a bit impractical with this new technology (its swordsman was embarked, in range of Liberec). Frederick, instead, knows that iron and water aren’t best friends and orders his newly trained troop to stay on the ground.</p><p>The Czechs, on the other hand, only have one spearman in the whole screen, a very worrying situation. </p><p></p><p>Also, the Indians decides they want a participation trophy, and declare war on the Evenks. The latter is at war against, like, eleven different Civs. The World Congress doesn’t exist yet, but the whole Cylinder has decided that deer are immoral and should be banned.</p>"

  scene_title: "The burned city with the pyromaniac leader’s name."

  narration: "<p>The GH decides that the coasts of Caspian Sea are safer, since the Black Sea is too black at the moment. Even safer is the inland, they declare, and so Atil is founded. Again.   </p><p></p><p>We can also see for the first time (I think, but I may be wrong) a Funerary Tower, between Circesium and Palmyra,. This UI becomes available at Construction, can only be built on desert and provides +2 Culture (+1 at Archaeology) and +1 Faith (+1 at Philosophy)</p>"

  scene_title: "Sea traffic"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>I was a bit wrong a few slides ago, Canton still has three naval units. They’re lucky the AI doesn’t really coordinate troops with different moving speeds, but nonetheless their situation is not the brightest. </p><p>Bold prediction: the single Tongo spearman we can see on top of an atoll will snipe Canton’s capital, thus achieving maximum TONGA TIME. Place your bets.</p><p></p><p>Qing is continuing its exclave mission: after colonizing the north, it sends a settler towards the Indian Ocean. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Advisor: “My king, our foes are exhausting themselves in futile wars, we can gain a huge advantage by founding another city. With our UA, they’re an inexpugnable fortress in the wild” </p><p>Anetü: “Just found it on a three tiles island, lmaoo” </p><p> </p><p>Just a bit east of the new city, there is a quick naval skirmish between Uruguay and Venezuela.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Madagascar is trying to do a Haitian cosplay, splitting its forces against two different cities at the same time. It’s a bold move, let’s see when it won’t payoff (spoiler: very soon).  </p><p></p><p>Our first rank still is equipping its troops with axes, a light of hope for all the other African Civs. I can confirm that at the end of episode 7 they still haven’t researched Construction nor Iron Working, but they’ll get there eventually. </p>"

  scene_title: "Militarized settlers (a.k.a cities)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>The new city of Jahkamahkke allows Eadni’s troops to heal faster and advance protected by arrows. I don’t know if this will be a decisive move, but anything that can help break the stalemate in Scandinavia is welcome. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Blue Parade"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs capture Genhe and send a new settler just a bit south of their new city. At the same time, they also start attacking Ergun. With no defence troops in sight, they should be able to take this city. Finally, a good showing by our yellow-blue civ.</p><p></p><p>Four different blue Civs are present in this slides, even if we can say goodbye to the Sami Boazovázzi, suiciding itself against Yakesa. </p><p></p><p>The proxy war between Prussia and Venice is over, after 40ish turns. Nothing interesting happened. </p>"

  scene_title: "Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Vienna"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>HRE and the Mans are now at peace. The conflict probably polluted the North Sea with the wood of sunken ships and the bodies of killed mariners, but in the end, it doesn’t even matter. No cities were captured and all this production will be lost in time, like tears in the ocean. </p>"

  scene_title: "The line between determination and insanity is very tiny"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Ottomans still are unable to advance, even with very few Czech troops defending in front line.</p><p></p><p>The GH, also, decided that the Black Sea is not so black, after all, and move a settler over the ruins of Majar. </p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Line formation"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>We can appreciate one of the best known techniques used by an AI, the “attack one at the time”. To be completely fair, Oman is trying to move around his troops, but the mountains makes this operation very difficult.  </p><p>Beta Israel, on the other hand, observes the conflict and takes note from its new city of Degoma. I hope those sheep are worth all the desert tiles and salty water. They kind of forgot they’re at war against Nubia too. </p><p></p><p>I think we can say goodbye to the Oman settler west of Damascus, as there is a chariot archer ready to take him. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The defeated troops of the Selk'nam are sent into exile in the new city of Yewux. You can’t disappoint your Lord and get away with it, but you can try to remind them that you were going to conquer your target if it hadn’t been for those meddling kids and their peace treaty.

  scene_title: "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Honestly impressed by the defensive skills shown by the Cantonese people, even though for each great defence there must be an equal opposite shitty attack from your enemy (We can call it Forgie’s Third Law). Anyway, the Japanese are bringing a ton of ships this time, so our favourite (and only in this iteration of CBR, but that’s beside the point) pirates still need to hold their breath, at least for now.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>And that’s what happens when you neglect your own island. Venezuela found Barcelona, taking advantage of the absence of Haiti. Shame on you Haiti, that’s what you deserve for making peace instead of conquering Caracas.</p><p> </p><p>We can also see the Aztec pushing against Maracay, but the vegetation is helping the defenders.</p><p></p><p>The Iroquois settle Akwesasne and have unlocked their second UU; for sure he’ll be useful in their current conflict, if used properly.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Algerian sandwich"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>And now, let’s jump into the spicy news of this turn, anticipated by the notification bar. Algeria is the victim of a coalition involving Palmyra (for the moral support more than anything), Venice and last but ABSOLUTELY NOT least Songhai. Mascara seems a bit in trouble, but it will be at the very least a distraction for the Algerian forces, now sandwiched from the south by Askia and from the north by Dandolo.</p>"

  scene_title: "Fight in the Sahara"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>We can enjoy a better look of the Songhai core. Actually, is not exactly that scary, considering that both Tagdemt and Blida are surrounded by a good number of defending troops, while Taghaza is empty. Has Askia bitten more than it can chew?</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "I guess I was wrong"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>In this slide we can see why I should not be even considered for a position as Power Ranker or similar. The attack against Hyderabad, even if not finished, is becoming an utter defeat for Maratha. Now I’m sure that, having said that, the next turn the city will be conquered.</p><p></p><p>I’d like to point out that all the three capitals in this slide are having food problems; the infertile and hilly land of the region is not helping for sure.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Aztec are slowing pushing forward, bringing Ciudad Guayana into yellow. However, the window of opportunity for Montezuma is closing very quickly: reinforcements are coming to the battlefront at maximum speed.  </p><p></p><p>Also, Canton and Blue China are at peace now; we’ll see soon if the pirates have decided to give away Hong Kong again or have improved their diplomatic skills. </p>"

  scene_title: "Jahkamaargh"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>At a quick glance, I’d be prone to say these two nations are at peace, as only a few damaged units hint the opposite situation. Only two units are in enemy territory, south of Jahkamahkke (and I really hope this is the last time I need to write the name of this city, two is more than enough). The Vikings are using their horses to directly attack the enemy city. Another display of tactical brilliance, nothing new.</p><p></p><p>Madagascar has accepted that playing on its islands is better than exploring the main continent, and agree to make peace with Beta Israel.</p>"

  narration: "<p>At least someone is playing their cards well right now. The Kazakhs place a very good Citadel outside Ergun, now in the red. The survivors of Genhe’s siege are also approaching the city from the south, outweighing the tiny defensive forces. </p><p></p><p>On a completely unrelated note: happy birthday Sitting Jesus! We now are in the first Anno Domini. I wonder if we’ll see some resurrections like Mk.2</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Canton keeps Hong Kong. The fact that I felt the need to remark it speaks for itself. It’s really a shame, the pirates are fighting very well given their position, but only have three cities and no more room for expansion. It’s difficult they’ll be considered actual contender in the future. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The previous turn, Libya has declared war against Nubia. The latter continues its personal challenge against the Evenks and Canton of “Most hated civ for absolutely no reason”. I have a theory: everybody dislikes Nubia because they didn’t settle the Suez Canal. I would be pissed too, to be fair. Anyway, somehow Nubia has destroyed a citadel outside Derna; Libya replies by attacking Nuri. Composite bowmen rush to defend the city, which is dangerously isolated from the rest of Nubian core. </p><p></p><p>The city of Gurnia still stands, but is brought into red. I wonder how many arrows the composite bowmen sitting on Cyprus have thrown against the city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I’d like to find a single positive thing to write for the Algerian given this slide. I’ll go with the beautiful shape of Tlemcen territory. Very aesthetic, it weirdly remind me of IRL India somehow. As for the actual fight, I’ll be surprised if the city won’t fall in Askia’s hands next turn.</p>"

Let’s see if the execution will be as good as needed. But maybe this is asking too much to the AI of this game, but you can never know; I still remember the perfect usage of the Panama canal by the Buccaneers in Mk2 in order to conquer Tulum.</p><p></p><p>Also, the battle for the control of Australia has ended.

  narration: "<p>Scotland builds the Great Hadrian Wall, declaring they’ll make the Manx pay for it. Now, if only you could also move those settlers you built like 35 turns ago. Just look at the Moors, how are they more willing than you to navigate in cold waters?</p><p></p><p>The notification bar is filled with agreements, friendships and denunciations, so two important notifications are hidden: the Goths and Prussia jointly declare war against the Turks. The shared border is short, but this still means our little green friend is now at war against three different Civs. </p>"

  scene_title: "Italian Standoff"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode8-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>We can see the Venetian core in all its beauty. With the newish cities of Ragusa and Mazzorbo, the Doge has locked down Italy (beside a few tiles in IRL Puglia and Basilicata), and there is another settler near Burano. Eight cities is more than several Civs can say to own, tbh.</p><p></p><p>“Corsica is not part of Italy, after all” say the Moors, bringing a settler near the island. A Morricone’s soundtrack echoes in the air, as a three-way standoff takes place, between Venetian units, the Moor settler and a Shongai scout. I’d love to see Venice just buy the tile, tbh. </p><p>Venice seems a bit behind in tech. His strong navy, currently directed to Algeria, won’t be enough without more advanced units.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Czech still hold strongly in Liberec and Ostrava, both in the yellow but at the same time not in danger of an immediate flip.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>Barcelona is not in immediate danger, but the same can’t be said for Maracay. Finally, the Aztecs surrounded the city, now in yellow. Only some Venezuelan triremes are floating around, and they could potentially flip the city a couple of times if needed.</p><p></p><p>When I said “using properly” a few slides ago, I didn’t mean “sending your UU alone against the whole enemy army”, for Hiawatha’s sake!</p>"

  narration: "<p>The assault to Tlemcen proceeds as expected. I honestly admire the dedication of Algeria to found new cities and not just roll over and die, but it could have picked better positions. Well, it probably was in a very long distance race against the Yup'ik. </p><p>“The one who founds further from home wins” </p>"

  narration: "<p>Ndongo relaunch its offensive against Esi another time, following one of the secret techniques of him, handed down from father to son: “bring a settler to the front”.</p><p>Well, it’s working for them, even if I’d give the merits to the actual militarized units. Still, the forest makes moving unit a headache, so Benin can enjoy the ownership of the town for at least another couple of turns, as no melee units are directly under the walls of the city.</p><p></p><p>Zimbabwe founded Bambandyanalo, therefore submitting his candidature to the context “Longest city name”.

Haiti breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the VOODOO.</p><p></p><p>Really, you can’t never know wether Toussaint is able to move smartly or badly his troops. This time, the coin flip declares “smartly”.</p><p></p><p>The worst thing about a Civ that is only good sometimes is that this can lead to losing, not winning, etc. I give this solid analysis to you for free, thanks me later. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Maturìn is gonna fall soon, possibly even next turn, as half of its health is taken out instantly. If Haiti will also concentrate his army against Barcelona, it’ll become somehow relevant. I’m a little afraid this war is slowly but surely killing too many soldiers for the Caribbean Civ. Toussaint needs to devote more production towards his military forces.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Venetian attack to Algeria has been a complete disaster, but the Doge is still sending his triremes in a suicide mission. Before the war, every tile in the Tyrrhenian Sea had a boat on top of it. Dandolo’s frustration his evident, and he decides to denunce Minoa, the last obstacle to an Italian unification. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The HRE places such a good citadel outside Cologne, and the Moors replies with one between Saraqustah and Tulaytulah. For sure more defensive, but a German push is now very unlikely, also considering the Moors have way more troops in the region. Maybe the HRE should consider a peace agreement with the Czech.</p>"

There is some fish and two atholls, so the spot is not as bad as can appear at first glance. Given the Deity bonuses, obviously; a human player could never found a city there and get away with it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I count units of eleven different Civs, not bad. The Evenks have founded two more cities, Tulihe and the one on the left corner, only partially visible (at least, I suppose is new given the defence points). While the war against the Kazakhs is not a success at the moment, they’re still expanding.</p><p></p><p>The Khanate, imitates the deer mounters and adds Oronar to its empire, with another settler ready, and even Korea has another settler out. I wonder where the Yup'ik colonists went, instead. </p>"

They still have a good army and now Spartacus is helping with its military genius, but, spoiler, he died IRL as soon as the Romans sent a real Legion against him. </p><p>If Geronimo declares war and Hiawatha remembers to move his units, it would be the end for Táhera.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We have a Religion map! This is the first time, so let’s take a look. </p><p>Sunni is taking over not only Africa, but it starts spreading in Europe too. Libya stronk.  It’s competing west against Nestorianism, founded by Algeria, and Judaism in the south-east. </p><p>Mainland Europe is atheistic, as Venetian Catholicism isn’t spreading much and the blue Eastern Orthodoxy is followed in only three cities.</p><p>Completely different is the situation in Middle East, dominated by Oriental Orthodoxy. This is probably the only time I mentioned something done by the Seljuq in the whole episode. </p><p>A bit north, the brown region represent Samānism, the biggest religion right now in terms of cities, while the purple is Confucianism.</p><p>Oceania is slowly adopting Bogomilism, founded by the Sulu, even if part of Australia prefers Tjukurpa. </p><p>North America is divided into two groups; the majority believe in Orenda on the east, but on the west somebody thinks the true religion is Angakkunngurniq istead. I wrote it, so Dawkinzz will be forced to pronounce it. Good luck with that. </p><p>South America is instead monoreligious, as Catharism is spreading throughout the continent.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We complete this episode with the remaining religions.</p><p></p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this part as much I enjoyed writing it. If not, I beg your pardon as it was my first experience in narrating. For sure, this was probably the biggest part so far, with over one hundred slides, and we saw a lot of action. And it’s only the beginning: as fewer and fewer tiles are free, war becomes the only solution.</p>"
