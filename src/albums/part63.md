  narration: |-
    Welcome ladies and gentlemen to Part 63 of the Civ Battle Royale with cheese!  This is your narrator, /u/bigkr88, otherwise known as the Unflaired, because stupid reddit won‘t show my buccs flair that I‘ve been wanting to wave loudly and proudly for months.  Again, this is an emergency narration, but as I‘ve been wanting to do this for a long while and I caught TPangs message right as it arrived, so, let‘s get it on!
    Title card by /u/Cadellinman
- scene_number: "2"
  scene_title: Image 02
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene02.jpg
  narration: Now for this wonderful hexagonal map of the cylinder, where I would like
    to point out just how screwed the Blackfoot are if the Inuit decide to bring the
    long night to them, just how many random paratrooper snipes Finland has pulled
    off, and how absolutely wonderful that Vietnamese/Australian throwdown will hopefully
    be this part!  Presuming, of course, that its not a bunch of embarked land units
    drowning before they even see land.
- scene_number: "3"
  scene_title: Image 03

  narration: 'As usual, the #1 civ on the power rankings, which is unsurprisingly
    the Inuit, what with their zombie armies and nukes made of ice and fissionable
    atomic baby seal tears.'
- scene_number: "4"
  scene_title: Image 04
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene04.jpg
  narration: For a new addition to the Battle Royale parts that I personally hope
    will be sticking around, military comparisons!  First up, Australia vs Vietnam,
    where the numbers seem decisively in Australia‘s favor in terms of sheer military
    size. Remember, though, that the Vietnamese core is closer to the front line,
    which would theoretically allow Vietnam to bring more of their manpower to bear.
- scene_number: "5"
  scene_title: Image 05
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene05.jpg
  narration: However, Vietnam is also fighting/trouncing their weakened neighbor Persia
    to the west, in a fun little three way scuffle since Sparta decided to run their
    daily ironman marathon east.  While Vietnam has not had the long distance conquests
    of civs like the Buccaneers or Finland, they have shown a fair amount of dedication
    towards taking on weakened land neighbors, and have amassed one of the more impressive
    contiguous empires of the cylinder, short of the Inuit and the Boers.  If this
    war goes as well as expected, we may not be too far off from seeing the sisters
    invading Europe itself!
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: Image 06
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene06.jpg
  narration: So, all of that out of the way, lets get to some proper throwdowns!  First
    we turn to the Persian kerfuffles, where Persepolis is firmly in Vietnam‘s grasp
    and Gordum and Susa, while being damaged, remain unlikely to flip, at the least
    not permanently.  Further west it would appear that Sparta is having trouble putting
    together a proper offensive, on top of there being a wall of Ethiopian and Mongolian
    peacekeepers in the way.  Granted, Persia‘s assets near Ecbatana consist mostly
    of machine guns and artillery with only a single great war infantry for the purposes
    of melee and.... is that a colonist?  What, is Persia planning on burning down
    Artashat and planting a fresh city to fill the gap?
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene07.jpg
  narration: As for Vietnam‘s other war, it is looking every bit as entertaining as
    we had hoped.  Virtually all of the island cities on this slide are heavily damaged,
    and Vietnam‘s military access through Blackfoot seas is proving to be advantageous
    as we can see a submarine having slipped by already north of Baguo, with more
    on their way.  Meanwhile, unites are pouring over the bottom right of the screen,
    with Diggers as far as the eye can see.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene08.jpg
  narration: To the north, we see more of Vietnam‘s core, and we get an idea of just
    how vast both sides air power is.  More cities are in the red or have the pure
    black health bars of doom, and with Australian paratroopers on hand, we may see
    Cebu and possibly Vigan flip here before long. This is the thunderdome brawl we‘ve
    been waiting for, folks!
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene09.jpg
  narration: This region is a hotbed of hostilities, as the teched up Koreans are
    fighting a two front war against the Mongolians and the Japanese, the Mongolian
    city of Turfan at the upper left already in the red with X-Coms bearing down on
    it, the Japanese citadel of Osaka being crushed by the Korean strike force.  The
    Japanese have enough privateers in the sea to the east to potentially flip their
    last city a few times, but we may need to ready the F keys regardless.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene10.jpg
  narration: Now for a shot of the Blackfoot nation, which at this point appears strong
    enough to be able to resist another Mexican tequila-fueled invasion.  The Blackfoot
    have actually carpeted fairly well, all things considered; it is fair to say that
    they are the new Nights Watch for the Cylinder, just without the massive wall
    and the Canadian stronghold of Winterfell having already fallen.  So, basically
    the same situation smart money is saying the Nights Watch will be in come the
    middle of season 7.  The only other thing to point out is the mass of Vietnamese
    units making a beeline for the North American coast and the skirmishing between
    the Vietnamese and the Austalians throughout Inuit and Blackfoot territory.  In
    a match between two cylinder juggernaughts, nowhere is safe.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene11.jpg
  narration: Now we turn back to the Korean invasion of Mongolia, where Genghis Khan
    and Meiji have decided to make peace and unite against their mutual enemy, not
    that it will do either of them any good.  Its raining X-Coms all throughout the
    southern Mongolian territory, with Beijing and Shanghai both taking heavy damage
    and looking to fall soon.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene12.jpg
  narration: In the north, the Mongolians are actually managing to hold the line with
    some success, and are actually making a push towards Guangzhou.  If you look at
    the minimap, it would appear Osaka remains standing as well.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene13.jpg
  narration: Of course right as I say that, Korea proceeds to launch a fresh offensive
    past Guangzhou and now looks to be able to take Otrar and Turfan in the north,
    and Beijing in the south, with Shanghai firmly in Korea‘s hands and surrounded
    by X-Coms.  The number of Boer peacekeepers forming a human wall just west of
    the doomed cities, though, will prove to be quite the hindrance to further conquests...
    until the X-Coms jump right over them.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene14.jpg
  narration: Highlighting Sparta‘s recent conquests and failed conquests, we can see
    that unless either Persia or Sparta commit more to the Gaza front their war will
    soon stagnate.  Armenia is looking significantly worse for the wear, with only
    a handful of machine guns and a mostly pointless navy on hand that isn‘t even
    in the right body of water to hit Sparta when that war reignites.  In the eastern
    Mediterranean, though, we can see that Sparta‘s navy is actually pretty decent
    for the region, despite a few anachronistic ships most likely due to a lack of
    gold to upgrade them with.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene15.jpg
  narration: Back to the Osaka front, we can see that Japan somehow remains alive
    after the initial Korean push, though Osaka is near death and a unit of cavalry
    is all that stands between the city and a unit of Korean railgun armor.  Is anyone
    else envisioning a recreation of the end of The Last Samurai, just with a LOT
    more red mist?  And hopefully with Tom Cruise not inexplicably surviving afterwards
    with all his limbs still attached?  Regardless, in a sign of solidarity, both
    Sri Lanka and Tibet have made peace with the doomed Japanese, though they have
    declined to participate in Meiji‘s upcoming seppuku for fear of sniping the city
    out from under Vietnam by accident.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene16.jpg
  narration: So, Mongolia and Sri Lanka have decided after surviving a war that they
    probably shouldn‘t have that they need to flex their muscles to scare off any
    other invaders. They could have hit Persia, but Ecbatana is actually kinda heavily
    guarded and they have some trade happening there, so scratch that off the list.  Sparta‘s
    got a truce going, Sibir is a gigantic NNNNNOPE.  But, luckily, a few helpless
    Mongolian and Sri Lankan units were chilling out nearby, and so strongly worded
    letters were sent and Armenian film crews set up to shoot some videos for propaganda
    film of Mongolian and Sri Lankan units fleeing before the might of the Armenian
    military!  Until the Mongolians started shooting missiles at them, that is.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene17.jpg
  narration: Welp, folks, show‘s over, pack it up and go home.  David is now Jesus,
    and he plopped his holy buttocks right in Gaza, which is a war torn hellhole analogous
    to the modern day Gaza strip.  I feel like we‘ve now officially seen everything.  Gotta
    hand it to the Persians, though, it is a brilliant way for them to shut down the
    Spartan offensive, while still giving them avenues of attack through Armenian
    territory.  It doesn‘t do any good for Pasargadae, where the weather forecast
    is calling for Vietnamese paratroopers all week, but one problem at a time.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene18.jpg
  narration: Ethiopian peacekeepers are flooding into the Gaza strip to protect their
    newly arisen Jewish saviour, and Pasargadae falls, splitting the Persian empire
    in half.  It may be that the revival of David was Persia‘s last act of defiance,
    an act to stymie Vietnam‘s conquest westward and save Europe from the ruthless
    aggression of the Trung Sisters.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene19.jpg
  narration: Now back to South America, where short of Tiwanaku flipping back not
    too much had developed on this front until Pedro decided to finish off his weakened
    neighbor to the south!  Already Brazilian paratroopers are landing amidst O‘Higgens
    forces, and the cities of La Plata and Castro start to weaken amidst accusations
    that Brazil is poisoning Chile‘s water supply with the Zika virus!  Not that anyone
    would be surprised by such an action; in the cylinder, only the ruthless survive.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene20.jpg
  narration: While this is obviously a pretty one-sided annexation, Brazil may not
    be coming out of this unscathed.  Their navy is actually mostly nonexistant, a
    few nuclear subs hiding amongst a fleet of embarked units; the destroyers of Chile
    will be having a field day, in what is shaping up to be a truly ideal blaze of
    glory for them.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene21.jpg
  narration: Back to the Vietnamese-Australian front, cities remain burning and torn
    to bits, especially on Australia‘s side of the conflict.  Most likely due to the
    air force of drone fighters and stealth bombers which, based on the fact that
    multiple cities that have 10 air unites each in them probably explains how the
    Australian cities are being so badly hammered.  Whangarei and Davao are both looking
    pretty tenuous at this point.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene22.jpg
  narration: To the north, Australia‘s cities are getting crumped hard, but an absolutely
    massive swarm of units is blocked in by Australia‘s island cities.  Nearby, the
    Inuit look on the conflict with malice, an arsenal ship loaded with 3 ice and
    seal tears atomic missiles at the ready.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene23.jpg
  narration: The White Walkers role in the Australian-Vietnamese conflict is rather
    peculiar, seeing as their lands are playing host to rather meaningless skirmishes
    in North America and in eastern Siberia.  What exactly the two are fighting over
    this far north is a mystery, given the heavy levels of radiation that are leftover
    from the Yakutia-Inuit wars from before.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene24.jpg
  narration: In Mongolia, the war is remaining somewhat back and forth, as Turfan
    in the north may flip a few times, Otrar‘s position is looking tenuous, and the
    Boer wall of human shields continue to frustrate Korea‘s attempts at doing a full
    court press on Mongolia‘s territory.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene25.jpg
  narration: Persia attempts to link their territory together again successfully,
    recovering Pasargadae, though Typhoon Trungs continues to rain on their parade.  Mongolia
    is actually managing to get a fair number of units near Armenian territory, and
    with a melee unit or two more, we may actually see one of the longest distance
    captures with no ships or paratroopers involved.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene26.jpg
  narration: A shot of Iceland‘s core, consisting of Iceland, where they too appear
    to be suffering from empty carrier syndrome like their carribean counterpart the
    Buccaneers.  And for the wardecs, there is Iceland declaring war on Sparta, which
    based on how many paratroopers they can launch would be able to chew up the Spartan
    interior, and... oh.... oh no... the Boers... they‘ve declared war on leg day
    memes.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene27.jpg
  narration: Iceland‘s path to Sparta is unfortunately clogged up by an absolute mountain
    of Finnish and Australian expats.  Italy and Greece seem rather well populated,
    so for the moment Sparta‘s core appears to be rather durable.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene28.jpg
  narration: The Boers, on the other hand, have a very easy path to attack Sparta‘s
    African holdings, with an absolutely horrifying air force and a strike group of
    X-coms ready to pounce on Utique and Carthage.  As a side note, I‘d like to point
    out that the Buccaneers are starting to populate some of their recent conquests
    with power armor infantry, which is actually comparable to the Boers in tech level
    if not manpower.  Definitely moreso than the Spartans, at least.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene29.jpg
  narration: Down in the former Sri Lanka, the global conflict between Australia and
    Vietnam has another front as Vietnamese paratroopers are meeting with some success
    as Galle comes close to falling, though that won‘t last if Vietnamese don‘t get
    reinforcements over soon.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene30.jpg
  narration: The Boers have a Giant Death Robot in a very odd position, on the western
    edge of the Indian ocean.  The reason... Pacific Rim 3.  The Inuitpocalypse is
    cancelled again.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene31.jpg
  narration: Back to the southern tip of South America, Chile is folding like a house
    of cards.  Every city except for Concepoon are getting damaged, La Serena has
    fallen, and Santiago De Chile may start flipping between the mechanized infantry
    of Chile and Brazilian paratroopers.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene32.jpg
  narration: At the Sri Lankan front, Galle and Colombo are looking rather vulnerable
    and the Vietnamese fleet seems to be just sitting at the sea border, not fully
    committing to the fight.  Again, Vietnamese can make some permanent gains here,
    they just need to commit the manpower.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene33.jpg
  narration: We get a full view of the Mediterranean Sea, and as before, Iceland is
    having trouble bringing their full force to bear due to the number of expats in
    mainland Europe, and the Boers so far haven‘t pierced Spartan core.  The disturbing
    bit on this slide, though, is Iceland having loaded up Ravenna with atomic bombs,
    with a very juicy Greece to the immediate south.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene34.jpg
  narration: Hawaii‘s conclave of Kaneohe remains somewhat stable, given that no one
    is actively trying to remove them from the Cylinder, but as the carrier numbers
    rise and the Inuit glacier floats nearby, any chance of a comeback is pointless.  To
    the top left, you can see the Vietnamese start to overtake the northern Australian
    islands, with apparently few Australian melee units to contest them.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene35.jpg
  narration: Mongolia and Korea continue to grind away at each other, with Korea having
    the definite upper hand thanks to their tech.  Mongolia‘s lost about a quarter
    of their landmass so far having Shanghai and Beijing drop in the south, Otrar
    and Turfan firmly in Korea‘s hands, and the Boer human chain has broken leaving
    Tabriz vulnerable, if Korea can slice through the horde of ranged and AA units.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene36.jpg
  narration: Off the coast of China, Vietnam‘s navy has worn thing, though the mass
    of units to the top right capturing Caloocan and coming close to flipping Manila,
    and the stream of units at the bottom of the slide are threatening Myson and Ambon.  Also,
    one of Tpangs friends is playing 8-bit armies, and I was very tempted by that
    game during the steam summer sale.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene37.jpg
  narration: Chile continues to hold out surprisingly well, though as can be seen
    by the slowly emptying southern tip of South America its only a matter of time
    until Brazil rolls over O‘Higgins nation.  Even if they don‘t, eventually Australia
    will send a big enough force to actually threaten Chile‘s west coast, four submarines
    and a digger notwithstanding.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene38.jpg
  narration: To the northwest of the previous slide.... oh wow.  I‘m very curious
    as to why Australia hasn‘t dropped the hammer on Chile with all of this within
    a few turns travel.  This isn‘t even purely a horde of floating infantry, Chile‘s
    navy is nonexistant compared to the submarines and destroyers just around Hervey
    Bay.  Its just a matter of racing Brazil‘s forces.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene39.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile back in Mongolia, Genghis has actually managed to push back
    for a brief moment, retaking Turfan and Beijing and sporting an airforce which
    iiiis probably outdated compared to the airforce in China, which is approximately
    4x larger in comparison on this front alone.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene40.jpg
  narration: Sibir‘s core, and some of Mongolia‘s northern enclaves, is looking pretty
    horrifying.  Should Sibir decide to strike Mongolia, the war would be short, bloody,
    and probably the nail in the coffin for Mongolia.  Right now, the one thing I
    feel is holding Mongolia together is the fact that they‘re taking on just Korea;
    if any of their neighbors who are stronger than Mongolia decide to jump in, it
    would be a bloodbath.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene41.jpg
  narration: A hush falls over the Babylonian sub Nebuchadnezzar as a Brazilian nuclear
    submarine armed with a zika missile passes near the mountains barricading us away
    from the rest of the cylinder.  Do they know that they are trapped in this game
    for our amusement?
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene42.jpg
  narration: In the Mediterranean Sea, Utique looks close to falling as a few teams
    of X-Coms clean up the Spartan units in Africa.  As much as Rome and Manitea are
    getting hammered, Iceland‘s robot infantry is still having trouble cutting through
    the Spartan units, and there is little hope of timely reinforcements.  I would
    like to also point out the beautiful Buccaneer navy, and conveniently ignore the
    empty Iberian landscape.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene43.jpg
  narration: Looking back to Persia, we see things have continued to go sour as Vietnam
    has retaken Persepolis and Pasagardae, and Baghdad looks close to falling to Vietnamese
    paratroopers.  The Persian navy is trapped in the gulf, sadly unable to actually
    threaten any of the captured cities along the coast due to a lack of melee.  Gaza
    and the Messiah stand tall, protected by loyal Ethiopian zealots, a beacon of
    peace in a chaotic world.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene44.jpg
  narration: Utique falls, and two more X-Coms stand ready to breach and clear Carthage.  While
    its not the steamroll that would be expected, it is a remarkable demonstration
    of the Boer‘s ability to apply the military aspect of economy of force, committing
    only the necessary amount of units to achieve a set objective.  Removing the tradition
    of leg day from Africa, where every day is actually Kenyan Marathon day.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene45.jpg
  narration: Iceland is trying really hard to put pressure on Sparta, they really
    are, the problem is they just can‘t throw enough paratroopers into Italy, with
    most of the damage being done by the decent air wing stationed in Ravenna.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene46.jpg
  narration: The eastern Indian ocean is seeing an escalation of arms, as Australia
    commits atomic bombs to the front, presumably relaying the bomb through carriers
    with the final destination being Sri Lanka, the ultimate final destination the
    bomb being the city with the unpronouncable name so we never have to attempt it
    again.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene47.jpg
  narration: A flotilla of Australian ships head west towards the horn of Africa,
    perhaps to strike at Chile‘s east coast, perhaps on a pleasure cruise.  Regardless,
    they bring at least one of the dreaded drone fighters.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene48.jpg
  narration: The east of Lagstralia, double stacks of naval and amphibious land units,
    a large force of units whose battlecry of ‘THE PANG IN THE SOUTH!‘ as they prepare
    to strike out at Vietnam.  In addition, we recieve confirmation that the lost
    capital is that of Chile, as South America slowly collapses to Brazil under the
    promise of an eternal Carnival.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene49.jpg
  narration: Nope, Australia was the one to take the city, with a surprise Advanced
    Destroyer from nowhere.  While it will probably flip back, it says a lot about
    the lack of strength in Chile‘s west coast that a small force could take the capital.  Now
    imagine what this war would look like if Australia‘s forces to the northwest actually
    attacked.

  narration: CHARLES, GO AWAY.  WE‘RE WATCHING ARMIES ANNIHILATE EACH OTHER MERCILESSLY
    FOR OUR AMUSEMENT.  YOU ARE WHY WE CAN‘T HAVE GLORIOUS THINGS.  YOU ARE THE NAVAL
    AI OF OUR LIVES.  YOU ARE THE ROME OF THE CIVBATTLEROYALE WITH CHEESE.  Also Vietnam
    and Australia continue to tear each other apart south of the Japanese islands,
    with Iloilo and Gladstone looking rather tenuous.

  narration: A Mexican flotilla brushes past the Hawaiian enclave of peace and rum,
    consisting of a mix of units that would actually pose a threat to an isolated
    island city state.  If Mexico is making preparations for the imminent Inuit invasion,
    it would make sense... if they had any hope of escaping the White Walker‘s naval
    glacier.

  narration: Those robotic units really put in the work, with Iceland actually pushing
    through and capturing Rome from Sparta!  Sparta has the manpower to take it back,
    but, the proud Icelandic droid has given Leonidas cramps.  A man who gets cramps
    can be defeated.  To the bottom left, Boer and Spartan units continue to battle
    over Carthage, the capital site a prize worth fighting tooth and nail and robotic
    appendage over.  As the Boers are the ones with robotic appendages, they have
    an advantage in this regard.

  narration: With that said, the Boers have not only taken Carthage, but scattered
    the nearby Spartan units, making any flips of the city a daunting prospect.  The
    question is now whether they will follow through and push into southern Italy,
    or maintain their gains in Africa.  I say its about damn time the Boers start
    breaking into new continents.

  narration: South of Japan, the naval conflict rages on, with Vietnam‘s core continuing
    to crank out reinforcements and putting pressure on Australia, while Aussie reinforcements
    trickle in, including... a nuclear armed missile, presumably loaded with native
    Australian spiders.  You wouldn‘t.  TPang, your people... they wouldn‘t.  Would
    they?

  narration: In the world news, the ban on Jade was not passed, with virtually all
    of Asia amongst the major participants in the World Congress voting against it.  The
    back and forth struggle between Korea and Mongolia continues unabated, with Shanghai
    falling back into Mongolian hands for the first time this part and Beijing in
    serious risk of falling again.  Both sides seem to have not exhausted their military
    capabilities yet, though I will note a significantly larger number of melee units
    in Korea‘s military than that of Mongolia.

  narration: The other edict was a ban on cocoa, which hits the South American markets
    rather hard, though humorously Chile voted in favor of it, presumably trying to
    give Brazil one more good bruise before the annexation is over.  Australia, the
    Buccaneers, and Brazil are in a race to claim Valparaiso, as Buenos Aires and
    La Plata drop to tenuous health levels, each passing slide showing fewer and fewer
    Chilean units.  Its entirely possible Chile may survive as a city state in Arica,
    but, I wouldn‘t hold out hopes of the backdoor squad pulling any miracles.

  narration: Embarassed by their defeats, Leonidas leads his Spartans in a counterattack
    that takes back Rome, a line of Finnish peacekeepers making any chance of Iceland
    flipping it back questionable without Icelandic units with the move to reach past
    them.  In addition, the impressive navy of the Spartans pushes back towards Carthage
    and looks poised to retake it, though the Boers have already begun to fill up
    their newest conquest with Paratroopers and X-Coms.

  narration: Our spies are reporting back with gems like the Buccaneers plotting against
    Sparta and Mexico, both of which would be interesting, Sparta moreso.  The Buccaneers
    have an impressive navy and a small but advanced army at the Mediterranean, making
    a strike against a weakened Sparta to take Italy rather feasible.  Mexico is the
    more recent plot, though, and that too would be an interesting conquest, given
    that it would expose the Buccaneers to a larger land border with the Inuit.

  narration: Streaming past Finnish border guards before they could ask for passports,
    a pair of Icelandic Railgun Armor units has taken Rome!  Sparta‘s position in
    Italy is still somewhat strong, but it remains notable that Iceland is finally
    able to put enough units towards making a meaningful offensive against Sparta.

  narration: The Battle of Valparaiso rages on, Chilean mechanized infantry finding
    themselves caught in the open against Buccaneer Advanced Destroyers and Australian
    submarines while Brazilian paratroopers hop over the mountains in mass.  Can I
    just say, that I can‘t wait for Chile to be knocked out so I can tell the difference
    between their units and the Buccs?  Seriously, the two helicopters to the left,
    I can‘t tell if they‘re Buccs or Chileans.

  narration: A brave Persian privateer actually manages to seize Susa momentarily,
    perhaps in a bid to buy time for Baghdad to stabilize after the last Vietnamese
    wave was fought off.  To the top left, Persian units seem to be retreating into
    the Armenian heartland abandoning Ectabana to its fate, the sign of the collapse
    of the Persian empire.  In the meantime, Mongolian artillery continues to take
    potshots at Armenians for fun and profit.

  narration: Further south of Baghdad Vietnamese paratroopers fight to keep a landing
    zone open for reinforcements, knowing full well one more push against Baghdad
    will be all thats needed.  Behold, fellow Babylonians, the courage of the gladiators
    that fight for our amusement.

  narration: We get a pretty sweet shot now of Vietnam‘s northern frontier and Sibir‘s
    south to get a comparison between the two.  In terms of raw technology, Sibir‘s
    power armor has a definite edge, making an early conflict heavily favoring our
    northern friends.  However, those mountains make reinforcements have to go through
    a funnel, making holding Bamda and Nyingchi difficult, Urgench and Nishapur vital.  At
    this point, I will give the advantage to whoever captures Afghanistan first; if
    its Vietnam, they get an extra avenue of attack into Sibir‘s heartland.  If Sibir,
    they get a wider front to fill with units against Vietnam.  Way to go, Afghanistan;
    your one iota of importance is who annexes you first.

  narration: That is a LOT of atomic bombs that Iceland has packing.  Which means
    that is a very boned southern Italy.  It does bring to mind, what would Iceland
    name their atomic bombs after?  Frost giants?  Ancient Inuit necromancers that
    are used in ghost stories to scare children?  Modern Inuit ‘biologists‘?  Inquiring
    minds want to know.

  narration: |-
    As our final slide full of action and drama and conflict, we look to the south of Japan once more, where Vietnamese forces have captured Iloilo and look to have the manpower on hand to keep it, while at the same time sending units east past Australia‘s islands in what might be an envelopment, or at the least an attempt to cut the Japanese islands off from reinforcements. More Australian reinforcements can be seen flooding in from the south, so this battleground is nowhere close to being decided yet, but the Vietnamese have made some good headway thus far.
    Hidden off in the corner reveals that Australia has declared war on Leonidas! It also just so happens that there are some Australian paratroopers in Europe at the moment too. Could we see some more intercontinental sniping efforts by a leader named Henry?

  narration: But now, join me in celebrating the return of INFOADDICTS!!!! For sheer
    landmass, Australia remains the undisputed king thanks to their dominance of the
    Pacific, far ahead of even the Inuit who have blanketed North America in the Long
    Night. The Boers and the Buccs are surprisingly on par with each other, while
    Iceland Sibir and Vietnam form the next grouping.

  narration: Next, military manpower, where we have a few surprises, like the Inuit
    actually being edged out by Vietnam, and the Buccs having fallen below Sweden
    and Iceland, most likely due to the carriers in the Bucc fleet all being run on
    skeleton crews.

  narration: For sheer number of cities, the Inuit and Australia are actually neck
    and neck at 103 cities each, the next cluster of civs arriving at around 60 cities
    each. It is worth noting the Inuit cities may actually be worth somewhat less,
    given Australia‘s much larger territory implying that the Inuit cities are clustered
    much closer together.

  narration: And now for our city-states, Japan, Texas, Tibet, Hawaii, and the Gaza
    Strip, home to our new messiah David. While we didn‘t see Osaka fall yet, it may
    not be long before Korea knocks them out; otherwise, most of the other city states
    seem safe for the time being, thanks to either isolation, a decent military, or
    in the case of Israel a carpet of Ethiopian peacekeepers.

  narration: The Boers, as usual, lead us in raw SCIENCE!, far ahead of the Inuit
    despite the White Walker‘s advantage in cities. Granted, it would appear that
    the Boers are actually towards the end of the tech tree, given the presence of
    X-Coms, so as the game goes on this science lead will probably be much less valuable.
- scene_number: "71"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part63-scene71.jpg
  narration: At the bottom of the science rankings, the civs that evolution forgot.
    Sparta‘s presence near the bottom shows just how far they‘re falling behind at
    this point in the game given they‘re having to fight groups like the Boers and
    other top 10 civs, and are just strictly outclassed militarily despite any local
    advantages in manpower.

  narration: The Inuit currently lead the world in tourism, most likely due to their
    zombification of POWs who are then sent to wander the icy cold wastes of North
    America.

    on top, most likely due to rampant pillaging of the museums of civs like France
    and England.

    with the second coming of our messiah David in the holy Gaza strip, this trend
    will reverse.

  narration: Finally, the world religion map, where Catholicism is seen dominating
    the Americas, while pockets of southern Asia continue to remain atheistic, its
    people obviously abandoning any faith in the gods that have placed them in this
    cruel cylinder. ANYWAY! Deprime the F keys people, the part is over! Point in
    fact, we have ended this part with more civs than we started with, praise your
    Jewish Messiah David! This has been /u/bigkr88 bringing you an emergency narration,
    I care not for your petty criticisms, and I hope you‘re subjected by my meandering
    generalizations and godawful short term predictions again at some point in the
    future. GOODNIGHT!
