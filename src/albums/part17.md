  narration: "Hello everyone and welcome back to the r/civ Battle Royale Mk. II! I
    am your host, Aeternix (r/_Aeternix_) and today we will be doing something a little
    differently. There will be two styles of narration for this, the 17th part. One
    is from the perspective of Makru, a Babylonian historian/scientist who drafted
    the book “An Age of Fire: The History of the Unification Conflict”. The other
    will be under a heading called “The Facts” whereby I will give a more factual
    detailing of the events shown in the slide (a tl;dr portion, if you just want
    the events). The chapter which I will take from Makru’s book is the seventh chapter
    of the second volume: “When the Sun Rises”. I hope you will enjoy his . . . well,
    eccentric interpretation of the events he’s experienced from the submarine he
    calls home. \nAnd if you’re new to this corner of the internet, head on over to
    the subreddit (r/Civbattleroyale) and subscribe to become part of our Babylonian
    community! There are polandball comics, contests, a narration, games, and discussions
    all about how this world is being shaped (I even hear we’ll get a textbook soon!).
    \nSo, without further ado, I present to you the 17th part of the worldwide phenomenon!"

    An Excerpt from Makru’s Diary.
    1290 B.C: The two hundredth and twenty-first cycle onboard this isolated vessel. With news of illustrious support for Em’s exploits from the other members of our expedition, it becomes imperative to me that the recording of history be documented with care. I will not deny that this fragile world, filled with so many barbarians, calls out to be protected. However, it is my duty as a scientist - as a Babylonian far from home - to be partial in my observations and rigorous in my dedication to the study. It is a sacred rule that a Babylonian cannot interfer in the affairs of a world s/he is studying.
    However, there is no rule on documenting my opinions on these bloodthirsty savages. I write this term, of course, with as much partiality as I can muster.
    The Facts: A look at this wonderful map created by r/LacsiraxAriscal! Quite possibly my favourite map created thus far! Click to zoom in and see the placement of each city.

  narration: |-
    In the jungles outside of the Mayan capital, Palenque, the Fourth Hawaiian Koa Regiment waited. Their bone swords sharp and their bodies were tense at the prospect of another city acquired for their legion. With a full invasion fleet from Texas and the Buccaneers on their flanks, a soldier – let’s call him Alika, for it is my favourite Hawaiian name – approached his commanding officer. “Is not now the time?” he asked, his breath barely above a whisper. “Shouldn’t we take their floundering empire?” But their commander stood firm, watching the seas. He replied, “When the sun rises and the east sets, then we shall make our move.” When Alika conveyed this sentiment to the troops, he could not find any meaning in the statement. Neither can this historian, as a matter of fact!
    The Facts: The Hawaiian special units look confused beside Palenque. Maybe they wait for the Texans and Buccaneers to hurt the capital before the attack? Or maybe they are just throwing a party. Either way, they are clearly blocking any invasion forces from taking Palenque!

    However, while the Fourth Hawaiian Regiment debated the meaning of their commander’s words, the Buccaneers fought against the onslaught of Brazilian ships. The tropical island of Cartagena lay bare for the Brazilian triremes. Their hefty smiles glistening in the sun. “Forget the South!” a commander cried. “We march to the North!” Many men cheered, but failed to realize how pitiful their forces looked in comparison to the fully armed enemy galleons. Argentina sure weren’t about to warn them their either. Neither would I, if the choice came to me. Let them have their fun.
    The Facts: Cartagena is in the red and is surrounded by the Brazillian triremes! However, can Pedro manage to secure it into his empire? Argentina looks awfully eager!

    Across the world, cries shouted from Israel that – to no one’s surprise – Germany is not to be trusted (Hitler was said to be drying his tears with his kippah)! However, in North America, another voice echoed around the world: “Sitting Bull must perish!”. Although Sitting Bull has proved ineffective a war after their tussle with Canada, is it really a wise to provoke another war? This historian thinks not.
    The Facts: Germany is denounced by Israel and Crowfoot drags himself into another war with the Sioux. How smart is it really, to willingly fight a two-front war with a country that looks ready to shed blood? What is going through Crowfoot’s head?

  narration: |-
    Across the seas, Leonidas the Younger faced a decision. His gamble on taking Rome succeeded, but as the first to destroy a civilization, his people are not the bane of the Mediterranean. Arretium (which I heard was founded just to spite the Romans) is providing an important naval base for the Carthage fleets. The advanced navy is tearing through Sparta’s weakened forces. From the city of Arretium, showers of arrows fly upon the Spartan-occupied Antium. One might feel sorry for him, as his entire empire is under such scrutiny, but I for one believe the warmonger deserves it. Reason alone is the solution to any conflict. Though I will admit I have quite a few people I would enjoy clubbing over the head and watching as they tumble over to the ground and I continually hit them over and over and over an—Pardon me. I lost my composure for a second. Its tiring work to see it all, you understand.
    The Facts: Antium is being under quite the attack. Sparta is trying to defend it against Carthage, but we will see if it works. Portugal, as per usual, is doing nothing.

    Despite the needless bloodshed (oh, how gross it all is!) Tibet and Kimberly are now friends! Their preverbal handshake is mute as the massacre of Philippines around them. From the east, Australia is attacking, from the west is The Champa, and from the north the Trung Sister’s massive invasion fleet has begun to tango off of Manila. Jose Rizal is holding his empire together, but how long will it last when all your options are dwindling?
    The Facts: Though Australia is the only one so far of the three powers to really do any damage to the Philippine’s Northern Empire, the massive amount of ships coming from Vietnam and The Champa do not bode well for the Philippines.

    Hungry to melt the icy heart of the Inuit, the Empire of the Sun has taken the city of Sikutsipmaik. The burning desire of Japanese conquest surges against the North Winds, as the forces clash along the borders of Sikutsipmaik and Sanirajak! The powerful Japanese Galleons seem to be cutting through the Inuit triremes like a knife through warm butter, but as ice melts under the sun, so too it strengthens with the support of a cool northern breeze. And this breeze will bring with it reinforcements that will make this conflict even hotter! Yes, you are allowed to bask in the glow of my elemental puns. No, no you can’t have my autograph. I am a scientist, not a rock star!
    The Facts: The Japanese have surrounded Sikutsipmaik after taking it and are hungry for more cities. However, the large Inuit force to the north seems daunting. Will the Japanese be able to compete?

  narration: "In his chamber, with the simmering ashes of the book “How to Fight Wars
    Good” in his fireplace, Lincoln sips on his bitter coffee and reminisces. I can
    imagine his cheeks are worn, his skin pale, and his eyes beady from the countless
    insults from his Senate. He needs a victory to rally the people, but what? And
    then, a messenger arrives. He is sweating and declares that the Sioux have joined
    in on the Inuit’s war against The Blackfoot. With his lips pursed, Lincoln stands
    up and realizes what must be done. “Declare war against Sitting Bull! The world
    will respect us once again!” The speech is rousing, but the messenger refrains
    from telling Lincoln that there is no way for his forces to reach the landlocked
    Blackfoot (he really doesn’t want to hurt his confidence). I personally would
    have told him right then and there. Imagine the look on his face! \nPriceless.\nThe
    Facts: Lincoln declares war on Sitting Bull despite having no borders with him.
    I don’t think I need to explain how unexciting this purely political move is."

    With their armies resting beside the weakened Philippines, the Kimberly relax knowing that their friendship with Tibet will make the world realize how unlike Sparta they are. Within this relaxation their leader, Jandamarra, receives a message from the eastern border: “Australia’s country is open for attack! Let us strike now!” Jandamarra, unaffected, puts the message down and sips his tea. Maybe he will consider it, but people thinking he’s the next Sparta is definitely not his intention. I, for one, agree.
    The Facts: Look at those wide open plains! C’mon, Kimberley! You could easily take a city or two from Aust[REDACTED DUE TO EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM TPANGOLIN].

    The armies of his enemies at his capital’s gates, Osei Tutu begins to send out letters of peace to anyone who would listen. What he receives back is his crumpled letter with a picture of golden stood on the back. And no, I am not talking about the furniture. However, one letter slips into Ahmad Al-Mansur’s hands. Sadly though, the name Ashanti is crossed out in charcaol and replaced with “Ayyubids”. Ahmad, feeling pity, decides to declare peace with Saladin. The letter was written quite well, so it’s too bad an Ayyubid spy got to it first.
    The Facts: Good news and bad news. Bad news? The Ashanti Empire is collapsing and it will only be a matter of time before the capital is taken by the invading forces. Good news? The Ayybids have declared peace with Morocco after taking one of their cities. Take with it what you will.

    Armed with their upgraded soldiers, the Zulu’s Impi legion marches against The Kongo. Although their country is small, their invasion force looks ready to fight and take the spoils from Nzinga Mbande’s empire, who is too busy beating senselessly on Osei Tutu to care. See? This is what senseless violence gets you!
    The Facts: With their unique unit, the Zulu’s have started their march on Nkuna. There are no Kongo land units anywhere close to the city, so it looks like a great opportunity for Shaka here!

    realizes the opportunity that has presented itself to him. He drafts a documented
    made of ice and sends it to the Sioux. The message takes its long and arduous
    into Sitting Bull’s hands whereby most of it has been melted. By a single word:
    “peace?” remains engraved in the ice and with it melting in his hands Sitting
    Bull declares, “I accept!” A cheer of thousands rings around the camp as a new
    surge of excitement builds in the Sioux troops. \nMeanwhile, Blackfoot sends an
    angry letter made of buffalo fur to Lester B. Pearson of Canada, with the first
    line reading: “I know your scouts like spreading their maple syrup across the
    world, but does it have to interrupt the trading from my new city?”\nThe Facts:
    The Inuit declare peace with the Sioux so they can both focus on the Blackfoot.

    smiles with glee. A fellow sailor, however, cuts his celebration short by telling
    him of the Buccaneer just north of the city. The commander – let us call him Lucas,
    another good name – dismisses the report. “If they think they can stop us, let
    them!” An idea enters his head and whisks around to his map. “In fact, I have
    an even better idea!” He stabs a city, Parana with his knife. “We will take another
    city from them as well! Send a message to Pedro about our success!” The sailor
    does so and stifles his concerns. \nOutside, the Argentina navy begins to pop
    Champaign and place bets on who will win.\nThe Facts: Cartagenia is close to being
    taken and Brazil has begun to set their eyes on other Buccaneer cities."

    Knowing he is fighting against overwhelming odds. Jose Rizal of the Philippines stands atop his capital ship and speaks against the injustices of Australia. His speech touches many and his men begin to weep about their families and loved ones. In a bold move, his army strikes back against the Australian fleet, pushing them back. His men cheer and Jose turns towards his northern, southern, and western borders. “The worst, I fear, has yet to come. But, we will fight together as one!” He is an inspiring figure (one might say if they were not as impartial as I am).
    The Facts: Australia’s carvels have been repelled for now, but they are looking awfully close to Butuan. It is only a matter of time before we see if the Philippines can withstand these naval assaults.

    Osei Tutu’s son, Osei Tutu II, hears from an officer that the battle has been lost: Konongo has fallen. With tears in his eyes and his fist clenched, the fourteen year old boy takes command of the remaining armies around Denkyira and cements their courage. “If my father were here, he would know that this empire will not fall. Not without shedding the blood of every soldier who dares take it from us!” His mother behind him, the crowds cheer his name. And from the back, a messenger delivers a piece of folded paper. The boy looks at the letter and sees that another of his father’s peace offering got through: Nzinga of the Kongo has declared peace. “Thank you, my father,” he whispers into the letter.
    The Facts: The Mali have taken the Ashanti’s capital, Konongo, and now march to their last remaining city. However, they may still have a chance, as Kongo has backed out of the war prematurely, despite a sizable army. I think he’s only now just hearing the Zulu knocking on their door.

    While one son cheers, another curses his luck. Leonidas the Younger hears from his secret lava base that Antium has been taken by Carthage. In his fury, he demands that all ships are sent to defend the city. A foolish gesture, I think, but I will still applaud him for his endurance. A warmonger never knows, I suppose when to quit.
    The Facts: Carthage takes Antium from Sparta! And are those Portuguese vessels I spy in the north? Not that they will do anything, mind you. Still, it’s nice to see at least they are being moved every turn.

    region. Watching Sibir and Timurids fight feels like watching two cats scratch
    over a red dot on the floor. Sure, there are metals around those mountains, but
    who would want to live in such a miserable region? I mean, the amount of conflict
    over these cities surrounded by deserts and now Afghanistan is building up their
    troops to attack? \nI, for one, cannot see the value in such wasteful lands. Now
    would not be a good time to tell me I live in a submarine. I know I do. I don’t
    want to. No, you are not allowed to laugh at my situation.\nThe Facts: The Timurids
    look in a pinch when it comes to their neighbors. There are at least five countries
    who have declared war on them (three of which have borders to them) and their
    forces consist of mostly ranged units. It will be interesting to see if they can
    pull off a victory."

    and wounded the cities of Multan and Shahrisabz. Timur rushes to the front lines,
    realizing his massive lands full of such wonderful vegetation and life are being
    risked. Who would not try and protect such a bountiful, lush landscape that begs
    only the best minds to create poems and songs about the great majesty of their
    splendor? \nOutrageous! I defy the accusations you assert on me. I say all these
    things without a single ounce of bias. Scientist have to be impartial, you understand.\nThe
    Facts: Two Timurid cities are at risk of being taken. The lack of reinforcements
    means that this could be an easy victory for Sibir, especially with Afghanistan
    to the south ready to feast on Timur’s misfortune. But with those long bowmen,
    it looks like we could be in for a very interesting fight."

    falls under his might. His fellow sailors cheer him on and demand a glorious speech
    to rouse their spirits. “My fellow men,” he begins as he stroke his long black
    mane, “the time has come for Pedro’s dream to be realized. No more will our empire
    be the joke of the world. No one will say that “South America is boring” or that
    “TPangolion didn’t need to show more slides”. No, my friends, as a great general
    once said, “When the sun rises and the east sets, then we shall make our move”!
    And I cans say that the east has definitely set!” (The author would now like to
    make it clear that he might be paraphrasing this speech, ever so slightly). The
    crowd roared, but a few sailors saw the Buccaneer’s angry fleet fast approach
    and wondered if Commander Lucas actually knew what he was talking about. \nMeanwhile,
    on the Argentina cruise, someone lost a bet.\nThe Facts: Brazil takes Cartagena
    while Mongolia declares peace with the Huns. Pedro’s attempt at taking Parana
    seems to have failed miserably, so it will be interesting to see if they can withstand

    On the southern plains outside of Nkuna, Shaka’s Impi engage with Nzinga’s forces. Rushing back from their war with the Ashanti, Nzinga claims that he will rain down a thousand years of suffering upon the Zulu for their betrayal. However, this historian believes Nzinga may have to back up claims. Though his fleet is much greater than Shaka’s, his forces need a couple of more cycles to Nkuna. It may be too late to save the city. But their reinforcements do look daunting, so time will tell if my anticipations are correct. As well, one might note the possibly intentional help the Boers are providing with open borders to the Zulu. Might this be an act to cause unrest in the region so they might snatch up the two powers after their con— Oh! I just received a message from Em! She’s such a wonderful girl, though a bit strong-headed. She gets it honestly from her mother— I’m guessing you are interested in her message? Well, it seems Stalin is plotting against Mao of the Chinese. Honestly, these barbarians seem to see conflict as their only source of communication. I will have to speak to the council about her discovery.
    The Facts: The Zulu’s forces have engaged with the Kongo outside Nkuna. It will be interesting to see who will come out the winner from this conflict. As well, Em discovers that Stalin is plotting against the Chinese, which is slightly surprising considering how away they are from that theatre.

    of hatred as the Champa has declared that Australia is a nefarious country – despite
    both of them fighting the same enemy. However, throughout Australia’s land, many
    see this as trivial. None find it more hilarious than the ocean colonies of the
    Atlantic, especially Bundaburg, which I hear is quite the resort destination for

    his ships get thrashed, he looks at the Argentina navy and begs for their assistance.
    He receives none as they continue to pass around the wins and losses from the
    betting round. Lucas is left wondering exactly what the purpose the east setting
    is before his ship is blown into oblivion. \nThe Facts: The Buccaneers retake
    Cartagena and destroy most of Pedro’s invasion fleet. To the south a few crossbowman
    march to take Parana, but with only three possible units, the invasion will surely
    fail. Meanwhile, because Blackfoot doesn’t have enough enemies, he denounces Afghanistan."

In the chaos, Osei II finds his mother dead on the battlements with an arrow through her heart. She speaks to him in her dying words, praying that she did right by him and his father. After a sob, she breathes her last in the boy’s arms. Enraged, he vows vengeance upon the Mali and orders his men to take to the offensive. Upon viewing this from my monitor, I will not be ashamed to say I wept in pain for the boy’s loss. How I wish things were different for him.
    Meanwhile, Nzinga of the Kongo seems unaffected by the Zulu’s southern invasion and decides to gamble on the city of Mampong. The limited amount of defense Morocco has will surely mean the city’s capture, but will the detour cost them Nkuna?

    Side by side, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and Haakon Haakonsson of Norway sip their beers and sunbathe in their parkas. Gustavus turns to Haakon and asks, “Wait, shouldn’t you be worried about Germany? You are at war with them, are you not?” Haakon laughs. “Germany? Bah! Hitler is busy enough with Israel. I will get to it eventually. In fact, I even declared war on Sparta too! But what about you? Aren’t you at war with Poland?” Adolphus can barely contain himself. “Poland? Bah! They are like insect under my foot. I am I the process of taking Gdansk right now from their puny hands!” They laugh and clink their beers. If I didn’t know any better, I would assume there is a tension between them. Perhaps one is planning the other’s downfall? But, of course, I am a scientist. I deal in facts, not hypotheticals.
    But, if this historian is allowed to assume, I think Norway will strike first.
    The Facts: Norway declares war on Sparta as Sweden attacks Poland’s northern city of Gdansk. These two Scandinavian countries look like two bros hanging out up there. It’s amazing they’ve continued to stay at peace. I can only wonder how long they’ll keep it up.

    In the expansive wastes (fine, fine, the minerals make it somewhat desirable) of mid-west Asia, Sibir continues to hammer against the Timurids’ door. While the world searches for new horizons in what is starting to be an age of reason (much to my excitement) this conflict is a spark of barbarianism. The populace Shahrisabz and Multan beg for the conflict to end, but Timur, their leader, only looks onward from the safety of his capital. He knows full well that the end of the war lies squarely in Kuchum Kahn’s hands. Unfortunately, with military advances like this, the mind forsakes peaceful reason and degrades into mindless slaughter. I have seen this all too well, for even Babylonians are not immune to such addiction.

While Haarkon continues to keep his secret peace with Hitler, Gustavus fights from pride and honour. “Oh, Haarkon will have to buy me drinks after I take Gdansk!” he declares as he slices through Polish soldiers. “Maybe he’ll have Berlin in his hands by the time he gets back! I would give anything to see that!” It is important to see how ignorant some countries are to the affairs around them. For if Gustavus knew what Norway’s leader had done just a cycle prior, he might be singing to a different tune.
    Or he would be still happily slicing the Polish. You can never tell with Scandinavians.
    The Facts: Gdansk still holds strong against Swedish forces, but with forces dwindling and no reinforcements in sight, I doubt that the Polish will be able to hold their most isolated city.

    The Facts: The Japanese are really hammering the Inuit currently with their Galleons!

I finally realize why the sun must rise.” Weak from exhaustion, but driving himself forward, Osei II picks up his sword and rallies his remaining forces together. “They will not take our lands,” he tell them as he passes. “The east will not set while I still breathe!”

  narration: |-
    Alvaro de Bazam, decorated admiral of the Second Australian Fleet, dissects his apple while one of his scouts reports on Jose’s moments. “The Philippine navy has lost Olongapo to the Champa!” he says with enthusiasm. “Their defenses are down and their fleets are disorganized. What are our orders?” Picking a slice off with his knife, Alvaro inspects it curiously. Then he slips the piece into his mouth and chews on it thoughtfully.
    “We strike while the iron is hot, my lad. First Baguio, then Manila!”
    The Facts: Look at that army! The full might of Australia’s navy is in full view here and it is clear that the Philippines are in serious trouble if they have to face those ships. As well, the Champa have taken the city of Olongapo and it looks like Baguio is next. It is the beginning of the end for Jose Rizal it seems! Also important is that the Sioux and Mexico are now at war!

    Shouts of success ride across the waves off the coast of Kwadukuza as the Zulu fleet sinks Kongo’s defensive armada. Shaka beat his chest and screams his war cry as his Impi burst into battle near Nkuna. Despite a decent army to the north, Nzinga Mbande is caught completely off guard as the bloodthirsty Zulu charge with newfound determination. From the looks of their ferocity, it looks like the Zulu may be entering into a military rebirth. If I was in Africa, I would be sacred of them.
    The Facts: The fighting is turning in the Zulu’s favour. It will be interesting to see if this advantage lasts. The sleeping giant of Yakutia also manages to sneak a denouncement out towards Germany, who quite honestly is the Blackfoot of Europe.

  narration: "Leonidas saw her on the shores of Antium. He had marched day and night
    to reach his Southern Front and imagined every way he would slay the woman who
    challenged his empire. Now they stared at each other, face to face, as the battle
    raged. She grinned. “Ah, the little boy who misses his father appears.” “Ah, the
    vile temptress at last graces my presence,” he retorts. “Tired of hiding in the
    shadows and shooting poison from afar?” “Only if you are tired of pretending to
    be a man.” With a roar, Leonidas lashes out with his sword. He meets her spear
    and the two dance in the battle. Sparks rain as their bloody passion sings out
    with each swing. Sweat, fear, and excitement mix in the air to form an intoxicating
    concoction that I dare not drink from. At last, Leonidas the Younger sees his
    chance and tries to pierce her flesh. But Celerina is clever and she brings down
    her spear on his arm, slicing it open and forcing him to drop his sword. With
    a cry he falls to the ground, his body aching and bleeding. She stands above him,
    spear tip to his throat and whispers sensually, “Now. Kneel you dog and surrender.”
    Through clenched teeth and burning eyes, Leonidas screams, “Men, fall back!” \nCelerina
    smiles and brings herself down to his weakened form. “I won’t kill you now, little
    boy, for I want you to remember that it was a woman who bested you. No one else.”
    Celerina spits on him and leaves the battlefield victorious.\nThe Facts: Sparta
    has declared peace with both Carthage and China. Sparta looks to have lost the
    most out of this war as their southern armies are completely weakened from Carthage’s
    onslaught. Also very important is that Portugal continues to strike against Rome
    with their superior ships. It’s only a matter of time to see if they can actually
    succeed."

    From the passionate battles of the Mediterranean we find our history setting its eyes on the Sibir-Timurid conflict. Not a single city has been taken yet, but it looks like Sibir has the upper hand. Fear is the only emotion I can think that is running through Timur’s head as he huddles alone in his palace. He dare not go outside and awaits the fated messenger who will bring him the outcome. Though I would like to think otherwise, it is sometimes prudent to be honest in a history and say that I would find myself in his exact same position.
    The Facts: The Timurids’ two cities get even closer to being taken. The wait is agonizing! As well, Mongolia and Korea enter the denouncing game and jump on the bandwagon to write their crude charcoal letters against Germany.

    Standing on his ice-slick ship, the admiral of the Inuit navy waits patient for a time to strike against his Japanese enemy. Patient is in his eye and I wonder if he will ever go into the fray of battle. Perhaps he enjoys watching the Japanese throw themselves at him, or maybe he is truly afraid of the empire’s powerful ships. Either way, news quickly comes to him of their leader’s friendship with Morgan and through frost-bitten lips, he whispers a command: “We sail for Sikutsipmaik!”
    The Facts: The Inuit and Buccaneers are friends now, which clearly means that the Inuit are gonna be using Morgan’s rum to warm themselves up in their frozen home. It is interesting to see how much longer the Inuit will wait before sending their fleet towards the Japanese or even the Blackfoot. Surely they could take those two Blackfoot cities with the navy they have now?

    Falling back to Manila, Jose Rizal hears the sound of Australian Galleass cannons firing on his precious cities. Even though he is far away and in the care of his militia, the nightmares of battle haunt him and his inability to stir his men bring a chill to his heart. He sits in his palace, a blanket around his shoulder, and shiver even though the city is in the thralls of a heat wave. The smell of smoke and burning flesh sticks in his nose and the name of a single admiral echoes in his ears till sleep takes him.
    The name is Alvaro.
    The Facts: Though they briefly took back Butuan, it looks like the Philippine navy has all but been defeated. Now it seems to be a race to see who will capture what, with Australia leading the charge against Jose’s island cities and Champ setting their eye on Manila.

    Autizotl the Destroyer, general of Stalin, stared out across the fields of citadels. He had questioned their every placement in regards to Poland, but still Stalin had insisted. Now he felt the cold winds of war brewing and he thought of his wife and child. He didn’t want war, he never enjoyed the taking of life. But he knew that, just like the sun, war would always rise and set in cycles. He allowed himself to grin as she spoke, “When the sun rises and the east sets, then we shall make our move . . . What a silly way to look at it . . .”
    The Facts: Look at all those citadels. It’s a wonder if they will be used anytime soon. As well, Leonidas declares war on Armenia because he clearly hasn’t gotten tired of sending his men to the slaughter.

    The representative looked smaller than Meiji imagined. But he knew that staying on his good side meant an easier victory for his army. “I sign here, right?” he asked. The broad, stout man nodded. With a twist of his quill, Meiji signed the treaty and handed it back to the representative. “You know what this means, don’t you?” The other man didn’t respond. “It’s only a matter of time before my brothers will face you again on the battlefield. Don’t you find this fascinating?” The representative only began to whistle and left the chamber without a word. Sitting back in his chair, Meiji looked to his decorated ceiling and sighed. “Ruling the world . . . it’s such a burden sometimes.”
    The Facts: Japan and the Blackfoot have signed a peace treaty! With that complete, it looks like we know exactly what Meiji has his eye set on. He’s packed his parka folks and headed north!

    Outside his palace, the sounds of cheering and music fill the air. Meiji hers the flute against the wind and allows himself to bask in the soothing sounds. His body eases, his mind lets go, and he dreams of cherry blossoms against the crisp, white snow.
    The Facts: Japan has now entered the Renaissance era (and it’s about time too!). I feel like they’ve gotten there primarily through military technology, so it will be interesting to see what else they have to work through to get further in technology.

    After a brief invasion, the Sioux have turned against their aggressors. With vengeance in their heart, they march towards Mdewakantonwan and have begun their assault. The foolish Crowfoot only realizes now what a mistake attack Sitting Bull was and quickly tries to mend the situation with a letter.
    He receives a decorated Sioux spear jutting out of his messenger’s back.
    The Facts: The Sioux looked armed and ready to take on the Blackfoot! Whether or not they’ll succeed depends on their determination, but their army looks sizable and eager. As well, you can sort of see Mexican troops surrounding the southern Sioux cities. How much trouble Mexico has in for Sitting Bull, is yet to be seen!

  narration: "Wounded and tired, Leonidas the Younger is brought to Sparta and sits
    in his fortress. He pictures the fight over and over again in his head, and slams
    his fist into his throne at the thought of Celerina’s words. “I am not a child,”
    he mutters to himself, over and over again. “I am not a child!”\nOne of his minister
    sneaks into the room and Leonidas restrains himself from screaming at the poor
    man. “What do you want?” he asks with as much composure as he can muster. “My
    lord, it seems that Varna has repelled David’s invasion.” Leonidas barely twitches.
    “I thought you would be pleased with this my lord?” “I have a lot on my mind,”
    Leonidas retorts. Then, with a sudden realization, he lifts himself from his throne.
    “Varna’s invasion has been repelled . . . Yes . . . Yes! First I will conquer
    Armenia, then Israel, and finally, when I have killed all my enemies, I will meet
    Celerina on the battlefield one final time and end her life!” He tilt his head
    back and roared, “Yes! Leonidas the Younger is not a child anymore, nor is he
    stuck in his father’s shadow! After today, I will be known as a true leader: they
    will call me Leonidas the Conqueror!” \nThe Facts: Varna is safe and remains in

    another war, especially if this one is as costly as the last?"

    Meiji looks out from his balcony to see his capital stretching out. He reaches his hands out to the sun and breathes in the cool air. Tomorrow is a new dawn for his empire, one that he plans to shake the very foundations of this world. With a heavy sigh and determination for the future, Meiji closes his eyes and ponders the world. “When the sun rises and the east sets, then we shall make our move. Yes, I know this idea well. For the Empire of the Sun has begun to rise, indeed. And those who oppress us will be left in the cold, barren wastes of death. Yes, the sun has finally come out from the shadows of this world and it is hungry for power!”
    As I have mentioned previously, it is important for a historian to view the events shown to him/her with the utmost care and consideration. But when considering Meiji and his new empire, this history can only wonder how far he will go for the satisfaction he craves. Maybe this world will not be enough for his ambition and that thought truly scares me.
    However, I would also be lying if I said it doesn’t excite me either.
    The Facts: The Inuit and Japanese have begun to fight and it is only a matter of time before we see a clear victor here. But until then, it is exciting to wonder how important this war will be in the future for these two passionate empires.

    And with that, part seventeen is now over! I would like to thank TPangolin for allowing me to play with this idea I had and for you, the reader, for getting through it all. This document came to over 11,000 words and I hope you‘ve enjoyed a more narrative focused experience from a character within the Battle Royale world. If you like what you‘ve read here, I will be publishing a series of pulp novels surrounding Em‘s exploits soon so look out for them! Yes, Makru does show up in them. No, I‘m not spoiling how.
    Again, thank you very much for reading and remember to subscribe to the subreddit if you haven‘t already. This has been Aeternix saying, 'Goodnight and may your new civilization‘s overlords be kind!'
