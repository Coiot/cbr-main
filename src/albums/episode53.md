  narration: "<p>Hey everyone, LunarNeedle here! This is a special part, and by special I mean narrated, recorded and culled entirely by myself. This doesn’t come without any downsides, such as half-way through having hex grid on, having to skip multiple uninteresting turns. Tons of headaches I had to learn and adapt on the fly but...This part will be massive; and the violence will be intense! I’ve been given a good amount of time to narrate this so expect the audio to be an hour long.Let me know how a more narrative focused perspective-driven Royale suits you. And Dawkinzz, I am sorry. :(</p>"

  narration: "<p>Deep in the cyber sub, underneath the viewing arena was a bar with one solitary human swiping left and right on his holographic display. You didn’t know his name, but you knew your purpose. He was the narrator for the next episode: a selected few allowed to tell the narrative and perspective on this slice of the cylinder's history. As you made your way into the bar he spun you a seat, looking over to an image on the holotape with an amusing grin.“You finally made it, huh? Sit down and look at this. It’s amazing how perspectives can change, isn’t it? That last peace deal was heartbreaking for those who put support behind Hiawatha. They went from zero to hero and back to zero. Hah...”The man took a sharp drink of a yellow beverage, reacting in shock to the high alcoholic content before taking another long drink. You got yourself a seat next to him, looking towards the holotape with interest.</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Before we start, let’s get on the same page. Look. This is the map that the people know. Notice the large Kazakh holdings in America and the surprisingly split territory between the Moors and Zimbabwe, with obviously the Moors having a tactical edge. Also, look at the land Uruguay has. It might be 70% water, but Lavalleja has control over at least two continents with the capacity to project north and west. This is a powder keg waiting to erupt. However, we all know the real winners right now.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>“The battles in North America are fighting through ashes and soot. All cities north of the Yucatan to the Iroquois core are most likely abandoned wastelands. Cities here are trying to survive using nanotechnology and underground farms. The only standing structures in these cities are the large flagpoles with bullet-riddled flags. Hiawatha and Lavalleja are most likely facing riots in their core, and the demand of a regime change might be the only thing fueling these powers to grind and grind away.”</p>"

The message of letting a rival Civilization own from the tip of South America up to former Haitian lands must be insulting. They were once the lands Lavalleja took pride in yanking away from Haiti even when the Kuikuro stood against all oppressors. If I’m a betting man, which I am, the war in America is likely the only reason someone hasn’t taken an attempt to assassinate the Uruguayan supreme leader.”</p>"

No, not acid rain, but hover tanks raising up and down in a show of force against the country of Zimbabwe that was forced to sign an open borders treaty. Yes, even in a world this messed up, shows of force and bravado are still important. I imagine Mutota’s political future must be on the edge. Everyone not Kazakhs must be having a difficult political life… </p>"

Sure, having two natural wonders is kinda nice, but those tiles are weaker than most Future Era improvements. Let it go, Hiawatha. No one wants to live there after the stuff you and Lavalleja did to it. I somehow knew these two kids would be the final two in the Americas. They never got along. It seems that even childhood rivalries can play on the big screen.”</p>"

I wonder if Uruguay is just willingly playing with its food. Damn, childish rivalries die hard, don’t they?” “Speaking of rivalries. The Carribean Moorish and American Kazakh cities in this show have more population than any non-core city in this scene.

Moors are just as well defended, and this large air force will have limited impact in the emptier Uruguayan core. The only thing they could probably take is a few coastal cities and Madagascar proper, but even that feels like it’ll just spell the end of Mutota. I expect, honestly, that Moors and Kazakh will divide Zimbabwe’s holdings. Such is the life of a regional power against mega-empires, I suppose…”</p>"

Maybe he could pull out of America until he’s willing to invest actual resources. The Uruguayan city of Cumania and Carmelo is proof that even Uruguay considers the advantages of a modern air force. I wonder if they even have the resources to manifest a large army.”“Fun fact: did you know that this world was made abundant with resources? For every capital from pre-endgame  was given a plentiful amount of every strategic resource. Either way, they’ve got tons of it and their core still looks THIS empty, especially compared to the big three across the ocean. Anyways, I’m rambling on.

An airforce is the key. Look at how much the Moors have. Meanwhile, aside from the vulnerable city of Snåase, not many units cross into the self-imposed demilitarized zone… Wait a moment...”“I knew a time like this would come, but I wasn’t expecting it to be now. The AI, in its wisdom, has learned how to use its air force for something other than city-bombing. Indeed, men in city-dwarfing hover-tanks are the new target for the airpower of the Moors.

But all is not too painful, as all cities here only flipped once. The Moors will not feel such a loss as to commit a navy to this war at all. The morale gain for Uruguayan troops, however, must be felt. I wonder if they’ll actually carpet up before it’s too late. Hah.”</p>"

There’s not much in the way of an air force to mess with, so this is a pure battle.

It’s honestly as classic as the Civilization Battle Royale. Madagascar seems to be enjoying their new ally in the Kazakhs, although their outdated display units are blocking a lot of areas on their core. With Total War happening soon, this won’t be an issue anymore.”His face scowled, glancing over to you before taking a long drink. You both shared a moment of silence before he pressed on, “Oh, you didn’t know. Primarch Lime warned me when giving me the episode, that due to production constraints that Total War is being called. One is happening on turn 1200 actually; so yeah. Those units will disappear fast.”You couldn’t respond if you wanted to. The world was wrapped in war already.

That’s a shame, I was hoping that someone would’ve put the carpet bomber in place. Although, in the city of Mursiyyah, look at that. Sixteen suborbital bombers with high levels arrived, and they all seem ready to torch the remaining army.

So, by letting these cities get captured by the Kazakhs, they forced a choke point of the remaining Zimbabwean units. Unfortunately for them, this resulted in the loss of Palmyra and another city in Turkey. It seems likely that Zimbabwe might be able to capture cities in Moorish proper. Are they actually going to conquer them…? Impossible.”</p>"

Maybe I’m judging it all wrong. Look at that core and what’s missing. No units, but tons of civilians.

His smile was out and proud. Since you entered the empty bar, you’ve seen nothing but serious looks on his face. The man glances at you and immediately stiffens up, nervously rubbing his cheeks. “Oh, I got money on the Kazakhs winning it all. Sorry if it made me seem biased.

You can see thicker piles of units near Turkistan but… is that next to their capital? Could the Kazakhs lose their capital?”The narrator seemed bewildered, leaning back in the bar stool aimlessly as he looked to the ceiling, as if inspecting it for clues.

But, you could see from the units that aside from slipping Meroe, that they might lose from the western front collapsing. The narrator finally came to his senses, looking to the screen before smiling a wicked grin.“You know, kid, while the Kazakhs winning is ideal, I’ll be honest. I just want to see the world end. Haven’t you heard the news? The leaders are already preparing for their trip on the cylinder. A new world is approaching. I don’t care if the Moors win, or if the Kazakhs win. I have much, much more important duties in the future.”The silence filled the air as the narrator with a crazed tired expression took an aggressive shot of what seemed to be whisky with Kazakh script on the bottle.

  narration: "<p> “I could’ve sworn I saw this exact same image moments ago. The Kazakhs seemed to resummon its army to take the Iroquois core, but peaced out by the time the army could actually take something. Remember, due to the nature of the Kazakhs’ American holdings, they have to fight from two directions and in the range of many core Iroquois cities. They might all evaporate into nothing... or we could see the Iroquois lose their capital. My money is on the Kazakhs losing the continent, though.”</p>"

Perhaps they were hoping the constant flipping of Las Piedras could result in the city being razed and for their settler to float in to settle a city. It’s a bold move, but unfortunately this Total War thing is not optional. I doubt any of these cityless units would survive more than one or two turns. It’s sad; but we might have to give a soft F for many empires soon.”</p>"

A Qin knight offers his advice on how to position themselves. In more serious news, the army buildup actually seems to be on the Kazakhs’ advantage. In the deep North, there’s little units. Meanwhile, the Baltics seems to be carpeted by the defense-focused Nanohive units around Snaase, and all south seems to be in favor of Moors. Wait, I think there’s a scene for that…”</p>"

The Moors are just going to send a shock troop of units to capture a swath of Zimbabwean cities, lose their army, rebuild a new one in their capital and repeat until Zimbabwe is dead. Add in the very powerful air support from Mursiyyah and Eko and there’s not many chances that Zimbabwe can win. This is likely a wash for Mutota unless they get all of their cities to produce hovertanks to slow them down, or rely on the aforementioned Nanohive unit. They should just defend and hope that the Moors runs out of units and collapse to the Kazakhs horde.”</p><p></p><p>“...What? Prediction games are serious business in the group I’m in.

Meanwhile, Moorish soldiers begin to push closer and closer to the border, although losses near… oh, lord, I am not pronouncing those cities.” he loosely gestured upwards to the Scandinavian cities, clearing his throat. “Losses near these cities are particularly light due to bombing from nearby in Aarborte.” He seemed excited, like a bloodrush of ecstacy filling his eyes. His speaking was more fevered and seemed to be beaming with excitement. One thing crossed your mind as he went to the next page. That was likely the last time you’d see the great Qin knight.

Credits given to the Iroquois for the defense; I truly do not know how they did that.”The narrator slumped back into the light, giving you a long moment to look at him. He had slicked back, ruffled hair and a pronounced forehead. He had a medal on his chest, but it was in a script that wasn’t taught in the sub.

This will become useful when attempting to capture heavily-defended city of Pokhara and former Nepal capital, Kathmandu. Honestly, I see no opposition with this. If they can hold back the Moors, they can split Zimbabwe. Perhaps then they could finally muster up more than ten planes. Oh, what am I saying; they’d rather build more Hovertanks.”</p>"

The Kazakhs are likely to capture all of Indonesia before finally slowing down and focusing all the effort on Zimbabwe proper.
