  narration: Hello and welcome to all! It is time for your dose of drug that is made
    from concentration of the deaths of hundreds of millions of digital citizens in
    a war-torn hell that is Civ BR! My name is /u/GloriousBeachead, and I will be
    your guide to the exciting bloodshed of part 37.

  narration: |-
    As we can see on the lovingly crafted map of /u/LasciraxAriscal, arctic powers are at ascendancy here. Sibirs have chomped down couple more USSR cities, Yakutia grabs the rare and delicious Japan clay and Inuits take three Canadian ones and Sweden has mostly assimilated Norway.
    Winter is not coming anymore, its already -40 celsius and snow is piling as high as russian corpses on the steppes. Hellish blizzards roar down from the polar north and batter planes over Hudson Bay. Viking Gods are looking at the destruction of Norway and prepare for Ragnarök. Iceland can soon send their trade caravans over ice to greenland wiht some really unhappy camels. In Finland, Kekkonen looks at the thermometer and postpones the military exercises until its really cold.

  narration: This map by /u/AlbinosRideDinos show which civs are on the proverbial
    struggle street (or in Indonesia‘s case - the Struggle Straits). The Boers are
    still holding the number one spot, despite huge Sibir gains in the north. But
    the grace of Power Rankers is notoriously fickle, and if they continue doing nothing,
    it might be that the sibirs will get their moment in the spotlight soon. We shall
    see will things change after this part!

  narration: |-
    Here we can observe the remains of USSR. That they are still alive, is a testament to the ferocious Soviet defence. In the epic struggle against the Sibir they lost a whopping 14 cities. This immensely brutal war lasted 73 turns and one can only guess how many units went down in the crucible of war.
    Sibirian air force is looking strong here, 12 planes altogether. Main Sibir horde seems to be moving back to east, not that they lack manpower. According to the InfoAddict charts Sibirs have doubled their military manpower in the last 23 turns, from 48226 to 903080. That is just crazy, especially when you consider in that time they obliterated Timurids and fought a really brutal no-quarter war with Stalin. Sibirs are looking downright monstrously scary here.

  narration: |-
    The thin white line that is Portugal regains Flipsbon from the pirate horde. On the other side of Portugal it is finally looking possible that Rome will once again be spartan. Leonidas has now a cannon and musketmen next to the city in the red. Truly, Maria the Mad can now surpass even Nero in her madness and fiddle as both of her capitals burn.
    If Portugal and Bucs don‘t make peace soon I don’t see Maria holding Lisbon. Bucs don’t have much in the way of land force here, but they have more than enough corsairs to keep capturing Lisbon, and Maria does not have much troops either. Portugalians can only hope that buccaneers lose interest. After this much flipping, Lisbon booty is probably quite tested and boring after all.

  narration: |-
    For the undoubted excitement of all Indonesia fans in the sub, Indonesia is finally doing glorious things in the spotlight of the world. That’s a pro, but the con is that the glorious thing looks like a ferocious last stand against the Kimberley. I count 23 kimberlian air planes in this slide, and their carpet bombing has already taken Surabaya to the red and Batam to the yellow. A thin turquoise line of privateers and caravels is bravely trying to hold Jandamarra back, but it’s a miracle if they don‘t lose their closest cities. Maybe they can outmaneuver kimberlians in the narrow straits of their islands where the kimberlian (that‘s a word right TPang?) numbers don’t count that much? Personally, I fear that Nutmeg is going to crack and it’s going to crack hard.
    TPang‘s note: Sure, why not?

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part37-scene08.jpg
  narration: Biggest winner of the Indonesia – Kimberley war is Burma anyway, which
    makes immediate peace with Gajah Mada. Burma is a unhailed turtle hero of Southeast
    Asia, really. They have been at war with almost all, if not all of their neighbours,
    often times with many at the same time. They are undoubtedly the least powerful
    nation in their corner. Still they cling to the life with canny defending, using
    their geographical advantages and island citadels. Anawrahta is clearly not going
    gentle in to that good night. Godspeed, you magnificent stubborn bastard!

  narration: Burmese are also really happy to assist the other turtle powers of the
    area. Here we can observe them taking a page from the Hawaiian playbook and deploying
    a sizeable peacekeeping force to protect Dalai Lama and his monks in Lhasa. Conquering
    Lhasa seems to get harder and harder every turn.

  narration: |-
    Swedish army is making a concentrated push on Sparta, predictably with Finnish (IRL) Hakkapeliittas in the vanguard of the invasion, doing all the hard work for their Swedish paymasters. There is a old German saying about hakkapeliittas: ”Lets rape it first, said Finn when slaughtering a pig”.  Lodz is going to fall, no question. Looks like Leonidas is planning to hold the line at Cumae-Corinth Citadel spam chain. Holding the line against superior foes is of course a spartan specialty, but Persians did not have a air force, unlike Sweden. It helps that Leonidas has finally gotten rifles for his hoplites. FIX THE BAYONETS, OOO-RAH!

  narration: |-
    Arabia might have started the war, but it is Israel that is on the offensive. Judging by the empty but pillaged citadels, Jewish suicide commandoes have crushed the Arabian defence lines. Bethlehem or death, goes the war cry. I think it is pretty fitting that it’s David who is fighting riflemen with crossbows. Very old testament-y.
    On the northern operational theater, Hebron is in the yellow and circled with cannon batteries. With numerous melee units on the range, God’s chosen people need a miracle. If the game glitches cause TPang is trying to put the future time mod in, it is divine intervention. I am not a narrator, I am a prophet.

  narration: |-
    Seems like Inuit found the closet that leads to Sarnia and welded the door shut with frigates. Also Oohenupa falls back to the might of the Inuit. It is brutal and tight fighting in narrow straits here, with ship decks painted red with slick and freezing gore as three navies tear into each other at the arctic wastes. Inuit air forces are targeting the Maple syrup factories to demolish Canadian morale and there are rumours that Pearson is secretly developing a modern igloo-buster bomb. Icelandic navy seems to have taken considerable losses and pulled a bit back, but Inuits should not underestimate just how many ships Iceland can throw to block the white walkers.
    What should be worrisome to the allied forces, is that while Icelandic and Canadian military manpower is diminishing, Inuit curve is sharply rising, despite their relatively bad production.

  narration: 'Lodz falls to Sweden, not surprisingly. Spartans are hastily organizing
    their defence in the south, which looks a bit bad considering that their core
    looks quite empty of reserves. Especially compared to the horde of Swedish riflemen
    which is marching onwards from northern ex-reich. On the paper, the two sides
    are actually quite close: Sweden has third as much military manpower, but they
    are on the offensive which is harder than defending. In production they are almost
    neck in neck. The big plus for the Swedish is their budding air force, but Spartan
    positions look very defendable. I predict Lodz will be the only city to flip here.'

  narration: |-
    United States of Albany is crumbling under the spurred cowboy boot of Sam Houston. Texas looked like stagnated and technologically backwards for so long, and now there is suddenly great war infantry at the front lines. I am afraid that this is it for Lincoln. There just is no room for emancipation in this fascist world of eternal warfare. I don’t know what could be more symbolical for Battle Royale that this is a world where Statue of Liberty will never be built.
    Best hope for Honest Abe is that there are some Hawaiian units loitering around. Seems like Kamehameha has decided once again to deploy peacekeepers to American continent. He just has a Mexico-sized problem in getting more of them in position.

  narration: A parting Fuck You gift from leaving Sibir horde. Now Stalin can enjoy
    his morning vodka at the balcony of Kremlin, gazing in to a Sibirian citadel-gulag
    and wondering where did it all go so wrong.
- scene_number: "16"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part37-scene16.jpg
  narration: |-
    There are only five Indonesian ships in this slide. Forget that defensive naval warfare on the indonesian straits. A brave great general is floating in the middle of Kimberley naval taskforce, daring them to taste his luxuriously spicy food. Kimberlians clearly like the idea so much that they conquer Batam, diving into their hoard of cloves, nutmeg and peppers.
    Kimberley will be slowed by the fact that there is simply no free tile in Indonesian islands. All are reserved by the brave turquoise soldiers. Establishing glorious beachhead will be hard, as I well know.

  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part37-scene17.jpg
  narration: |-
    /u/SirMallock has explained this slide better than I ever could:
     ”We all know Carthage has had their fantastically 'human-like' AI, correct? Well, in the last two parts... it hasn‘t been that way. They have failed to do more than dent the Ayyubid cities. Then, they declared war on Morocco with almost no army to fight them. 'Why is this?', you may ask. I know. This all started when /u/ProletariatCossack, a famed Carthage supporter, left. Obviously, he was the cause of Hannibal‘s successes. He controlled the civ. He was secretly the leader of Carthage. When he left, the AI took back control, and now can‘t do anything correctly”.
    It sure would explain why the ”defending” Moroccoan forces are rampaging through the northern Sahara. Morocco does not have much in the way of siege, but I think berber cavalry with their +50% combat bonus in desert will prove adequate in assailing Tangier. Is this the return of Ahmad Al-Manslaughter? He enhances his bloodthirsty reputation by dowing Armenia.
    Also there is a pirate backdoor squad navigating around the Gibraltar, no doubt on their way to haul some keel at Goa.

  narration: Good news for USA, finally! They no longer have to feat that cheap Chinese
    products will push all the ’murican products off from the market, because no one
    can trade with USA anymore. Now embargoed, Lincoln will make America great again!
    Though against the international agreement, Texas forces are still exporting hot
    lead and cannonballs in to USA. As we saw with the recent happenings in Oregon
    IRL, real cowboys don’t respect the laws and sure as hell don’t appreciate the
    federal USA.

  narration: |-
    Not surprisingly, Order will not become a world ideology. We shall see if this voting will be enough to trigger wars agains USSR or Afghanistan from autocratic world powers irritated by their proposition. Inuits have deployed the White walker army to Sihasapa, courtesy to Blackhearts who gleefully assist the Inuits with open borders against their hated enemy, Canada. Native bros before canuck hoes!
    Major Canadian air force base of Victoria is on the yellow, with battleships and and at least one privateer closing on target. If I was Pearson, I would evacuate those planes post haste. There is no way he is going to hold that miserable, frozen hellscape that vaguely resembles a icy island city.

  narration: |-
    Arabian counterattack has driven the Israelites back to their own holy land, mostly. David has noticed that his sling trick just does not quite work with crossbow against other ranged weapons and has wisely upgraded into muskets. Hebron is still hanging in there, not quite Heb-gone yet.
    The other semi-medieval power of the area, Ayyubids, are doing a sterling job defending against Carthage. Despite ten green cannons in the picture, not a single yellow city has taken any damage at all. Truly Carthago is just not the same without Cossack.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part37-scene21.jpg
  narration: Machu seems to be now pretty firmly in the argentinian hands. A major
    slap in the face of Brazil, truly. They spend literally thousands of years trying
    to take a Incan city, and Argies manage to conquer one in couple of turns. There
    is also an Argentinian backdoor squad trying to butcher their way to Cusco. Only
    a almost-dead musketman stands in their way. Incan defence has truly been just
    stellar for 36 parts, but is this the end? Chilean navy is also looking for openings
    on the coastline, but with just couple of ships it looks uncertain if they can
    even take an Incan city, not even speaking of holding one.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part37-scene22.jpg
  narration: Oh boy. Here we go again, Stalin just hates those Armenians. It looks
    like just a comfort-war here, something for Joe to vent his anger to. Without
    navy and land borders, Stalin can just feed his troops to the waves of the Black
    sea. Knowing Stalin, it certainly looks like a probable course of action. Just
    fuck those Bourgeoise riflemen. Though who knows, Tigranocerta is completely undefended.

  narration: Aboriginal voracious appetite for spices knows no bounds! Surabaya falls
    under the ravening hordes of Kimberley who are so done with bland-tasting kangaroo
    meat. Also need some spices to cover the fact that crocodile tastes exactly like
    chicken. In their haste to acquire more spice islands, they have let the five-ship
    navy of Indonesia to live, and also that great general is still swimming in the
    sea. Say one thing about Jandamarra, say that he is a merciful war leader. That
    still wont stop him from taking Jakarta, which has now entered the danger zone.

  narration: Boers are pretty far away from Swedish Ikeas yet, so they need to acquire
    their sofas from nearby. Luckily the worlds biggest sofa maker lives just next
    door! Indeed, agent Semiramis has seen Kruger filling the gasoline tanks of his
    land ships. He is clearly planning to go into a shopping spree.

  narration: |-
    Texas will have none of that ”emancipatin’ the slaves” bullshit! Albany falls in flames, as Elvis plays on in his artillery encampment. Looks like Mao will outlive Lincoln, who would have believed? There is still Cincinnati left, with Hawaii peacekeepers rushing to cover it from the oncoming storm. Looks very shaky for Lincoln anyway.
    But just look at Texas, look at it go! Houston proves that he has more guts that you can hang from the fences. For so long we have been banking from him to go down in flames in the hands of Mexico or Bucs, and here he is, showing to y’all what he reckons about your empty opinions.

  narration: Mao has heard that his good communist buddy Stalin has some problems
    with Armenia and decides to lend his helping hand. The immortal God-Chairman of
    Maokind has shown that he has absolutely zero problems defending against one of
    the largest armies of the world with only couple of Half-dead Maos. Just give
    him some time to rest and he will start the long march back to the top, now that
    he is about balance handicapped.

  narration: It is a communist plot against Armenia! Also the glorious People’s Graveyard
    of the Empires of Afghanistan decides to help his best and only buddy, Joe Stalin
    in his quest to eradicate the Armenian beast! He can maybe even reach Bukhara
    with planes! Afghanistan is in an interesting position here. Their choice of Ideology
    will certainly bite them in the ass before or later, but they are sorta doing
    okay at the moment. They are perhaps the only nation in the area that can be expected
    to be able to fight against Sibirs and not lose horribly, thanks to their sizeable
    air force and mountain passes. On the other side, there are some Muggles. It would
    certainly not be impossible for Mirwais Hotak to Avada Kedavra them to the club
    loser. It is certainly the only direction that leads Afghanistan back to top.

  narration: Indonesian navy has apparently mated and produced offspring. New ships
    come straight outta nowhere and take back Surabaya! Lack of frigates on Indonesian
    side probably means that they lack iron, except in the backbone of that great
    general who is poised to take Batam back all by himself.

  narration: RIP Indonesian great general turns 385-386. You were gone too soon. Kimberlian
    air forces take Surabaya down to zero, but there is still a lot of stuff floating
    in front of it, preventing immediate capture. There is even a Champan peacekeeping
    trireme and composite bowmen. Same can’t be said about Medan, which is in the
    red and has two privateers hanging there, preparing for the looting.

  narration: |-
    I’m not certain what has damaged those Moroccoan ships, but it’s probably Kimberlian ships because they are the only ones with damage in this screen? Without war room, I am no good with these so-called ”irrelevant” wars. If those Moroccoan ships are heading to Wulungarra though, it’s not going to end well. City has 86 defence, that’s way too much.
    Boer navy watches patiently like a wolf. They have a high amount of caravels still, but it is a good screen for those destroyers and aircraft carriers.

  narration: Hebron falls! God has not delivered! Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? Atheists
    – Jews 1-0. Now the road to the holy city of Jerusalem lies straight open, and
    Armenia is clearly not done yet. It remains to be seen though can they take Jerusalem?
    They have cannons, true, but Israel mini-carpet of crossbowmen stings surprisingly
    much. Armenia has riflemen though, so if they get into melee range of those xbows,
    they are done. Pikes high, sons of Abraham!

  narration: |-
    Kiyaksa flips between Canada and Inuits. Meanwhile, Canadian counteroffensive heads towards Sarnia by land. That is really a respectable amount of artillery, perhaps enough to keep Hudson bay clear of enemy ships. For now, inuits have naval dominance, while Canada rules in land, but that is going to change when those Inuit infantrymen secure the glorious beachhead on the frozen shores.
    Victoria is now on the red and is sure to fall to those Inuit ships, eliminating a fairly large chunk of Canadian air forces. It does not look good for Canada, really.
    In front of Akureyri, three icelandic ships are holding off a single Inuit ironclad. Seems like white walkers are concentrating on Canada for now.

  narration: Meanwhile in the old world, Rome just wont fall to Spartans. Honestly
    though, Leonidas has currently much bigger problems in the form of Swedish menace
    that is advancing southwards. Have to say Spartan defence looks downright chaotic.
    Seems like 300 men are the most Leonidas can handle to command. He has currently
    five citadels in the front, and all are unoccupied. Is this a trap? I need to
    consult my buddy, Admiral Ackbar.

  narration: Hawaii makes peace with Trigger Darkhan, ending an potentially great
    rap feud before it even began really. Aloha navy rules supreme in these parts
    of Pacific, but they might have underestimated just how many Gatling guns the
    Mexicans can float to block them. There is no doubt that Merida and Waipahu are
    going full Bilma-Morelia now. It’s an epic game of flipper with hundreds of thousands
    if not millions of casualties.

  narration: Surabaya is still barely hanging there, but Medan has fallen. Indonesian
    privateers seem to have successfully captured a now sorely anemic frigate from
    Kimberley. That’s not much of a consolidation, because Kimberley has now secured
    a glorious beachhead almost next to Surabaya. If Kimberley can dig their superior
    land forces in, there is no rooting them out. The amount of Kimberlian ships and
    troops trickling in to the war zone is steadily increasing slide by slide. The
    pincers to crack the nutmeg are slowly closing.

    Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to please prepare to take your hats off. This looks like the last shot of independent USA. Hawaii peacekeeping force is too little too late.
    Judging by the hp of Albany, some brave and lonely ’murican units have done a suicide charge, desperately flying the American flag. That, or Lincoln has ordered artillery fire out of spite.

  narration: |-
    Two uppity colonies make peace. This war was probably originally started because Australia lost in cricket or something like that. Not a single shot was probably fired in it, but probably there has been lots of rude telegrams being sent.
    Kimberley core is empty and silent like a dream time. Same can’t be said of Australia, with a terrible, terrible carpet of troops waiting. Australia has been silent for a long time now, only waging a pretty difficult war against Korea. And I know the reason, because there are _two_ prime ministers in this picture. Australia is clearly in a constitutional crisis if not in a outright civil war! No wonder their decision-making is frozen.

  narration: Our trio of agents are traveling again, with agent Em clearly getting
    the best city by far. I think /u/TPangolin is favoring his secret lover. No doubt
    that’s the reason behind those atrociously inaccurate predictions, morale in the
    secret service must be at all-time low because of corruption in the agency.

    Anemic frigate has gone to purchase some snacks from SpongeBob, but Indonesia has new frigates. Maybe they are now trading for it, or I was mistaken about their lack of iron.
    Speaking of resources, that must be uranium that I glimpse under the trading post next to Medan. Nukes are not that far off and every bit counts.
    Surabaya falls, Medan flips back and forth and Samarinda seems to be next. And then there is the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. The only question really here is just where will Jandamarra stop, and will the resulting warmongering penalty trigger Australia?

    Carthage still has not managed to field a believable defence of Tangier, which looks sure to fall. Lack of siege is clearly slowing Ahmad Al-Manslaughter down, but I guess those crossbowmen are better than nothing.
    In the Mediterranean, we can see that the buccaneer backdoor squad has utterly failed. Or has it? Because at least cap’n Morgan has Lisbon now firmly in his rum-soaked bootylicious hands. With pirate great war infantry landing to Iberian peninsula left and right, it looks like Lisbon is gone for good. And in the next wave there are cannons. I fear for Porto.

    Portugese navy, she prepares for her last stand… But she is in the Cartagenan
    waters where Portuguese clearly can’t follow. Well played, Anne.

    A Chinese and a Mongolian great general are engaged in a staring contest against each other over the border line. My money is on the Mongolian guy, simply because his name means Eternal Iron. Can’t lose with a name like that.
    Mao has amassed a army of three crossbows, two knights and a worker. If I was Vietnam or Mongolia, I would be very afraid. General Eternal Iron might stare like a champion, but he is no match for Iron Mao.

  narration: |-
    Canadian field artillery pounds now night and day, endless rain of steel falling in to the frozen wastelands. Guns of Hudson Bay never sleep. Too bad that Inuits are now coming also from the west, striking into Saint John through Blackheart lands. There is a hastily assembled defence force there too, but with Saint John on the red (and low on hp) it looks bad. A column of Inuit infantrymen are hastily paddling through the Hudson bay, trying to land behind Canadian lines.
    There is by the way no less than three sources of uranium visible on the Canadian side of the border. Pearson must not allow his northern dominions to fall, lest the Inuits get their hands of ample supply of nukes.

  narration: And just like that, Saint John is gone and the Western Canadian Maple
    Leaf Army is driven to Regina. Here we can also see Sihasapa which has been Inuit
    already for some time, I believe. Kiyaksa and Victoria have zero hp, and if they
    break, Canada loses a third of their air forces and uranium. That infantry against
    riflemen is just brutally uneven. We can also see that inuits are shipping AA-guns
    to the frontlines. That is surely going to hurt.

  narration: Trigger drops the mic and citadels on Korea, almost encapsulating Pyongyang.
    There are already two more Yakutian special great generals on the way to steal

    trigger finger is itching.

  narration: Hannibal has redirected his assault straight in to the Cairo, shooting
    cannonballs into the home city of the party pope. Except, only in his dreams cause
    he does not have siege on range. I doubt that brute force melee tactic is going
    to carry the day here. Carthage looks really spent, and with Morocco threatening
    his western holdings, peace could be eminently beneficial here.

    Instead of making peace, he hates on the other green-colored nation in earth. Also green-colored Brazil dows Mughals. Whats the deal, is that Mughal-green somehow wrong hued?
    Here we can see that Afghanistan controls all the uranium in the Indian sub-continent. Good for them, it might be that nukes are what they need if Sibirs come a-knockin’.

    this Battle Royale! Maori fleet looks pretty alright technologically, but there
    is a lot of unupgraded caravels there. Also no ironclads, I guess they don‘t have
    coal in there. What they do have, though, is a pretty good air force. No match
    for Australia, but it would still be a epic war.

    has pretty good navy. It’s not amazing as his 100+ trireme navy was just a couple
    of parts ago, but certainly its better now. Their land forces are quite okay too,
    relatively speaking. If they really would try, they could take and hold Mughals,
    but something is keeping them at bay. Maybe they fear Afghanistan so much.

    Ladies and gentelemen, may I ask you to take your hats off, bow down your heads and have a minute of silence for United States of America. We are not here to only witness the passing of a great nation and a truly iconic leader. We are not here to only witness the end of a truly massive source of memes and OC. We are here to witness the death of a dream.
    People of America had a dream, a dream of a United Nation where people would be their own führers instead of bowing under the fascist iron boots of Autocracy or under the tyranny of stifling and forced fake equality of Order.
    That dream was called the Freedom, but alas, it was more Free-DOOM. Never again will there be a possibility for man to enjoy the fruits of his labor, or do whatever he may please. A great statue of turquoise lady will never show her light now to the dark, atlantic ocean.
    For the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free, there is now only a concentration camp or a gulag where to march.
    Press F once for ’Murica, and twice for the death of a better world.

    Oceania-Southeast Asia Mayhem picks up steam with Vietnam deciding that Champa must be showed who are the top dragons here. Vietnam has actually no less than three aircraft carriers in this slide, but they are empty so, well. Nice. On the sea the two combatants look more or less equal, but on the land Victor Charlie has a crushing superiority. The only problem for Trungs is that neither their UU Viet Cong or their massive horde of cannons can capture cities. They need to get privateers on range, but Champan sea wall looks pretty daunting. We shall see.
    Amongst the other nations to gun for Champa is Hawaii. They might actually have a decent shot at sniping or capturing champan cities. We just dont know how much of Aloha navy there is left after the carnageation at California.

  narration: Yeah, looks like Hawaii is Hawa-bye here. They leave the butchered remains
    of probably millions of civilians behind and head towards champan lands. Though
    Mexico has won a city here, it is a textbook example of a truly disastrous pyrrhic
    victory. Hawaii has sunken so many gatling guns under the waves, that mermaids
    and fishes are dying en masse from lead poisoning all around pacific ocean. Mexican
    core that used to be literally full of gatlings is now empty, and Houston of Texas
    is on a non-stop rampage at the moment with great war infantry. Ay Caramba!

  narration: Brazil ground assault is grinding in to a halt against ferocious Argetinian
    defence, but the brazilwood bombers of Pedro are doing hell of a job. Jujuy is
    in yellow, no doubt a concentrated assault by great war infantry can break it.
    I think those planes are the death sentence of Argentina. If Brazil can capture
    all of Argentinan clay, they will rule supreme on SA, no doubt.

  narration: Kyoto is again in the pouch of Kangaroo. Not only that, but as a revenge,
    Aussies are carpet bombing Seoul! And Seoul is on the red! Korea has no planes
    which must mean that like their unfortunate brethren Finland, they don‘t have
    any oil! There is 17 australian planes here which could otherwise really mean
    the end for Korea, but aeroplanes are of little use against invisible submarines.
    I don’t believe Parkes can yet field an effective amphibious assault against Korea.
    Diggers maybe have a history of landings, but lets remember they lost at Gallipoli.

    Carthage is preparing an army to defend Saguntium, and its massing around Carthago Nova. It has a lot of people with pikes which is sub-optimal, but we have witnessed Carthage pull of insane stunts with shitty forces before. That was before #cossackgate though.

  narration: Victoria falls, breaking the back of Canadian air forces. On the other
    hand, Inuit land force around Sarnia is just simply gone. Guns of Hudson bay have
    extracted a heavy toll from invaders. Main western white walker force is currently
    sieging Oyuhpe, a not so important city. If Canada can hold the line at Charlottetown-Regina
    axis, there is yet hope. But it looks like the maple leaf is folding under the
    bayonet charges of Inuit infantry. White walkers are now pushing machine guns
    to the front, which means that counterattacks are out of question. Where are those
    artillery brigades from the US front?

  narration: Swedish air forces bring Corinth to the red, but looks like no Swedish
    unit can actually hope to capture it… yet. Also Sweden has ample resources of
    Uranium visible, with one already mined up next to Berlin and other next to Warsaw.
    It is starting to look like Kekkonen of Finland should already turn the sauna
    off and put the fishing rod away, it’s time to help spartans and claim that uranium.
    Also Finland has no planes but has machine guns, which means they are lacking
    in oil. I have the understanding that a certain scandinavian nation is pretty
    famous for its abundance of oil, and those reserves are most likely now occupied
    by Swedes.

    won every. Goddamn. War. They were ever part of, they did so with a shuddering
    ease. Its just a question of which nation they will next rodeo to. Mexico or Canada?

    Oh okay. There seems to be a global conspiracy to hunt the last remaining troops of dead nations down. This is pretty sinister actually, might make a good movie. Last stand of the Last legion sounds quite good.
    Also it clearly shows that Em has been spending time with her ’secret’ lover, that intel about Jandamarra going against Indonesia is so old that the intel report had to be carefully dug up by a crack team of elite archeologists.

    Harare and Boer commando contingent of Klerksderp are engaged in a pissing contest
    of citadel bombing, with Ayyubids taking collateral damage. That is, incidentally,
    the only kind of damage they are taking, with a successful defence against Carthage.

    And here as usual, the last picture is the religion map. Destruction of Israel has done nothing to stop the advance of Judaism, and the same can be said for Tibet and Akatt-U. And Shintoism and Japan. Catholicism is thriving and is the only religion in the world which is actively converting new pagans to the fold.
    It was a wild ride and hell of a job, thanks for /u/Tpangolin for letting me narrate and thanks for all the readers of this magnificent series! Comments about narrating are welcome in the thread. It was a pleasure.
