  narration: "<p>Another week, another CBRX episode, and this one is a juicy one. I'm this week's host, AlbinosRideDinos, and I've managed to get this narration slot while also being the worst Prediction Contest player. Goes to show that you don't have to be smart to narrate a part.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Today's OC is brought to you by /u/zccc. We have the tale of two fronts. Shikoku is doing all well and dandy on the east against Australia and Yup'ik, but the west is quite the opposite. Will the Shikoku turn it around?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here is the weekly hand drawn map from Vihreaan. The discussion in the reddit thread was that the Kazakhs have already won Endgame, but there are plenty of other world powers with the ability to crush their neighbors and pull ahead. Plenty of Endgame left to play, nobody's won just yet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Bonus OC comes from /u/holeeey and his amazing Paint 3D skills. Since the Kuikuro, Uruguay has had trouble moving through the Amazon. They'll need to overcome this hurdle if they ever want to unify South America.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here is the top ranked civ coming into this episode. I have no idea who it is as of writing this and with last week's episode having some top tier civs duking it out, I'm not going to make a guess so I don't look stupid…</p><p></p><p>I'm guessing it is the Kazakhs...</p>"

  narration: "<p>We start this part up in Scandinavia. The Sami DOW'd the Vikings last week, but their military composition is mostly archers. They have a few melee units but will have to use them smartly if they want to capture any cities off the Vikings.</p><p></p><p>The Vikings send a few Berserkers to pester Birka but not enough to threaten the city. The Vikings might just want to hold a stalemate on this front for a bit as they also have to defend their new Prussian holdings from the Goths.</p>"

  scene_title: "A New Foe has Appeared!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Today on The Final Flip!:</p><p></p><p>Prussia and the Moors have been looking to take Venice but a new challenger in Madagascar has traveled from far to try to grab the Final Flip. Madagascar has their UU next door but the Moors and Prussia have a larger army. All three are challenging to be today’s Final Flipper with the grand prize of Venice! Can Madagascar pull off the unthinkable? Will Prussia make up for their Vikings treaty? Will the Moors finally threaten to be the European top dog? Find out soon on... The Final Flip!</p><p></p><p>Also of note, Palmyra has given the Goths open borders, giving them a better path to fight Ragnar. The “Berlin Wall” strategy that Prussia previously used will not work for the Vikings this time.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the Shikoku-Qin Pacific front, Ryoma brings Wanxian down to half health. Shikoku has a bit more naval presence than the Qin, though the Qin are also fighting Australia at the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the top-right of the slide, you can see two one-city civs duking it out. Haida sends units across and around the Alaskan Peninsula to assault the Yup'ik. Haida wants one last moment of positivity in this game before it is too late.</p>"

  scene_title: "Unconquer West"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Shikoku looks to be doing fine on the water, on the land is a different story. Jadaran is facing pressure from the Qin and the Kazakhs. The Kazakhs are trying to prevent the Qin from taking the city by forming a Knight line separating Jadaran from the main Qin forces. Outstanding move.</p><p></p><p>Up north, Tura is solidly under Ablai Khan's control. Possibly all of India's army looks on to watch the mystical sight of a war being won.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Gosford flips back to Australia though both Taungoo and the Qin threaten to flip it back. The Qin star to make their way south after taking the Phillipines off of Australia's hands.</p><p></p><p>The Qin send a settler to lead the charge. Hawaii is unsettled, that might be a better location for him.</p>"

  scene_title: "F"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>And the winner of The Final Flip is… Prussia! Congratulations to Prussia and well played to the other contestants. We'll see you next time on… The Final Flip!</p><p></p><p>Press F to pay respects to the fallen Venetians. They had a solid little area Pre-E and only ever lost one city, Kirk Michael. Or was Kirk Michael a person? When Endgame started up, they were hit hard by the settler issue. With no settlers to start off with, they quickly fell behind other European civs and when they did get their settlers, they settled in easily-attackable locations and lost them quickly. At Part 0 they started ranked down in the 50's and ended up with a higher, yet still disappointing, 28th place finish.</p><p></p><p>There is still much more to talk about on this slide. Prussia is still at war with the Moors. The Moors could flip back Venice with trebuchets and melee units next door. Madagascar is done here, though. They will have to walk all the way home empty handed.</p><p></p><p>Palmyra and the Manx both DOW Prussia. Palmyra is probably hoping to get free real-estate off a peace deal again. The Manx look to grab Stetin after ignoring it for much of their previous war. With Moorish help, Stetin looks conquerable this time.</p><p></p><p>The Goths and the Sami enter the Vikings' borders near Königsberg but with Prussian peacekeepers, they will struggle a bit to move forward. I think there is a better place for those pikemen but you do you, Frederick.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shikoku captures Wanxian and sets it ablaze. Ryoma has a settler in Sukumo that he might send to Wanxian's ashes to start anew. The Qin navy is not overpowering Shikoku, but they offset this with a solid mainland army in the war.</p><p></p><p>The Qin found a hole to send his Rui Shi UU's towards Tosa-Shimizu. The city is still at full health, but that's a lot of horses. Quick recap, the Rui Shis combat-wise are identical to the Horsemen they replace.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile in the Top-Right War™,  Haida enters Yup'ik territory with a swordie and a War Canoe. Will Haida snipe the Yup'ik's final city, just as the Yup'ik did to the Qing and the Aztecs?</p>"

  scene_title: "Zimbab-Ways Away From Home"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Taungoo's attack on Brisbane from last episode fizzled out. Their few galleasses in the area decide to blockade the mainland Australian cities rather than actually threaten a city capture.</p><p></p><p>Zimbabwe caravans two settlers to the Australian coast. Just like what they did on the Arabian and Indian Peninsula, Zimbabwe looks to plop down another town far away from home.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "The Bob Emergency"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the last slide, you probably saw that Australia and the Qin have filed for peace. No cities were exchanged in the peace deal and now Australia can focus their effort on the Goo. First order of business is to take back Gosford which is currently under Taungoo colors.</p><p></p><p>Bob Hawke will have to fight his way towards mainland Asia if he wants to finish better than second in this game. Otherwise, he will go the way as so many other Bobs.</p>"

  scene_title: "Wanx On"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Qin flip back Wanxian, but with enemy horses nearby and low defense, it will flip back to Shikoku soon enough. On land, even though the Qin's Rui Shis are parked right outside of Tosa-Shimizu, no damage has been done to the city.</p><p></p><p>The Top-Right War™ is still ongoing. Haida send some more units to sail past their previously-owned now-burning city of Kung into Yup'ik territory. I only see one military unit belonging to Yup'ik, let's see if it can expel the Haidan force.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "The True Final Flip Winner"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>You might have noticed in the mini-map on the previous slide that the Moors have taken Venice from Prussia. On this slide, the two file for peace with Venice remaining Moorish. The Venetitian Great Admiral watches on, knowing his country is gone for good.</p><p></p><p>Prussia only has the Manx to worry about now, and if the last war between the two was any indication, they should be okay. Stettin took some damage but with the Moors out of the picture, Prussia only has to deal with a single foe.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a Prussian swordie blocks the entrance for Goth units into Potsdam. Ragnar reinforces the area a bit with Berserkers and looks to be okay for the time being.</p>"

  scene_title: "Failed Diplomacy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Qin capture Jadaran by forcing one of their UU's past the Kazakh Knight line. Ryoma has enough melee units to flip it back, but so do the Kazakhs.</p><p></p><p>Up north, the Kazakh Knights reinforce Tura to handle Ryoma's swordies. The next stop up there would be the capital Kochi. Unless something dramatic happens, Ryoma should hold on up there for now.</p><p></p><p>Does the notification log say that we filed for peace with the Qin? Is that right? And we didn't receive any cities? Who's in charge here? I think it is time to riot.</p><p>Lime's note: That notification indicates that the Qin have access to the Khamug UU and UB, Jadaran is the former Khamug capital.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Berserker Gambit"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Looks like this war is going well for the Vikings, at least for now. They surround Birka with Berserkers, and bring it down to about 60% health. The Sami strategy to arrow the opponent to death isn't working out so well right now. If Ragnar flips Birka, the only nearby Sami unit to flip it back is a knight. The Viking backside is looking a little sparse. They'll need to rebuild on the fly to keep the pressure on.</p><p></p><p>For the defense of Königsberg, the Vikings are holding on okay. The Prussian peacekeepers are doing a solid job to deny a coastal route to the city.</p>"

  scene_title: "Portal 3 When?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>India keeps on chugging along. Unlike the last two parts, there is no Portal 3 song to sing here. With mountains between them and certain death, they should be around for a bit longer. Shivaji could just end India's game if they feel like it.</p><p></p><p>Up North, we see the Nepalese wars with the Kazakhs and Parthia. Both civs only have empty hills to pass through until they hit Pokhara, but the bottlenecks might be enough for Pokhara to remain in Nepal's hands for the foreseeable future.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "The Continuing Seize"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Qin made a bit of progress attacking Tosa-Shimizu, but the two adjacent Rui Shis are nearly dead. We'll have to see if the Qin can keep up the onslaught. In the Pacific, Wanxian remains under the Qin, and Ryoma has not put up an effort to recapture it.</p><p></p><p>Up in the top right, the Top-Right War™ continues. The Yup'ik pushed Haida out of their yard, and mustered enough units to defend their capital from the Haidan menace.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "The Top-Right™ Treaty"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Top-Right™ War comes to a close, as it is now neither a war, nor top right. Haida did damage Cev'aq a bit, though they probably weren't nearly close enough to actually taking it. Kung is still burning, but Haida could swoop in with their settler and rebuild the city.</p><p></p><p>The war between the Metis and Shikoku is still ongoing. Louis Riel sends a pair of Knights towards Sirenik but that won't be enough to capture the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "The Cold Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Greenland front between the Sami and Vikings is the one quiet front of the war. No battles are being fought in this area, besides a small faith battle between Sunni and Catholicism.</p><p></p><p>The Moors plopped down the city of Al-Gazirah Al-Hadra in Iceland. I'm surprised that this area went unsettled for so long.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Canton & Friends"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>As seen on the sidebar from the last slide, Taungoo and Canton DOW Shikoku. Canton is now completely engulfed by the Goo and the Qin, and with both as allies against Shikoku. Canton is taking a diplomatic path towards self-preservation. She also has a few units outside her borders where maybe, just maybe, she could snipe a city from Ryoma.</p><p></p><p>Maratha has also DOW'd Shikoku. Ryoma is really not liked this time around.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "The Trireme Dream"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Birka was flipped by Ragnar but Eadni flipped it back with a trireme, a knight, and a dream. With only a Berserker to fight off, the Sami should be able to hold it. The Sami also have a solid hold of the Norwegian Sea. The Vikings might want to file for peace at this point. I don't see the war getting any better for them.</p><p></p><p>Yup'ik gets DOW'd by many, though none are as threatening as Haida just was.</p>"

  scene_title: "We'll head them off at the Pass!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Both the Kazakhs and Parthia have not been able to navigate the mountains into Nepal. On the opposite side of Nepal, with open borders from Taungoo, Maratha has units knocking on the door of the Nepalese capital. Can Maratha do what the others cannot?</p><p></p><p>Zimbabwe built Torre Del Oro, which is the first Enlightenment Era wonder built so far. Torre Del Oro grants +1 Culture, +2 Great Merchant Points, and buffs naval trade routes originating from the city in which it was built.</p>"

  scene_title: "Illiam's New “Empire”"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Illiam: "You've turned this war against me"</p><p></p><p>Abd-ar: “You've done that yourself”</p><p></p><p>Illiam fails to bring peace, freedom, justice, or security to his empire as without Moorish help, as the Manx war on Prussia reversed fortune. Burano has been taking damage from a Prussian assault. If Prussia stops peacekeeping their old territory for the Vikings, and sends those units toward the Manx, they can possibly force the Manx off the mainland. The Vikings veto the proposal.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "The Blob"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Qin take Tosa-Shimizu and look to hold it. A blob of their UU march on to Nakamura and Yuzuki. This could be the point where Shikoku just collapses.</p><p></p><p>Oko 2.0 to the west is knocked down to half health by the Kazakh Knights. With only an inferior siege weapon to defend, Oko 2.0 looks prime to fall.</p><p></p><p>Also, shoutouts to Canton for putting effort into their war with Shikoku. 100% heart.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "A Timely Treaty"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Australia and Taungoo file for peace. Australia seems to have flipped Queanbeyan right before the treaty, so they will keep the city. If I was a Taungoo fan, I would have preferred to have kept at least one of Gosford or Queanbeyan. Taungoo will need to recoup and rebuild as their avenues for expansion are closing.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "5 Points!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Sami archer carpet has worked out well, bringing the Viking capital, Nidaros, down to half health. They have enough triremes to capture the capital, and even possibly hold it. The Vikings military has really shriveled up, and there are no Prussian peacekeepers to help them up here.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "The Palmyran Prawns"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Whenever I have hope that an offensive on Nepal could start working, Nepal proves me wrong. Blah blah mountains, blah blah rough terrain, blah blah mountain passes. Yeah, you've heard it before.</p><p></p><p>On the flipside, with open borders from Maratha, Palmyran Prawns have a decent shot of finally finishing India. India's plan for defense is the tried and somewhat proven strategy of running away with a settler. This time, there really isn't anywhere to settle.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Around the World x144"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>If you remember from Pre-E, Bunbury was a cursed city that was razed to the ground by Papua, then resettled in the exact same place in the exact same war by Australia, then captured again by Papua. Endgame Bunbury seems a little better off on the southern point of New Zealand.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Mutota, who now refers to himself as “Mr. Worldwide,” looks to put a claim to New Zealand. The settler we saw earlier settled on the southwest area of Australia where IRL Bunbury is located. Mr. Worldwide also settled Sri Lanka earlier this part.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Ulterior Motive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Maybe the Prussian peacekeepers weren't so peacekeepery after all? Prussia finds a hole to attack the undefended, once-Prussian, city of Berlin while still preventing the Goths and Sami from putting up any sort of offensive on Königsberg.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Nidar oh no"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a big blow to Ragnar, Nidaros falls to Eadni. I don't think the Vikings can mount enough of a force to flip it back. For whatever hope the Vikings had to win this game, it is now gone. With a continuously shrinking army, the Vikings will not be able to climb out of this hole and will now join the rumps.</p><p></p><p>At least there is always Greenland for Ragnar's retirement...</p>"

  scene_title: "D-d-d-double Kill"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>With a single prawn, Palmyra finishes off India. There honestly isn't a whole lot to say about India. They started off the game by not doing much besides getting into meat-grinders with Nepal. Later into Pre-E, the only thing she was doing to remain relevant was holding nukes and being speculated she would be the first one to fire one off. But she didn't. In Endgame, much like Venice, but by her own faults, she failed to settle, lost pretty much every war, sang a couple Portal songs, and died.</p><p></p><p>Maybe that settler will find a nice quiet location to start anew, but unless that happens, F.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Even though the last time we saw Oko 2.0 it was surrounded by Kazakh Knights, the Qin managed to take it with their Rui Shi. That marks two cities sniped out of Kazakh hands. </p><p></p><p>The Qin march their UU blob toward Yuzuki. The Shikoku are on dire straits. Much like the Vikings, their better days are behind them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qin and Uruguay settle a couple of islands in the Pacific. This is free food for Australia if they put any sort of naval presence in the area. A Nazcan longsword watches as the nearby islands are settled, they think to themselves, “Wow! Settling these islands! Why didn't we think of that?”</p>"

A few ships bring Matsuyama to half health, while the Kazakh Knights start pounding the walls of the Shikoku capital.</p><p></p><p>The Qin have ignored Nakamura so far.

  narration: "<p>In only a single turn by the Qin, Nakamura's health is halved. With Yuzuki also below half, the next Qin turn will end with both of those cities in a navy blue color. Kochi hasn't gotten worse, but it might be the Blob's next focus.</p><p></p><p>The Pacific front has calmed down with no city on either side under threat. Ying Zheng mentioned it was because “My Rui Shi can't swim.” Solid analysis, thanks Zheng!</p>"

  narration: "<p>If you've been watching the notification log, you've seen the flipping and flopping of the Viking capital. Nidaros is in the Vikings' hand, and I don't see a Sami melee unit nearby to flip it back. The Viking military has been exhausted. With still two fronts to worry about (Greenland doesn't count), I wonder how much longer Ragnar can hold on for.</p><p></p><p>Hiawatha builds Uffizi giving them some culture.

  narration: "<p>The Sami flip Nidaros back and smartly build a horse in Birka in case the Vikings flip it back. The Vikings core looks smaller and smaller with each passing slide. The best they can hope for is to grab Nidaros back and peace out. The Sami archer carpet is still in solid shape.</p><p></p><p>On a not so dim note for the Vikings, Västerås and Hedeby are both at full health even though the Sami have ranged units two tiles out. With so few units to deal with, I'm surprised that the Sami have not pushed into this area more.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yuzuki was flipped, and the Qin would rather have Yuzuki burnt to a crisp than dealing with the flipping. The Blob continues their march north. The Blob never ends. The Blob consumes all</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ablai… why? Shikoku gets a much needed peace deal with the Kazakhs, giving up no cities and flipping Matsuyama right before the deal. Kazakhs obtain no additional cities from Shikoku this part, while their top tier neighbors in the Qin have thoroughly dismantled the southern Shikoku holdings. With the Qin still grabbing cities, the last half of the war must be disappointing for the Kazakhs.</p><p></p><p>The Qin change their pyromaniac ways and Yuzuki is no longer on fire. The city is still in danger of flipping for the next few turns.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Taungoo have their UU online, the White War Elephant. This replaces the knight and gives a bit of culture and golden age points when they kill a foe. They also start with the Woodsman promotion giving them extra movement through forest and jungle.</p><p></p><p>Also, Uruguay built Himeji Castle which will help them thwart off any pesky Venezuelans in their territory.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qin peace out with Shikoku without any extra cities in the deal and are immediately DOW'd by the Kazakhs and Australia. Australia doesn't have a whole lot of naval power in this area, so I wonder if it was the Kazakhs who dragged them into this war. Mount Gambier has only a Knight garrisoned protecting the island from the nearby Qin Galleases.</p><p></p><p>Mad that his “rightfully deserved” Shikoku cities were sniped by Ying Zheng, Kazakhs will look to take on the Blob by surprise and snag them back. We'll have to see if the Kazakh Knights are well equipped to face the blob.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Nidaros flips to the Sami once again. Västerås is now in the black with a Knight next door. Ryoma had two solid, though late, peace deals in a row. Ragnar should take notes.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene53.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kazakh-Qin front has just started with not much activity so far. The Blob is a little less of a blob here, but still solid enough to not get immediately overrun. The Rui Shis that make up the Blob are horsemen replacements, and don't give any extra combat boost. If the Qin upgrade them, they can bring the pain to the Kazakhs. If not, the Kazakhs will benefit greatly from the combat differential</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng, disgusted at this betrayal by Ablai Khan, sends a message to Ablai that reads (paraphrased), “Screw you and your neighbor!” The Qin have DOW'd the Goths.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see what remains of Shikoku. Ryoma did well to keep what he had left in his peace deals but with mostly tundra cities and top tier civs nearby, Shikoku is done being aggressive. He can take out the Yup'ik for giggles but his large-scale conquering days are behind him.</p><p></p><p>Much of the Blob is hanging around this area. The Qin will look to move it over to the Kazakh front as their presence here is no longer needed.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oko took a bit of damage but the Kazakhs will have to deal with a single land tile to feed their units through. A little bit south, the Qin have made a bit of progress towards the city of Karamergen. The issue for the Qins is that their new Shikoku cities are puppeted and will have to migrate units from a bit farther away to reinforce this Kazakh front.</p><p></p><p>The Qin force the Metis and Benin into the war against the Goths. No of these so far are a threat to the Goths, though other civs might soon join in.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mount Gambier predictably took some damage. Australia could reinforce the city with the nearby Galleasses but have decided not to. To the west, Gosford is doing much better this war than the beating it took against Taungoo and the Qin earlier. Shanwu and Mount Gambier look to be the only cities in danger between the two civs so far.</p><p></p><p>An Iroquois explorer from far away watches on.

  narration: "<p>Things are just getting worse for Ragnar. Västerås falls, Nidaros is gone for good, and the army is a shell of itself. If it weren't for the Prussians, the Vikings capital could have ended up in Greenland.</p><p></p><p>For the Sami, their existential threat is the Kazakhs. These Viking conquests should help them keep pace with the Kazakhs a bit but not a lot. They still have much work to do</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qin and Australia trade cities in Shanwu and Mount Gambier and each light them aflame. The Qin have a bit of a navy to continue on but this seems like the end of any major fighting in this area.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene61.jpg
  narration: "<p>The combat strength disparity between the Rui Shis and the knights are being put on display. The Kazakhs push the Qin out of their territory and bring Oko down to half and dented Changzhi. The Qin respond by bringing the Blob over. The Kazakhs will have to punch through a lot of the Rui Shis if Ablai wants a chance to take on the Qin's core cities.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene62.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oko falls to the Kazakhs but the nearby Rui Shis could flip it back. The Qin moved their reinforcements north, possibly to flip back Oko but leave Changzhi a little under-defended.</p><p></p><p>The Kazakhs also DOW the Vikings. They might have a bit of space they can attack Königsberg, but hopefully this new war doesn't distract them from this more important war with the Qin.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Vikings make peace with the Sami, but at a great cost. Nidaros is Sami, Västerås burned to the ground, and Ribe is given up and put to the torch. The Vikings can now focus on their war with the Goths, but will also have to handle any random Kazakh and Madagascar units.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If you didn't notice on the minimap, Potsdam was also given away in the peace treaty. Not sure what is upsetting the Sami as they have razed every city they took from the Vikings besides the capital. Ragnar joins the three city club.</p><p></p><p>On a good note for the Vikings, the Kazakhs don't seem to have the open borders they need to attack the Vikings. Even then, they would need to dodge the Prussian peacekeepers. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of the peacekeepers, just take Berlin already, Frederick. There hasn't been a single Prawn in the area yet Berlin has been at green the entire part. Just tap it in.</p>"

Thank You Ranavalona. </p><p></p><p>This is also our first view of Mutota's  Mr. Worldwide's Sri Lankan outpost. Maratha has all those settlers but never did anything with them and now Sri Lanka flies Zimbabwe's colors. So lazy Maratha. Shame.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene66.jpg
  narration: "<p>The never-ending Nepalese offense switches hands as the Kazakhs peace out while Taungoo tags in. Taungoo probably has the best shot at taking Kathmandu with two adjacent non-mountain tiles and an extra mountain pass nearby. Can Taungoo do what everyone else couldn't?</p><p></p><p>The Kazakh assault on Yongcheng has damaged the city a bit. They have a decent number of units nearby to keep on the pressure. Much like Nepal, the Qin are using the natural mountain defenses to their advantage.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene67.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oko is still Kazakh, Changzhi has nearly fallen, and Didao and Jadaran have both taken damage. The Blob is being outclassed by the combative strength Kazakh Knights, and the Blob is starting to look more like a bleb. Changzhi will soon fall, but the Kazakhs don't have a whole lot of units outside this front line. They will need to restock from their cities in case the war drags out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Shikoku-Metis war is still ongoing if you were wondering. Wood Mountain has taken some damage but is not in danger of falling.</p><p></p><p>Gift Lake was settled near the location where Kung burned down earlier. The Metis did quite a bit of settling out their lands this part, including Lac Saint-Anne.</p><p></p><p>Ryoma, angry that he was bullied for so long, bullies the Yup'ik by citadeling all the way up the Cev'aq. Rude.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qin resettle Shanwu on the next island north of Mount Gambier's ashes. Australia reinforced this area with galleasses and could threaten the Qin's islands, but Bob Hawke assigned them to a more defensive formation.</p><p></p><p>We can also barely see Venezuela's Hawaii. Chavez settled the entire island chain this part, after the islands were unsettled for so long.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Speaking of Venezuela, they DOW Australia. Their first offense comes by way of five Caravels bringing Whyalla down to 60% health. Each caravel is now at about 60% health as well, so, as long as Australia reinforces the island just a bit, Whyalla should be okay.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode44-scene72.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs capture Changzhi. If you look at the minimap, Oko is back under their control as well. The attack on Yongcheng has stagnated, but the Kazakhs still have a funnel of units heading that way. The production gap tilts in the Kazakhs favor and several new military units are coming in for backup.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well, the new Shanwu did not last long. Australia was able to send their galleases to surround and take down the island city. On the flipside, Australia left Gosford lightly defended and the Qin move in. The city is not yet damaged but a Nazcan trireme bottlenecks the incoming Australian fleet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With the final slide, we take a look at the Moorish core. They have a solid carpet with their UU, the Granadine Cavalry, up and running. They replace crossbows and have some extra movement capability. The Moors' army has a decent tech lead on their African and European neighbors.</p><p></p><p>That was a wild part. India and Venice perished. Shikoku, the Vikings, and Prussia all lost a lot. The Qin were betrayed by the Kazakhs after their joint war on Shikoku. Mr. Worldwide settled Australia. A crazy war happened between the Yup'ik and Haida. We saw a tile owned by Madagascar. Insane.</p><p></p><p>Seems like every civ was active doing something this week… except Nubia. Even when fighting the next-door Zimbabwe, they didn't get a mention.</p><p></p><p>I'm AlbinosRideDinos and I hoped you enjoyed this week's episode. We'll see you on the next one. PEACE!</p>"
