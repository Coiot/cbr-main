  narration: "<p>Hey there folks! My name is TPangolin, and it's an absolute honor to be aboard the Cybersub once more to herald in the new season of our beloved CBR - the OG narrative prompt generator that ChatGPT wishes it was. It's that time of year again where we gather for the collective watching of the dance of 61 Civs resolving their dynastically long diplomatic disputes on the battlefield ~ and earning our hearts in the process!</p><p></p><p>I have to say that the viewdeck bridge is feeling *quite* claustrophobic given how crammed it is with people, but I understand that many of you have waited for these prime spots for hours now - so with that being said proceedings will be underway shortly after a few announcements ~</p><p></p><p>As your first captain of the ship, what I want you to remember foremost: </p><p>Whilst this is a game where you have no influence or control, remember that (paradoxically) when it comes down to it - YOU actually have more influence than anybody. YOU are the ones that control the beat of the narrative drum, YOUR song pushes forth sacrilegious agendas, YOU are the pattern recognizers, and the gambling addicts that speculate on where Civs will land in this grand pachinko board of interconnected gameplay systems; where obscene events may only be possible due to Rube-Goldberg style shenanigans! </p><p></p><p>Be vigilant: Be the eyes that see what others can't! Take influence from the in-game civs… and make bold predictions for yourself that you have no idea will pay off or not. </p><p></p><p>But alas, I am so excited for all of you to be joining, and for all the folks rejoining me in reacclimatising ourselves from cryo-stasis to an even spicier Antarctic wind. Now…. Let us all witness the glory present in the greatest ethical dilemma simulator 2026 could offer us, on an epic voyage through time (and not so much space), to an experience that I’ve read on Kotaku is significantly “greater than Civilization 5 with the Brave New World expansion pack”.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Need a refresher on all the personalities whimsically waging digital warfare on your handheld devices? EmeraldRange has a great series of accessible writeups to introduce you to our candidates for Cylindrical domineering.  I have trust that this will encourage people enough to do further readings about these incredible cultures and peoples, beyond just their unique component entries!In general the modding community has been knocking it out of the park when it comes to representation, and sets a standard that I would still love to see from all mainstream 4X developers. Much of the CBR reveals the negative space of the game - not just in terms of its technical limitations - so it’s been beautiful to see how well the modding community has matured to be attuned to hearing and actively listening to voices from spaces and cultures 4X games traditionally don’t develop in mind for.</p><p>A consolidated writeup with infographics can be found here: http://reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/1qfip9h/cbrx5_civ_blurbs_writeups_consolidated/And a list of Civ abilities and additional info can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KMH0yqYJU1HRYac1Vl2NdKVFIPYepRPbZu8U1zvxKCk/edit?usp=sharing</p><p></p><p>Also a reminder for the modset used: </p><p></p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/1q49z9v/season_5_gameplay_modset</p><p>Also big shoutout to /u/Orangechrisy for another amazing iteration of the Lazy Portugal show - a continuation of what started 10 years ago by /u/MetroGoldyMayer:https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/1qbawgi/its_the_lazy_portugal_show_12/</p><p></p><p>And also the BIGGEST possible shout out to all the OG Mk.2 authors, writers, and producers of comics, podcasts, novels, artworks, stand-alone sites, programs, mods, cartography, analyses, power rankings etc. etc. I am still enraptured by being a part of such an experience where we saw the birth of Great Works every variety!!</p><p></p><p></p>"

  narration: "<p>Resident cartographer /u/Sonicfan0511 provides us with our first paint-by-numbers/join-the-dots sheet. I would love for anyone to use this as a template to predict how civs will be developing during different Turn-’X’ milestones, and to compare and contrast how laughably wrong or worryingly right we were ~</p><p></p><p>On a tangent, I absolutely love the mis-en-scene associated with the CBR, where our omnipresence allows us to visualise things the in-game Civs cannot comprehend. But considering how each civ is seeing things through their perspective is even more interest piquing - Civs might see the the Ocean but not engage because their line of sight is developing down another narrow field, and thus they might not discover the advantages of a port-city or a need for any aquatic techs at all. </p><p></p><p>But while yes, we can opine that civs don’t have the greatest optimal start locations for their performance within a Domination only game; a thought exercise: if we apply agency to the entities within each Civ, perhaps there is internal debate them over whether or not cities should even be optimized for perpetual warfare? (which, fair enough - probs be okay to cut them some slack). </p><p></p><p>In the case where things are optimised for never-ending conflict, I whole-heartedly hope (and expect) to see people closely tracking particularly experienced battalions of units, and where Great Generals and Admirals are captured to mutinously turn the tide of battle. </p><p></p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/1q9rktw/cbrx5_episode_0_map/</p>"

  narration: "<p>For all those that have been consistent supporters of this project throughout this past decade, I truly don't have the proper words to express my gratitude for you all! Through calamities and riots, your ardent belief in the power of community-led storytelling has led to a tangibly empowered community. It’s been wonderful to hear stories of everything people have done and accomplished because of the space this sub provides. I have a pride that cannot be rationalised because all the credit belongs with you. To raise the flag in solidarity to our ‘Kuyas’, please consider donating to keep this project ongoing for perpetuity. All should be giving a massive thanks to /u/Coiot and /u/LacsiraxAriscal for their everpresent dedication and ethos to the values at the very core of the project!!A Side Note: A reason I find the CBR fascinating is because the root of the game's objective morality is an unchanging victory condition that affects Civ behavior, and therefore the 'lived' perspectives of the Civs in the game about their reasoning and justification for warfare.</p><p> </p><p>In this ep we ask ourselves of the self-awareness of these Civs, not just of the CBR itself, but of this ‘Domination-only victory condition’ amongst the population - Is it a biological innateness given for the purposes of this simulation? Or is this just another case of the systemic end result of an immortal hierarchy of top-down leadership engaged in egotistical personality squabbles?</p><p> </p><p>If the latter is the case then it stands to reason that not everyone within the CBR-verse is onboard with their world being *in essence*: a genocide simulator; a sentiment of which I'm sure that we can relate to ourselves given the current state of our world and the leaders trying to play CBR IRL in it.So with this being said, if you're unable to find time to support the CBR and its community - there is a world of other communities going through hardships that could love your tangible presence ~ in ways that aren't purely monetary. Much love and solidarity to those fighting the hard fight. </p><p></p>"

  narration: "<p>With the greatest deference of respect, the Pomo people have named Essie Parrish to their Pantheon as God-Queen. Unfazed or probably too hyperfocused on basket-weaving to notice, Auntie Essie probably just told the party heralding the announcement “oh that’s nice, there are some baskets in the corner if you need to store any of those offerings to your fancy new Queen”. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Rather than staring down into the depressing fishless abyss of Titicaca, Capac the kingfisher has opened up the sky as a place of Faith claiming that their nets can be used to catch the ‘fish-of-the-sky’ (birds) too. In all honesty though, +1 Faith from Plains could be what saves the Caral from an early extinction event. If they establish their God of the Open Sky as one that is locally recognised, they could then play the role of a Pre-Francis South American Pope that could rather whimsically wield the DoWarhammer.</p><p>We should also note that according to the mini-map:</p><p>-  the Rapa Nui as of this stage have not chosen a second city location. Could they reach Uluru prior to the Bunuba?</p><p>- Both the Itelmen and Ket appear to be up to 4 cities now.</p><p>- Green Ukraine heads north and gives Japan more room to breathe.Wow: that was a THOUSAND YEARS? Sure felt like it, but curious that none of you look any older. Must be the air down here. </p><p>  That’s where we leave it for today folks ~Thanks again to the eternal supporters of the cybersub. You have my undying, immortal love. I genuinely hope that my words meet standards that have likely evolved throughout these years! </p><p>        </p><p>For those of y'all who are now alongside me, are just rejoining us in the many, many years since Mk. 2 - it's been an honour to welcome y’all back to the chaos that shaped so many of our lives in the strangest ways many will never understand. But if you do have the time, I’d love to hear of the rabbit holes the CBR has sent you down!</p><p></p><p>Let us pray that our own personal hiatuses don't take too long, and that in the future we're not returning here ~ 40 Years Later ~. </p><p></p><p>But until then (hopefully not) ~</p><p></p><p>Much love,</p><p>Jett/TPangolin </p><p></p><p></p>"
