  narration: "<p>Hello hello once more, it is I, Orangechrisy, back again for the 5th episode for the 5th time, because nepotism of course (love you Coiot <3). Now, a bit over three years ago, during MkX3, I said I would infiltrate the dev server, and I can confirm that I have succeeded! Back in November our great gamerunner Lacs asked me if I could help do some tests because no one else was around for some reason. I said sure, but that it was like the day before EU5 came out and I’d be playing that for a week straight so I can help out after. I got invited into the server, and then a couple days later Lacs did something to get past the crash cycle she was stuck in, and thus we are here. With me in the dev server despite having done absolutely nothing.</p><p></p><p>ANYWAYS: Oh boy, this is the second royale I’ve had my own civ in (I had Malacca in CBRX2), so as such I am going to be quite biased towards Pomo throughout this. I hope they do well, because as always, I do not read ahead. So come along with me, as we venture into this world of the worst plays known to man. </p>"

However in my rush I forgot to add some shading to it. D: I’ve been trying out a new style this time and I’m not sure how well it gets compressed but oh well.</p>"

I’m sorry to those who want a map here but I’ve actually rushed out two comics this week, my weekly one and another Lazy Portugal Show! (Well, I finished it earlier today, but I’ll be posting it tomorrow morning (Saturday)). The original Lazy Portugal Show was what pushed me to make my comics, and I have been so happy to see all the OC this season. Thank you Archimedes and Sketo and Nope and Emerald and anyone else making civball comics and other OCs, though also lmao I get to be a selfish bitch. :3</p>"

Bunuba, despite their losses, or maybe because of them, develop new beliefs for their faith.</p><p></p><p>Bunuba jumped way up to second in the rankings based on the hype over this war, hype that did not live up, but that’s not to say they aren’t doing well. Both Australian civs are at the top of the stats and Bunuba has a whopping 9 cities to NSW’s 8. Alas for them both, they are trapped in the land down under.</p>"

Bunuba on the other hand gets Missionary Zeal for stronger Missionaries and Altars, faith buildings granting +2 Happiness +1 Faith and +1 Tourism.</p><p></p><p>Also it doesn’t get mentioned further so Phoenicia and the Papacy make peace, and Wassoulou joins the Sumer hate train.</p>"

Though if the Pope settles where they are (which I *think* they might be able to with that coastal city distance mod?) it will be quite the easy city to take, especially as the Pope is about to be at least somewhat distracted by the French, for however good the French might be.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Rumblings are loud in the new home of government for the Kongsi Federation, the republic in heated debate over who to blame over the failure of the Ternate war. The recently in power lawmakers of Mao’en planted the blame on the complacent bureaucrats of the capital in fiery shouts and even deadlier writings. The battle rages hotter than it ever did at sea. </p><p></p><p>Lanfang makes the Forum Magnum in a city that isn’t even their capital. It gives +2 Great Magistrate points and a free Magistrate Court in every city, something related to JFD’s Rise To Power I believe. I don’t know how useful that is at all.</p>"

The past few years have been rough, but Humabon believed that with this change, he might be able to assert enough authority to succeed in the war. Yet as is the folly with so many kings, they fail to think further ahead, no settlers in sight, Cebu continues to fall behind. The Rajah, feet planted firmly on the wooden dock, remains adrift among a sea of true conquerors.</p>"

  narration: "<p>See I don’t want to like, go back to the previous slide and edit the wording to be a different last word cause I like what it was, but now it feels a bit weird to use conqueror and then conquest so close together. Yet stupid dumb annoying Ismail Berzeg of Circassia got proclaimed as “the Conqueror” for some unknown reason, despite only ever being in one war which has seen no units die, their current war against Sumer, because they joined in like a lemming and apparently being a follower who hasn’t done anything worthy of recognition is enough to be seen as the God of the High Heavens. Fuck off Berzeg, I conquered your mom last night.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Amina seemingly got tired of sitting around in her own failing civ and decided to become a general for hire in a different failing civ, Yunnan, of infamous CBRX5 Episode 4 Slide 68 notoriety. Egads, what a horrific blunder. They have three more settlers out, maybe that’ll do them some good. Maybe that’ll let them give away more cities to Tang for no reason because they are- y’know maybe I need to take a breather.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mysore is, doing well. Yeah. Doing well. Mid tier stats held up by an impressive military, but well enough expansion opportunities and a good shot at dominating the subcontinent. Two more settlers are about to make their homes in the north, preventing themselves from being cut off by their two neighbors and giving some access to Kashmir and Nepal maybe. Solid core here, would be nice if they take Rajshahi, or build some boats to take Khulna.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Xavante is still alive! Wow! Still sucks to be them though, as they are pretty fully blocked in, and they can’t really fight out of here any time soon as the terrain is just awful. We also see the failures of expansion here: Potiguara has encroached fully in the east, there is no place for Xavante to get anything down there despite that settler heading into a small gap. There is a spot on the north coast I believe but Potiguara has not one but two settlers nearing it. There’s also a spot just to the south but Guaycuru is rapidly approaching it and has a settler two tiles below it, but Xavante has one two tiles above it. Maybe it’ll be an even draw, unless Guaycuru moves a unit onto it first, which they probably will do.</p><p></p><p>Anyways Guaycuru’s culture sucks ass they still haven’t gotten Cerro de Potosi yet despite it being in range of their capital, nor either of the two luxuries next to Potosi. Really quite shameful of a display.</p>"

It immediately proves effective at sending Amina’s government-in-regency-while-Amina-is-fucking-off-to-Yunnan into enough of a panic to quickly sue for peace. </p>"

  narration: "<p>This one goes out to my greatest rival Archimedes: Teo ain’t shit come at me bro.</p><p></p><p>Okay actual analysis: Teo moves to settle El Salvador, and has another settler up north ready to move out. However their progress against Karankawa is still nothing. Karankawa themselves have settled Coco on the Mississippi, forcing Ponca to go further east, and they have another settler around Cujane doing who knows what. But I think what’s most important is Karankawa’s fighting itself. First of all they have three triremes, and their workboat UU (the Dug-Out) converts to a trireme when it makes a fishing boat, and with the damage Hix Witz has taken there’s a slight chance Karankawa can actually take it, though it’s probably unlikely. More so than that though, Karankawa’s UA gives them speed near rivers, makes defeating units spawn Holly or Oysters, and their units heal/gain culture when defeating units when on said unique resources. It’s a very good UA for a grindy war like this one, so good job to Teo for giving at least a minor boost to Karankawa, they needed it, what a nice guy.</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Did I speak too soon?” I say to my archnemesis Archimedes as the next slide shows Behe’pal beheing beheaten up by Tlingit triremes. But no, I did not. Because those triremes aren’t nearly enough to take the city, especially with the city attack + archer + chariot archer + soon a second chariot archer raining arrows down upon the ships. More importantly both civs have settlers out both heading northeastwards. Lot of land out there to claim.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Two new cities settle around Iberia, the French place Nantes in Andorra (and they do settle Le Havre-Marat in Brittany), while Portugal goes further east to settle Gaia on the Balearic Island(s). Both civs also have secondary settlers hanging around, France looking to settle in northern Iberia while Portugal heads to maybe Barcelona. After those, there should still be another spot in the center to grab too. C’mon João, don’t let a repeat of Hastings happen.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Eagle eyed viewers last episode (which is to say I think Nope or whoever it was) may have seen this, a Tarkhan, the Kipchak UU, under Circassian control. This is the Kipchak UA at play! Most obviously seen through its UU since only it can get it, but the Kipchaks can have their units become mercenaries sold to other civs, gaining bonuses when they return after 30 turns.

Yep, Rapa Nui too! Not really sure why this is the case, but oh well.</p><p></p><p>We also can see with this map how the spread of religions have ended up. As said, Hyksos is the only one in Africa and Western Europe remains empty. Eastern Asia is also empty, as well as Caral being the only religion in South America (no Rapa Nui doesn’t count).

He is of course the advisor to the king, Great King Maria of Portugal, so it can only be a monarchy. Yet here he is, on the Cylinder once more, in charge of ruling Portugal, without his dear king who he has a very complicated relationship with. So what is he to do when the Portuguese people say “We have a crown for you,” but sit and think about the crown that used to be there. After a while of sitting and thinking he accepts the crown, Portugal is a monarchy after all, but is it really right for him to wear it?</p><p></p><p>The picture moves only slightly but it is enough for Aveiro to be settled, leaving the center still open for perhaps that settler up near Porto. Anyways this means next time I make a Lazy Portugal Show episode I get to put a crown on him, maybe, or perhaps he chooses not to wear one anyways, I haven’t decided yet geez I just finished the last one, give me a break.</p>"

East is +20% GP generation, and west is trade routes giving +5% growth to cities they connect to (hard to do when there is open ocean that way).</p>"

  narration: "<p>It was cold, too cold, too deathly cold that one had to wonder how anyone could ever survive here much less thrive in such a place. Yet that’s what they were told to do, that’s what the orders were, that’s where their journey has taken them. To the top of the world, where their limbs freeze and their hands shake and their bones cry out in pain with every step. But every step is also a step towards greatness, for the homeland, for the people of the Tlingit. Every step further is another inch that they can use and no one else can. The land may seem useless, but the orders say, as they always do, that it is for the greater good, the future foreseen, the future desired. Freezing temperatures mean nothing in the face of the destiny of a nation. The shoulders of Gods hold them up, they will hold each other up too.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Bjarmians try yet again to get out of their self imposed prison that they created by not expanding. This time they attack the Kalmar Union (with the concept of support from Scythia), who are busy being distracted by the most engrossing game of football. I doubt they will be able to take Vassa, but you never know.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Maravi’s final neighbor bids Maravi “Hello” and “Goodbye”, choosing to send a settler guarded by a spearman as their choice of attack. Please don’t tell me this will somehow be a win for Maravi.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Jozef Poniatowski, the Polish general and Marshal of the French Empire under Napoleon, finds himself on the wrong side of Russia, well past where Moscow should be, and this time under the control of, well, I don’t think the Vyatkans are quite Russians? But they control Russia here so it is what it is. He’s been hired to try and help them fight the Kipchaks. They currently have a decent offensive heading towards Kanjak Sangir, and that city has very low strength given it’s up against comp bows. Maybe they can do it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I’m sorry Emerald I think Pegu just suck shit this game. They haven’t dealt a lick of damage to Geiju this time, somehow. They also have a settler heading down south, maybe to Sumatra? Anyways, Cebu settled in south Vietnam, finally getting themselves to three cities after only 90 turns. Why is the only civ we don’t see at all the only one here doing good (Lanfang). Like we’re just getting to watch a bunch of failures fuck around here, these guys suck. Sadly. I want them to do well. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Chineshisheliu looks to be much safer now that they have a comp bow clearing out the triremes and the unit next to the city is no longer there. Still solid chance it’ll fall given the 9 strength, but solid defending so far. Japan is having a hard time. So is Green Ukraine, who have moved that spearman one tile closer, but it still has to cross a river and a hill to get there, and who knows if the city will still be that deep red by the time they get there. </p>"

  narration: "<p>And so we end on the same continent that we started, Australia, with a shot of Hanga Roa about to be swallowed whole, NSW preparing to settle more, and Bunuba letting it all happen despite NSW still not having caught up in tech, no comp bows, no swordsmen.</p><p></p><p>Some quick catches on the minimap that were missed: Aures and Wassoulou settled in the western Sahara, Portugal settled Madrid, and Guaycuru got another on the coast. Also it was shown but I didn’t say specifically but the Kipchaks got three settles down at some point and Vyatka two.</p><p></p><p>I, Orangechrisy, have been your host for today, it is 7pm Saturday, I feel like there should be a few more narrative bits though can’t figure out where to put them, but otherwise have rushed through this in mostly one go cause I decided I wanted to do a game jam with some friends starting tomorrow. I hope you all enjoyed, go support Pomo, and Coiot can’t silence me :3</p>"
