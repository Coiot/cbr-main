  narration: "<p>We open this episode on Western North America, where the Pomo have established quite a decent core for themselves. They’re not nearly done either, with two more settlers out looking for spots to weave their baskets. </p><p></p><p>The Ponca, over on the other side of the Rockies, seem much less inclined to peaceful expansion. If they were to point their formidable army at one of their neighbour’s exposed cities, they might be able to snag some land, but for now White Eagle seems more interested in defending his fortress city Wáin-Xude and rearing the absolute horde of bison in his territory.</p>"

  narration: "<p>From their outpost in Hanga Roa, the Rapa Nuians look on in awe as a massive Bunuba army wielding the latest technology starts attacking the city of Launceston. “Sharp metal sticks instead of blunt wooden ones! What kind of person could have thought of that?” one of them remarks. “If I had known this continent was full of bloodthirsty geniuses, I would never have come here,” another adds.</p><p></p><p>Up on the North-East coast, two settlers belonging to the warring nations engage in a staring contest.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Spearthrower Owl has recruited William Morton hoping he could help build some grand temple or palace, some piece of architecture that could awe foreign dignitaries and his own populace both. Maybe he should have read the man’s resume a little closer, as Morton showed up to the first day on the job with a canister of strange gas, looking for rotting teeth. Let’s hope the first man to use anesthetics for dental surgery doesn’t put Teotihuacan to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Unless you’re a fan of Karankawa of course.</p>"

  narration: "<p>War! Vlad decides the citizens of Sidon look like they could use a good staking, and declares war on Phoenicia. Only, he seems to have forgotten to notify his army, which is still stationed around his capital. Since they are also still at war with Scythia, I don’t see this going well for either civ involved, both of them now in a two-front war.</p><p></p><p>Also in this slide: the Circassians still don’t seem to know what to do with all the settlers they trained, and we get a look at the Phoenician’s unique Trireme, the Bireme.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Up in Scandinavia the Bjarmian assault falls prey to the computer’s well-known inability to focus: if only they committed their full army on either Narva or Pärnu, they would surely be able to take it. As it is now, however, it seems like this assault has very little chance of succeeding.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>If one thing can be said about Hiram I, it’s that he’s ambitious. In a game like this, where big swings lead to big rewards more often than not, that is often a good thing. But when you are already in a two-front war in the Middle East, that ambition may be closer to a deathwish. Now neither he nor his Sumerian opposition have much of an army ready on the front lines, but keeping on the good side of at least some of your neighbours when your empire is mostly indefensible desert seems prudent. Especially when just last turn you were fighting the same enemy.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Now this is how you do a war declaration! Hiram and Vlad should take notes. Sho Shin declares war on Japan, and instantly a fleet of triremes surround Momoyama. The Japanese fleet is a few turns away, so the city has a good chance of falling to Ryukyu quickly- Sho Shin only has to seal the deal. </p><p></p><p>There are also a few unguarded Japanese settlers floating around. An enterprising trireme captain may have the chance to grant their lord a great gift…</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Pegu assault on Geiju is progressing steadily. At this rate, in only a turn or two the city will fall. Maybe that will convince Shin Sawbu to start expanding some more? Her closest rival Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is spreading his lovely green-and-orange colour scheme all over the place, while Pegu is left in the dust with a mere two cities. Not like Yunnan is doing much better on that front, but at least they have some settlers heading out to places they can actually place cities.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tired of leading his horses through the dense jungles, Eso decides to give up on attacking the Xavante and instead focus on domestic matters. His people have recently settled their third city, and he is sure no civilization could come close to rivaling his own. “Yes, surely it is time to sit back and enjoy these gains,”he thinks. “Or maybe I should prepare to send my entire army even further away?”</p>"

  narration: "<p>We get a look at the Seychelles heartland- or heartsea really. Some very large cities, some newer additions, and overall what looks like a thriving empire. It may be hard for them to break into Africa, with the Maravi clinging to the coastline, but if they can build up their core on Madagascar and the Horn they might just be able to surprise.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Tang are at war with Rouran and Yunnan, but you wouldn’t be able to tell from this slide. Sure, they may be entering a Dark Age, but they have a strong core and a formidable army, with plenty of room for expansion left. It’s still very early in the game, but if they keep up I can see them becoming quite the regional powerhouse. </p><p></p><p>(Also, don’t mind the notification bar, I promise we get there)</p>"

  narration: "<p>Julius II dons his cheddar armor, puts on his brie helmet, and unsheathes his gouda sword. The Phoenician Biremes have sailed the waters near Ascoli for too long, spreading lactose-intolerant lies against the Faith and altogether being nuisances. It’s a fondue crusade against Hiram, who is running out of neighbours he is not at war with.</p><p></p><p>Despite Julius’s proud declaration, it’s unlikely anything will come from it- much like most of the real-life crusades.</p>"

Lee taps his forehead. “Last time I got beaten by those guys from the North, so if I work for the Northernmost guys I can find, I’m sure to win!” </p><p></p><p>The Ket certainly love their ice and snow, and as their pantheon gives them faith and culture from snow they can actually make some use of it. Now if only Olgit could get over his aversion for defrosted land, he might be able to keep up with his neighbours. They won’t stay as far away as they are forever, after all…</p>"

They’ve got three settlers out in the snowy wastes already. Breaking out of Kamchatka isn’t easy, but the Itelmen are making a good effort. Could they be the true heirs to the Chukchi? </p><p></p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene20.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Pakistan and Mysore are at peace without any exchange of territory. Pakistan is running out of room quickly, with all their neighbours encroaching on their territory. They do have the first composite bowmen we have seen, so if they can press this advantage quickly they may still be in the game. The window of opportunity will close soon though, but at this point there is still everything to play for in this region.</p><p></p><p>Over on the notification bar, Joao has found Prester John to his great joy, and Hiram managed to tick off one of the enemies on his hit list. Speaking of which…</p>"

  scene_title: "So this is what war is good for?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene21.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Poor, poor Ma’in. At this point I think it is fair to say their game is as good as over. Hiram comes out of this war with not only the two cities he took, but also a free city on top from the peace deal. Looking at the armies, or lack of them, Yathill was never in danger of falling, so he should count himself lucky. Now he has the chance to focus on the bevy of wars he’s still embroiled in, and consolidate his gains. While Phoenicia is performing impressively so far, let’s not forget they are still in the Middle East, surrounded by unfriendly neighbours, and severely lacking in clear expansion routes. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Capac orders his men into linear formation. “If we all stand in a line within sight of the city walls, they will surely surrender out of fear!” Davi Kopenawa is unimpressed by the show of force, and responds with his own mind games: “if we have no military, they will believe we have forces they cannot see!” </p><p></p><p>The Xavante settlers, meanwhile, wander the jungle looking for the perfect place to found a city. They have only two criteria: it must be overgrown and impossible to invade. </p>"

  narration: "<p>After a somewhat slow start, Luba is recovering somewhat, and have staked their claim on the Congo basin. Them, Maravi, and Herero are looking fairly equal in terms of infoaddict score now. Will one of them overtake the others and become the undisputed master of Southern Africa? Or will they keep each other in balance, crab-bucket style, for an outside power to swoop in and pick them apart later? Ethiopia up North is starting to look scary…</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, that’s quite an army you’ve got up there, Zara Yaqob. Is that all for Amina?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Jozef Poniatowski can’t help but feel uncomfortable in the lands of his Vyatkan employers. He has the strange feeling like more of this place should be on fire somehow. Indeed, in a more spherical world, he was commander of the Polish army under Napoleon during his Russian campaign. Jozef keeps his strange feelings to himself, though he does complain about the cold to anyone who will listen. </p><p></p><p>The western steppes are getting crowded quickly, and a convoy of Estonian and Scythian settlers will only fill up the area more. Vyatka looks like the top dog around here for now, but not by such a margin that they can just coast to regional domination. Ioann Anikiev Myshkin is going to have to put in some more effort to keep his position here.</p>"

  scene_title: "I’m disappointed in everyone in this slide honestly"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>All those good things I said earlier about Tang don’t matter much if they can’t project that power. You might be top in the infoaddict rankings, with a solid core of cities and room for more, as well as a formidable army, but if you let little three-city Yunnan besiege your cities you’re going to have a hard time earning anyone’s respect. While I respect Long Yun’s initiative here, it still seems doomed to fail. Those units would probably be more useful to break Pegu’s siege of Geiju, or maybe to snag Tang’s more vulnerable outpost of Zhengzhou.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Pegu, their settler seems to have heard of the Rapa Nui settler’s voyage, and has gotten inspired. Did something go wrong in earlygame unit orientation, and were all the people who wanted to be scouts pointed at the settler course instead?</p><p></p><p>In the very corner we can see Ryukyu’s assault on Japan has not yet resulted in a city capture. I had such high hopes for these guys too…</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene26.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Like Phoenicia, Zazzau is at war with most of its neighbours. Unlike Phoenicia, their neighbours have armies. The peace treaty with Wassoulou only marginally improves Amina’s situation: Ethiopia’s army is even larger than it looked like a few slides back, Luba looks ready to capture their settler or the city it might found, and the Aures are getting all up in their business on their Western border. It’s not looking life-threatening quite yet, but it will take some clever diplomacy for Amina to get out of this situation without losing any more than she already has.</p><p></p>"

  narration: "<p>I swear this isn’t the same slide we saw before, Jandamarra’s assault is just stalled out for… very good reasons I’m sure. He’s arrayed his army in Caral Linear Formation, waiting for John Macarthur to maneuver his defensive army into position. Maybe he’s upset about his settler losing the East Australian Staring Contest?</p><p></p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene28.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We saw them a couple slides ago, but here we get a close look at the Scythian unique unit: the Gorytos Archer. This chariot archer replacement starts with a free promotion and some more power. It’s a strong unit, and Ateas should make use of them quickly. He is already at war with Vyatka and Wallachia, either of which would make excellent target practice.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As if he heard me just now, Ateas declares war… on Sumeria. So close.</p><p></p><p>Down in South America, the Potiguara are becoming one of the region’s powerhouses. While the Xavante settlers still have not found their perfect settling places, Felipe Camarao gets the chance to box them in from the East. That’s not to say they are completely safe: if Guaycuru were to turn that enormous army on them, Catu and Jacu could flip before you could say ‘shrimp’.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene30.jpeg
  narration: "<p>While the Ryukyu have managed to bring Momoyama down to the yellow, the Japanese fleet has arrived quicker than expected and broken the siege. Sho Shin blames the failed assault on his advisors and generals, and decides he should be the only one calling the shots. Ryukyu is now officially a monarchy. </p><p></p><p>While Ryukyu had a flying start, they have stalled out since. With Japan and the Tang expanding in their direction, opportunistic plays like this one seem the best way for them to break out- provided they succeed of course. </p>"

  scene_title: "I should be more careful what I wish for"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene31.jpeg
  narration: "<p>I was hoping Ryukyu would continue making aggressive plays, but I did not expect them to dump a city right on Lanfang’s home island of Borneo. While this colony seems undefendable and destined to be eaten by Lanfang almost immediately… well, it probably is. But I really do appreciate Sho Shin making these big swings.</p><p></p><p>Lanfang itself is looking in great shape. With four rapidly growing cities and two more on the way, Luo Fangbo has no real rivals in his vicinity. His triremes are still harassing Ternate too, ostensibly just for shits and giggles.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zara Yaqob’s coronation as Prince gives us a reason to take a look at the Ethiopian heartlands. The land here is swarmed by builders and little else, though the terrain looks like it will be even more productive once the infrastructure has all been built. The Ethiopian army in their expedition to Zazzau has hit an impassable barrier in lake Tchad. Looks like Amina can breathe a small sigh of relief for now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Observant viewers might have spotted it already, but Pegu and Yunnan have made peace. Shin Sawbu really dropped the ball here; by all accounts, she should have been able to take Geiju. Yunnan, on the other hand, now has a chance to construct a bit of a core down in Indochina, a region that Pegu would otherwise have been free to claim.</p><p></p><p>The Pegu settler heading North has left Bangladeshi lands in search of something grander. The North pole perhaps? Vyatka is a long way away still…</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season5-episode4-scene35.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Impressed by the throngs of people in Huaracanga, the believers of Pachaism believe proper worship may only come from cities that are sufficiently large. Such crowds must also come with places to house them, so Caral came up with Madrassas- like the Mosques they had already, but you get smarter and more cultured in them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Circassia attempts to escape the Scythian Squeezebox to their North by expanding into the Caucasus and the Middle East. Most of their neighbours are at war with each other, so they have a chance here to build up a bit. The good news is that they are no longer stuck on the shores of the Black Sea; the bad news is that they are now stuck in the Caucasus and the Middle East.

Will he send his horse archers against Circassia or Estonia, whose lands look lightly defended and ripe for the taking? Will he send his settlers to the fertile and unclaimed lands of central Europe?

He is always away on the front lines of some war, only occasionally returning to Tyre with the spoils of war from his conquests, and tales told by his soldiers how he fearlessly trades with the nations around him: their treasures for their lives. They call him Hiram I the Brave, and cheer when he parades through the streets of the Phoenician capital.</p><p></p><p>Yeah, a guy who keeps picking fights with all his neighbours at the same time can certainly be called brave.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Qara-Khitai is still at war with the Kipchaks, though his army is hesitant to approach the enemy. I can’t blame them, that firing squad of archers certainly looks daunting. Yelu Dashi has recently doubled the amount of cities under his control, with the addition of Chachi and Almalïq, though his core is still looking quite sparse. Out here on the steppe there is no room for mediocrity or stagnation; if you do not claim the lands around you, one of your neighbours will- and then your own lands too.</p>"

They are clearly outmatched by most of their neighbours, but they are making just the right plays to keep their heads above the water.</p><p></p><p>Bjarmia, on the other hand, I expected more of. If they prove unable to break through Estonia, they might just have to resign themselves to existence as a rump state on the icy top of the world.</p>"

All they know is that he is named Zeus, and that their warriors are filled with zeal and fervour just for knowing his statue sits there in his temple on the mountain. Isn’t that enough for worship, for faith?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The race for central Europe has begun in earnest. The Wallachians may have been the first to stake their claim with Turnu and Bucharest, but the Hanseatic League has for the first time left their shoreline to settle Kiel in these dark woods. Even the Pope has somehow found a way to get a settler past the Wallachian blockade. It is now wandering the land, looking for sheep or cattle to provide the milk for some exquisite cheeses. Further to the East, a Scythian settler prepares to settle an outpost right on Vlad’s doorstep.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Scythians and Estonians both had settlers right in the neighbourhood, but it’s Vyatka who wins the race to settle Shabalinskoe. Tough luck for Ateas and Lennart Meri; their settlers have to spend more time looking for room in the tundra which is really starting to fill up quickly. Even the Bjarmians have gotten a city up here. Imagine that! The Bjarmians!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Casimir Pulaski might be an expert in fighting from an underdog position- he fought for both Polish and American independence after all- but leading the Karankawa to victory might be too ambitious even for him. </p><p></p><p>Also, Teotihuacan and Ponca are at war now, I suppose. Don’t see that going anywhere, but I’ve been wrong before.</p>"

  narration: "<p>That Itelmen settler is very far from home. Perhaps here in the middle of Siberia he can finally rest, leave the incessant cawing of the crows behind. The neighbourhood here knows a thing or three about relaxation, at least: the Ket are having a very quiet game, slowly but steadily expanding through the tundra, while the Rouran don’t seem to care a whit even about their own cities. Maybe this is the exact kind of area that could use a far-flung colony to shake things up?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Vlad and Hiram kiss and make up, leaving behind Wallachia’s second least impactful war with a neighbour this episode. At least a farm got burned in this one. For Phoenicia, peace might be just what they need. They have had one hell of an early game, and the last thing they need now that they have gotten themselves something of a powerbase is a coalition war. Hiram should use this precious time to consolidate, recalibrate, get himself a bit of a unit carpet, and then carefully choose his next target. He’s a larger-than-average fish in a tiny pool right now, but the little guppies can still hurt him if they join forces.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Tlingit assault on Behe’pal is rebutted, but Sheiyksh’s choice of target speaks to his coast-hogging ambitions. He has recently gotten his hands on composite bowmen; perhaps round two of this attack will go his way. Essie Parrish better watch out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Herero and Luba make peace, unsurprisingly with no exchange of land. Jacob Morenga would be better served filling in the empty spaces in the South of Africa instead of repeatedly sending his nation’s young men to die in the jungles of the Congo. Knowing the AI though, we’ll see a third war with the exact same outcome soon enough.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And in our last slide of this episode, we get a look at the Kipchaks as they make peace with the Ket and with Qara-Khitai. Yelu Dashi gained nothing at all with his double-backstab maneuver, and probably lost a good chunk of his military along with the respect of his fellow leaders. Not a good look for him. This chunk of the steppe is swarming with settlers and Bactrian elephants, but we’ll have to wait until next week to get into that!</p>"
