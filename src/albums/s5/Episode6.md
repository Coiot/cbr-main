  narration: "<p>Hello fellow denizens of the Sub! I am Nirosat, and I will be narrating this week's episode. You might (though probably not) remember me from the last time I narrated in CBRX3 EP21, where I made a funny reference to Monty Python, and wore out everyone with jokes about Vermont. I do not play much Civ5, but I have been following (and lurking) the CBR for over 10 years now. Anyways, enough about me, lets get going!</p>"

  narration: "<p>We start off this episode’s actual slides with the ongoing conflict between the Kipchaks and their enemies, Bactria and Vyatka. Despite a pair of Elephantarch arriving to defend the city, Marakanda is in the red and in danger of falling. The rest of the Bactrian military remains around their other cities. Considering they are bankrupt, maybe they should use those units they are paying so much for. Vyatkan forces muster north of Kanjak Sangir, but have yet to advance upon the city. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Moving south we see the Sumer making moves on a relatively undefended Berytos. I’m not sure what the Phoenicians were thinking settling that city since it’s probably going to get captured…Or never mind. Tematekh gets a sultry call from his bedchambers and cancels the invasion. No sense to keep a missus waiting. Phoenicia shifts their attention to Ma’in who shifts uncomfortably waiting for a repeat beatdown.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It’s an ornate hall, fitting for a large empire. Complex patterns dance their way across the walls, their carvings embossed by the highlights and shadows of natural light. A handful of soldiers stand guard, the color of their standards as varied as the flowers on their flanks. In the room are two diplomats, deeply engaged in the eloquent sparring of their craft.“Please give us your cities,” one said, smiling.</p><p>The Bangladeshi diplomat couldn’t believe his ears. There was no reason to give the Tang more cities. But the man in front of him had an undeniable charm that made him want to agree with his terms. </p><p>“No,” he said shakily. He was explicitly told to not exchange cities. </p><p>“Pretty please?” Sweat broke out across the Bangladeshi’s body. How could this man have such a way with words!  He strained, eyes bulging, veins popping, breath haggard. </p><p></p><p>The Tang diplomat extended his hand. His opposite started to do the same before catching his wrist with the other arm. Must…resist… His whole form started shaking, his arms fighting one another to resist the deal. After several minutes of anguish, the man collapses onto the ground. With the last of his strength, he whispers… “No cities. Only Peace”.Bangladesh and Tang make peace with no cities exchanged. A Pegu settler explores east of Salem and a Bangladeshi one hikes through the Himilayas.</p>"

They lived a nomadic lifestyle for several millenia, travelled half the world over water and through desert, only to meet their end a few hundred years after settling.

They are well positioned to secure this deal with a flood of units in the English channel, though France has their own defense in the area.The hostile takeover of Dunder Mifflin looks to be complete as the companies’ productive capabilities are fully integrated. There is some resistance from disgruntled employees who are alienated by new corporate values regarding piracy. However, Grace assures them that things will be “business as usual” and that they are welcomed new members of the Umhaill family. </p>"

There is a great spot of real estate around Tennessee that has yet to be claimed and a Susquehannock settler is nearby.</p><p></p><p>Fun fact, the Susquehannock are one of the Civs I root for. But only because there was once a pro Rocket League team called the Susquehannock Soniqs. What’s the most ‘off the cuff’ reason you’ve cheered for a Civ?</p>"

In their disgust the defense of the city is abandoned and it falls to Green Ukraine. Since Chineshisheliu is not on a river, they push back Japan’s advance. </p><p></p><p>One must wonder what happens when they realize Tigil is on a river… It’s not like they can just take backsies the settle. </p>"

NSW has more cities and higher production, Bunubo has the more advanced military and higher effective science. Even these differences are very slight, so in my eyes it's a very even matchup.Uluru is still unclaimed. Will that NSW settler be the first?</p>"

A nation rattled to their nonexistent core, Rapa Nui restructures their government into a principality under Prince Hotu Matu'a. This way they have a central source of authority to bind their scattered people together. </p><p></p><p>His first act…to spread the teachings of Puata Tupuna throughout Australia and New Guinea. Surely followers of the same faith will be peaceful with one another.</p><p></p><p>A lone settler sits at the center of New Guinea. “Is this a good place? I sure like it.

Meanwhile, the Umhaill Co. acquisition of Le Havre-Mart hasn’t made much progress. Nadezhda Durova was a Russian cavalry soldier who fought in the Napoleonic Wars. Born female, Nadezhda dressed as a man and went by the name Aleksandr Aleksandrov during their military career. After their service, they continued dressing and living as a man, leading to debate among historians on this historic figure’s gender identity. </p>"

An Ethiopian settler tucks itself behind a spearman for protection deep within Maravi’s zone of influence.</p><p></p><p>Maravi is currently at war with all of their neighbors: Ethiopia, Herero, Luba, and Seychelles. The only exception is Ma’in, though they wouldn’t make any difference. It will be a tall ask for them to come out of this unscathed, though natural barriers may assist them as much as their military. </p><p></p><p>Up north we can see Phoenician ships assault Nashaq. While they will probably fall short of taking the city, I do like Phoenicia’s bold moves in this battle royale. </p>"

There are plenty of melee units abound so this has the chance to flip again. I believe this might be our first multi-flip city.

From the looks of this slide, it looks like the Tang are going for another diplomatic conquest instead of using their military. Lanfang is probably going to grab the isolated Ryukyu city in Indonesia. Rouran troops trickle across Tang’s northern border on a yet to be disclosed mission.  </p>"

They immediately crash down upon the city which will surely fall in the next turn or two. The Pegu boats a settler to an island now that they missed the boat for settling in their own backyard. Sigh</p><p>Ma’in realizes they were missing out on the We Hate Maravi Party and decides to invite themselves. The current members look at each other as though wondering “why is he here?”</p>"

Yanomami seems a bit sparse on the military front, but at this stage city exchanges are still rare in the Amazon. They have two settlers heading into unclaimed regions of the Caribbean.</p><p></p><p>The Xavante looks to be an impossible nut to crack with a carpet of military units combined with an already unnavigable jungle. Their settlers, meanwhile, continue to mill about the rainforest, surely regretting their earlier lackadaisical methods for city location appropriation. Now they can only lament their choices, realizing that they would be of more use as a banana. </p>"

But now he needed to do more, something even grander…</p><p></p><p>Wallachia citizens were a bit confused when the decrees were made. Food was to be distributed among the populace for no cost? But it was true. The carts, laden with meals, were provided. All proclaimed how kind and altruistic their leader was, unaware of the slow uptick in missing peoples. Whispers of something in the night that lingers in the corner of your eye. Freezes the air around you and makes your skin crawl. A black hole that captures happiness and joy on an event horizon and crushes them into the void. And the eternity one sees as they fall in only contains the remaining terror and despair.
