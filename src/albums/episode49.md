  narration: "<p>My apologies for the lateness of the hour. Proper social graces can be most difficult to observe during wartime. I’m /u/EndlessVoid0, and I do stuff, occasionally, I guess. As a former and probably-still-current lurker, it’s kind of scary, at times? Whatever. We’ve got a good part ahead of you. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Another week, another fantastic piece of original content. /u/ARedundantSofa detailed the probable thought process behind Parthia’s suicide run with this lovely treat for our eyes, though I can’t help but feel like the artist is perhaps downplaying the Kazakhs’ power here. I don’t know, it just feels a little… wrong, seeing them as an actually physical being and not some omnipresent force.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ever wonder what Uruguay’s cursed face would look like on the flags of the cylinder? Ponder no longer with Sebscobar’s collection of occupied territory flags, with both Kazakh and Uruguayan editions out as I write this. This one’s the flag of Uruguayan Papua, a beautiful piece of work that incorporates both good aesthetic design and the face that I’ve had taped to my eyelids for the past few months.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And finally, for those of you just looking to quantify the scale of the cylinder, Vihreaa’s hand-drawn maps consistently provide that refreshing sense of awe, pride, and “Jesus, I really wasn’t as emotionally prepared for so little Palmyra as I thought” that accompanies the best kinds of OC. Never before have we seen so many city-states and so few powers. If the rate of culling we’ve been seeing continues, we might never see the likes of it again.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah, the Power Rankings. Kazakh first place is a take, and I say that being one of the ones who put them there. But even with their being coalitioned by two of the strongest civs in the game, they’re still just about stalemating, and they’re not even at full strength yet. If you’re looking for someone to support who’s not going to let you down, Ablai Khan’s as good a pick as any.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Today’s part starts out with a view of the Zimbabwe/Taungoo war, and, well, you sure can’t say that Bayinnaung is just rolling over and accepting his fate. Bago’s flipped back and might just stay that way, but there’s a lot of Zimbabwean units lurking on the edge of this shot, and not a whole lot of Taungoo units to compensate. They might be able to hold out for a few turns, but it’s only a matter of time before they buckle under the pressure only a superpower can exert.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, in Acarigua, the worst has finally come to pass: Hugo Chavez has died as he lived, stubbornly fighting a losing war against an existential threat. Sure, the Taungoo are probably a good deal weaker than Uruguay right now, but the story’s remained the same for him nonetheless; he clung to life as long as he could, but was eventually overwhelmed by sheer numbers. If it’s any solace for Venezuela fans, consider this; it took the combined power of three of the best six civs on the cylinder to bring him down, and even then he still held out a surprisingly long time. Maybe Venezuela was never meant to be a power in either America, but if there’s anyone that could be a worthy successor to the Buccs in Central America, it’s Hugo Chavez.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the deepest, darkest regions of South America, alone in a heavily reinforced bunker miles underneath the cylinder’s surface, Juan Antonio Lavalleja twists the cap off of his favorite red marker and defaces a portrait of happier days.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Bering Sea’s really outdone itself when it comes to providing intra-continent conflicts this mark, and this current war is no different. The Iroquois, despite being hilariously outnumbered, have managed to push all the way into Japan thanks to their tech advantage and the element of surprise, but with a Kazakh helicopter fleet that’s that big, one can’t help but wonder how long it will take for this offensive war to become a defensive one.</p>"

  scene_title: "Blood in the Water"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Taungoo’s mission to rid the world of rump states in the east has been a wild success, on the west things are going far less smoothly. Bago’s continued freedom has come at the cost of Sagaing and Inwa to the south, and while there are enough Taungoo troops in range to keep the cities flipping, there aren’t enough to keep them under the brown and black banner indefinitely. If it wasn’t guaranteed already, it sure is now; Taungoo isn’t coming out of this war with more cities than they came into it. All they can do now is pray that they’re able to mitigate the damage.</p>"

  scene_title: "Setting"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now, sure, Uruguay’s carpet looks imposing, on the surface. But then you take a closer look, and, hey, are those lancers? Line infantry? Lavalleja may be strong on his own continent, but if he wants to project his power such that he can actually win his current war against a fellow superpower he’s got quite the science deficit to make up.</p>"

  scene_title: "Kill or Spare"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>As Zimbabwe and Taungoo continue to battle amidst the rapidly decomposing ruins of Indochina, some other corner of the world, one we’d thought already decided, deigns to speak its mind. For, you see, Alaric, being an absolute master of surviving situations he has no business surviving, has somehow managed to buy a reprieve from the Moorish menace, with a little help from a few Taungoo diplomats who are in for a nasty shock once they head back home. One can only wonder what the Goths had to pay to make that peace deal a reality.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Round and Round"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>By the looks of it, the Iroquois could use a little of that good old-fashioned Gothic diplomatic genius too. The Kazakhs are turning the tables on this war like an experienced DJ, taking advantage of the lacking Iroquois military presence in the region to seize Tosa-Aki and Imabari. The helicopters currently descending upon Alaska may just get themselves canonized as part of the eleventh Biblical plague, but they aren’t going to be doing much city taking, being ranged units. Not that that’s even going to matter, necessarily: they’ll likely busy themselves with killing off Iroquois units first, and given how few Hiawatha has...</p>"

  scene_title: "There was an Attempt"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Never let it be said that the Great Kazakh Cudgeling is solely composed of miracle Iroquois gains and hilarious Parthian idiocy. See, the Uruguay are a part of this war too! Look, they’ve actually managed to take Dianjiang! At the cost of the entire rest of their Pacific empire’s city health, sure, but they are trying their best. The issue for them right now isn’t related to the effort that they’re putting in so much as it is the growing realization that Uruguay’s best might, for the first time this mark, not be good enough.</p>"

  scene_title: "Verdant Triumphant"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>A few turns later, and outside of the standard set of flips that are beginning to choke the strait outside Sagaing with corpses, nothing’s really changed for the Taungoo. Which, of course, only makes their situation more dire. Bago’s falling again is the centerpiece of this slide, but there’s something far, far worse brewing for Bayinnaung here. See those Zimbabwean melee units outside Allahabad? See how close they are to that city?</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Nutcracker"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yeah. Taungoo might be able to hold off a naval invasion by Zimbabwe to some extent, but a serious land invasion would be too much for any of the non-powers to overcome. And Taungoo? Is not a power. If they keep their attention as focused to the south as it currently is, they might just not have cities pretty soon. And even if they do manage to hold back the green goons for a little while longer, it’s only a matter of time before the soap bubble that is their empire pops.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Just Testing the Waters"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>In Britain, though, a far greater battle is brewing, as two scientific powerhouses settle their differences the only way they know how: by erecting ever-more-ridiculous structures in a ridiculous game of one-upmanship. The Moors strike first, and might just clinch an edge in wonders right then and there, constructing the Enrichment Center in what I can only assume is a half-decent city for it. GLaDOS’ playpen provides one additional science for each citizen in the city, a lethal combination in a good settlement and a waste of a wonder in a failed Petra city. Still, given how close the two empires are in science right now, clear human rights violations such as this one could make all the difference.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Kill, Evidently"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Taungoo’s slow, painful, protracted fall from grace continues, a somehow even more slow-cooking standoff has just been heated up by about, oh, one tenth of a degree. Eadni, having just made peace with the Goths, teams up with her old buddy Ewuare (?) to declare war on the Parthians, with neither party evidently aware that Mithridates’ one remaining city is protected by an Indian comp bow who absolutely refuses to budge. Alaric’s not going to complain, though. Anything that keeps the tattered remains of his empire alive a little while longer is good in his book.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "It Nepal Falls Down"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Having successfully gained control of these former “Nepalese” lands and uncovered the scroll of effective city defense from its location in Prithvi Narayan’s tomb, Mutota marshals his singular AA gun in the region to the main Taungoo front, drooling in anticipation at the prospect of ridding them of an air force. To be fair, if they do have one, it’s probably already in disarray, given how frequently Bayinnaung has been moving back and forth between his ostensible capital and whichever other city he’s foisted himself upon.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Duelling on the Ocean’s Surface"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>War! And it’s between two superpowers, so you know it’s going to be good. Also, damn, forgot how small the Atlantic is on this map. The Moors haven’t, though, and with that kind of navy they stand a serious chance of making landfall onto South America if all goes right, and if they manage to not immediately lose cities in North Africa to that token force there. They’re two whole eras ahead of Uruguay in some places. It’s kind of terrifying, and if you’re Lavalleja is probably a big hit to the ol’ ego. Still, though, I can’t help but feel like this screenshot has a bit too much going on...</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Polluting the Ocean’s Floor"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Much better. Two turns later, and all the units are dead, and the Moors have, hilariously, slipped into Las Piedras while nobody was looking. After an opening salvo like this the Moors are probably not going to be taking that much, but Abd-ar Rahman III is going to be a hell of a nuisance for the cylinder’s own Hannibal Lecter, and giving how the Kazakh war is on a knife’s edge it might just slam Uruguay’s window shut for good.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Downhill from Here"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turns out, all Zimbabwe needed the whole time was a few slides’ worth of time out of the limelight. Who knew? With the fall of Gorkha and the near-levelling of Bhamo, not only has the coastline been all but secured, but the army proper is finally making inroads into Taungoo territory. And it’s not hard to see why: while Taungoo’s south might be well-populated, their north is barren, and their production numbers weren’t enough to hold the line against the full brunt of Zimbabwe’s forces on their own. Bayinnaung’s probably still going to be alive after this part, but any hope of him making an actual imprint on this game has gone completely out the window.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Spainish Revenge"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the Atlantic, Las Piedras is traded for Barinas and Santa Teresa Del Tuy. If you’re an Uruguay fan and you like suffering, try comparing the two civs’ navies in this screenshot. Lavalleja, likely at this point drowning his sorrows and wondering when his invulnerability wore off, is employing a token defense force largely comprised of embarked units and privateers. Abd-ar Rahman, meanwhile, has only a few land units in sight, is many, many techs ahead, and most importantly, is using his massive navy, slowly and inexorably moving it to the front. Uruguay may be keeping even on this front for now, but if they don’t want to fall victim to the same fate they subjected Australia to they’re running out of time.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the sidebar, terrible, terrible things are happening. Parthia has made peace with the Kazakhs, and thus, thanks to the heroic efforts of one Indian composite bowman, has been spared. Truly, this is the darkest timeline.</p>"

  scene_title: "Overextension"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Porlamar falls the next turn, but the warm, fuzzy, pleasant feeling that accompanies news of Uruguay being humiliated isn’t quite enough to wash the bitter taste of that last peace deal away. If this is how Parthia makes it to the end of the game, was it ever really worth it in the first place?</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "The Power of Diplomacy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The most humiliating part of this: in those final days, Parthia was protected not by the composite bowman of legend, but by the untimely teleportation of that one Indian settler. I feel sick. I’m sure Ablai Khan, who bombed Zadracarta into oblivion and knocked at its gates for dozens of turns, feels immeasurably worse.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Needs More Green"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>And yep, Taungoo’s in wholesale collapse now. Bhamo, Bago, and Sagaing all join Gorkha in what is fast becoming Bayinnaung’s elevator pitch to the Order of Rumps, as Zimbabwe doesn’t quite sweep across the landscape so much as lazily poke at it. Taungoo might be able to flip one or two of these cities if things really break their way, but their chances of getting out of this with some manner of dignity left without a prompt peace deal are near nil, and the slowly-advancing green wave in Allahabad has essentially put a timer on the remainder of their stay in mainland Asia. They need their diplomats to come through, and they need them to come through now.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Not Their Intended Purpose"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Uruguay’s finally gotten their turn at the wheel and has used it to seize the only two Moorish cities they could realistically take. Though their chosen units for those endeavors do seem to be leaving a lot to be desired. Enlightenment era horses are all well and good in the era they’re made, and still serve a purpose on land, but on sea and against units that hopelessly outclass them they become considerably less effective.</p><p></p><p>Though, you never really know with the CBR. Sometimes, a force of wildly outdated embarked units is the best navy a country can have.</p>"

  scene_title: "Lunar Conquest"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Dagon goes green thanks to the efforts of a bored AA gun operator, but look! Over to the right! It’s the Kazakh-Uruguay war! And it remains as stubborn a testament to the adverse effects of meleeitis as ever. Just think: if Ablai Khan hadn’t built his army out of the most omnidirectional vehicles he could find, he’d probably have claimed the entirety of this theater by now. As it is, Uruguay stands a startlingly good chance of winning this war handily, and the big bad Khan has only himself to blame.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps to vent his frustrations, he proves that the Kazakhs can, in fact, into space. I wonder if they know that cheese is a low-potassium food?</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "The Forest’s Looking Real Big Today"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pyay is the next Taungoo city to fall to the executioner’s axe, and while it will almost certainly flip back, it represents a crushing blow for Bayinnaung nonetheless. Now the city that’s the namesake of his empire, the metropolis of Taungoo itself, is on the front lines, and boy, is it going to be tough explaining that one at the United Nations.</p><p></p><p>I think there’s a phrase for what’s happening on the sidebar. “Crushing disappointment” sounds apt.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Blood Demanded, not Received"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Perhaps realizing that despite his overwhelming technological advantage his chances of seizing any more than like three cities were infinitesimal, Abd-ar Rahman makes peace with Lavalleja. It’s a questionable move on the part of the Moors, but a lucky escape for Uruguay, who despite being thoroughly humbled in terms of tech and having their veneer of invulnerability now get a chance to restock in preparation for hostilities to come at full strength.</p>"

The war with the Kazakhs is bleeding them dry, but they’re still in good shape, with plenty of high pop cities and—wait, is that fallout</p><p>Ah</p><p>Well</p><p>I mean, if you want to make more mutants, that’s a pretty surefire way of doing it</p><p>Excuse me, just give me a moment</p><p>Hold on</p><p></p><p>Well that one guy who predicted it’d be dropped over Japan is probably pretty disappointed</p>"

  narration: "<p>In mildly less batshit news, the Kazakhs’ counterpush has allowed them to once more make landfall on North America. It’s not that good of a counterpush, admittedly, with Iyo-Saijo and Cev’aq likely to be the extent of their ambitions for now, and given how Ablai Khan has 229 shots of the nuclear cannon to go and how eager he seems to be to use it, tech inferiority and stupid levels of city spam might not even matter once he gets a head of steam going.</p><p></p><p>the f*ing kazakhs, man</p>"

  scene_title: "Negative Tint"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh, would you look at that, things somehow got even worse. One turn later and the Zimbabwean horde has officially arrived, but not before letting a single anti-aircraft gun seize Taungoo’s namesake city under heavy fire and under Uruguay’s peacekeepers’ noses. The majority of Taungoo’s units in this screenshot are carriers without planes or submarines, and given their rapidly-filling land, they might not even have enough space to put their units places when they produce them.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Hiawatha, rightfully intimidated by Ablai Khan’s willingness to drop nukes on cities that aren’t even that important, sues for peace with the Kazakhs. When asked to weigh in on Khan’s actions from his wine cellar, Lavalleja states simply “Dude, even I’m not that evil.”</p>"

  scene_title: "Divided, Alaska Falls"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sukumo would be a hell of a problem for mapmakers, but given that it’s in the ocean, I’m pretty sure it’s out of Vihreaa’s jurisdiction. If Ablai Khan decides to renew his commitment to murdering the Iroquois in the near future, however, it’s certainly not going to be any safer than the currently besieged Uruguayan city of Ninstints is, or, hell, the entire rest of Alaska. This war may go down in the books as a win for Hiawatha, yes, but it could have gone so much better.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Queen Bee’s New Coat"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pyay is the next city to fall to the Zimbabweans, and it’s not flipping back, despite those great peoples’ best wishes. The south is marginally more contested than the north, but any enthusiasm there fades at the sheer number of Uruguayan peacekeepers overrunning the remains of the Taungoo in this screenshot, trampling upon a grave that’s already been dug. Lavalleja wants to out-Madagascar Madagascar, and he’s goddamn committing to it.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ah. The UN."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Seriously. God. Damn. Taungoo seems doomed to go out not with a bang but a whimper, slowly worn down under the weight of a thousand Zimbabwean units, drowned by their own ostensible allies. And after their rapid takedown of all those Oceanian minnows back in the day? I cannot think of a more karmic end.</p><p></p><p>While this is going on, apparently still influenced mentally by the radiation emanating out of Battleford’s mountains, Hiawatha unveils Jurassic Park to the general public. The park provides your empire with a lot of extra gold, a lot of extra science, and dinosaur barbarians. Hell yes.</p>"

  scene_title: "I’m Sure Ablai will Learn Eventually"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yeah, that’s about what I expected here. Ninstints doesn’t look long for this world, and while it is for the moment merely an isolated colony of Uruguay’s that probably never was going to amount to all that much under than a nice and pretty extra number in the capitals column, it’s kind of illustrating a more troubling problem for Lavalleja right now. Namely, his status as the sole person fighting the Kazakhs right now after a war with the Moors that was more like a vaudeville sideshow. Nukes are a start, but he’s still wildly out-teched, and if something doesn’t change soon he’ll start losing city after city.</p><p></p><p>While this is going on, the Kazakhs elect to make peace with the Vikings, in a move that is little more than just good political hygiene for Ablai Khan and quite the relief for a Viking nation increasingly worried about weird men backed up by poofy clouds landing out of the sky and killing city-states with ease.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode49-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Against a backdrop of slow, gradual Taungoo destruction, Uruguay pushes about as far as they’re going to get and slides into Luoyang. They are doing pretty well right now, yes, but their units are horribly, horribly outdated, and the Kazakhs’ are much deadlier, and have more friends. A quick peace deal a la the Moorish war would be very, very prudent for Lavalleja right now.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Iroquois seize the lead in the building silly buildings competition with the completion of the Shanghai Financial Center, a building which gives flat gold and improves merchants, which makes it kinda nice for humans and pretty useless for the AI. Still, you can never have too much gold, I suppose.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In Arheimar, local buffoon Alaric was found dead in his own home yesterday, shot twice in the back then left to rot in a pool of blood. Alaric had been known as a pillar of the community for quite some time, owing to his previous conquests during his youth and his generous nature as he hit old age. A Beninese infantryman was found at the scene of the crime, and was summarily arrested for his involvement there. He faces first degree murder charges, but maintains that he did the old man a mercy, claiming that his last words were a pained cry of “I knew I shouldn’t have given you Gothiscandzia.” Those close to Alaric declined to comment.</p><p></p><p>(Also, the Iroquois built another wonder.

  narration: "<p>If Nyatsimba Mutota can’t slide into Mottama normally, then he’s just going to have to go around. Deftly dodging peacekeepers like a Matrix character, Zimbabwe’s units seize Adelaide, Pathein, and Queanbeyan with little fanfare and even less native resistance, as their main enemy becomes not the dying forces of the Taungoo but the roadblocking Uruguayan units stubbornly intent on keep Bayinnaung hooked up to the life support. A few more turns of this will probably give Zimbabwe those cities anyways, but when it comes to the Taungoo’s efforts to broker a peace deal this sort of interference is just about the best thing to get for keeping that particular window open.</p><p></p><p>Hiawatha’s been especially industrious of late, building yet another wonder, with the Tokyo Sky Tree’s bonuses to happiness and culture all but making it official that he’s doing something with those Broadcast Towers. What, I don’t know, but he’s definitely doing something.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh, dear. What’s kicking a person while they’re down for 400? The Taungoo were already on the ropes before this, and I don’t quite see how Australia’s going to get themselves anything in the way of cities with this, but given how opportunistic their play has been of late I suppose this was just inevitable. Of more concern is the Parthian DoW in conjunction with theirs, something that’s going to have little to no effect right now but could perhaps prove fatal to the little purple empire if the Taungoo somehow survive this.

The Iroquois jump on the bandwagon and declare war on the Taungoo as well, a move that while smart in theory in practice entails surviving a full-on assault by those Taungoo troops still left in Hawaii first. They’ll probably crush the Taungoo rather easily if Bayinnaung splits his forces, but a coordinated assault could make things much harder, especially given the Uruguayan peacekeepers pouring into Hiawatha’s empire to gum up the works.

Sure, Bayinnaung’s empire may now be split into three separate chunks, but he’s alive, and given how devastating this war has been for him and his chances at doing just about anything in this game that’s something to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>In further news from the sidebar, Mithridates, aware of the fate of the Goths, starts cleaning up his mess diplomatically, and Ablai Khan throws the Hubble Space Telescope into space, providing his empire with a boost to science that should paper over the only flaw left in his game right now.

It’s probably not going to be a fatal one, but it might just set him back to boot: it’s unlikely Bayinnaung will actually flip Prince Albert or Saint-Louis de Langevin, but if he does that’s going to be a hit to population and production that can’t really be afforded right now if the Iroquois, like the Moors, are playing for a science victory.</p>"

Evidently Hiawatha did have something of a navy all along, because he’s torn through the Taungoo holdings in the region in only a few short turns, and now can rest easy knowing that he’s given the peacekeepers currently infiltrating his territory a bunch of nice, juicy ocean tiles to use in lieu of the land he actually likes. I don’t think that scheme is going to work out for him, but you do you, Hiawatha.</p><p></p><p>He also builds, you guessed it, another wonder. The Utsade Gene Vault boosts tile improvements that take a while to unlock in the first place, making it great for a country rebuilding after a war and merely mediocre for one that isn’t.

The Iroquois are on top tech-wise, the Moors a half-era down and the Kazakhs almost a full era behind. Those are your science victory contenders.

Puyang will probably flip back many times before the wave hits here, but the fact that it’s even flipping at all is more of an indictment of how Uruguay’s been playing this game than anything else. Their total ignorance of tech has led to their being totally outclassed in the region by the second-weakest superpower in that regard caught with their pants down.

They had some good wars against the Haida and the Apache, yes, but pre-Endgame they spent most of their time just resting on their laurels, and essentially gave the continent to Hiawatha for nothing through inaction despite an incredibly auspicious start. They came within centimeters of winning the continent in Endgame, after just the kind of strong strikes they were missing beforehand propelled them to a 1a 1b style situation with the Iroquois, but their inactivity during the early game proved too much to overcome, as Iroquois’ slim tech advantage ballooned into a large one and Louis Riel became the poster child for civs undone by poor tech.

Sure, Central America is smaller, but it’s a lot closer to their core, and much easier to reinforce in case things go as horribly wrong as they did last go round. He won’t be getting that much, here, but he’ll be getting something, and at this point he can’t afford to be picky about the details if he wants to win.</p><p></p><p>In Europe, as their principal enemies are distracted by actual war as opposed to passive-aggressive one-upmanship with wonders, the Moors create Hatsune Miku.

Those future worlds units’ nifty extra move is nice, yes, and is probably going to be the only thing keeping Hiawatha in the war a few from turns from now, his depopulated empire’s only counter to the blitz taking place.

But while the Inuit were able to clean house in North America, a Europe where most every civ was able to mount at least a token resistance proved unfailingly difficult for the Sami to break through, a problem that went from minor to major as, on the other end of the continent, the Moors grew ever more powerful through conquest rather than good settling. By the time Endgame hit, the Moors were the undisputed number one in the region while the Sami were never quite able to break out of their start, and after they had no choice but to run back their old strategy while the Moors reached new heights during Endgame, it became clear the Eadni’s goat was cooked.
