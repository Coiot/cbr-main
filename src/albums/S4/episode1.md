  narration: "<p>Happy Wednesday the 20th! Welcome back ladies and lads to the Civilization Battle Royale. We start off Season 4 following a stunning conclusion to Season 3 and what we hope was not a prolonged wait as we began to prepare what we hope is the best game yet. While it was not the most tiring development period, we still inevitably came across our fair share of headaches and hair pulling bugs that tested our patience. We are now on the other side of that struggle and are very happy to bring you all the most optimized and bug-free experience. </p><p></p><p>Special shoutout to Arilasqueto, who prepared for a new set of portraits for all the competitors. As the season continues, we’ll have each eliminated civ dimmed out until only one remains.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>FionaDanger / Lungora starts us off with the first map of the season with a stunning tile-accurate map including all the competitors’ starting location as well as a neat tribal designation to denote the starting game government status. Looking forward to seeing the map evolve and get filled out as empires rise and fall.</p>"

  narration: "<p>ECH has been running a popularity poll for this season’s competitors in the weeks leading up to today's release, culminating in one big final overall combined sheet. It is interesting to see who is getting all the attention and who is being looked past. Judging from the list, I expect much drama in the months ahead. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Power Rankers deliberated for a long time as we are going into no doubt the most balanced and well distributed roster we’ve had, but one civ is favored above the others —the Selkups. The Selkups enjoy the usual ranking boost being in the middle of Siberia, but this time around there is some competition in the northern regions of Eurasia that might not keep them as #1 for long. I don’t know how the team will rank in the episodes to come, but I expect fluctuations in ranks to come readily.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Time resets and we begin our journey anew in the sub at the dawn of history. We have some new accompaniment this time around, a lovely perimeter of mountains to ward off any undue shenanigans, as well as a more streamlined Observer interface. JFD has cooked up a big update to condense the Observer with key stats for random cities around the cylinder while on Babylon, but most importantly a new menu to observe large tile-accurate maps of the state of the cylinder which we will be showcasing throughout the season. A glimpse of those maps will have to wait until the action starts to heat up but is one of the big upgrades to highlight this season. For now let us go through a quick-fire overview of the competitors. Be sure to take notes as these names will be on the test… though actually no worries everyone will become familiar in just a few weeks and learning new history is a big part of the fun.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Faroes led by Trondur i Gotu are our first civ on the cylinder starting on the top left. Do not let their tame and humble appearance deceive you, these are the Vikings you have long awaited for. Fearsome and expansive, this is one of several of the island civs that you should look forward to seeing make landfall and making inroads wherever their boats may take them. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Down below are England led by Henry V, Burgundy led by Charles I, and Bavaria led by Ludwig II. It is essentially a classic England, France, and Germany face off and this time around each are tipped to be strong contenders if they can avoid each other for a little bit. That of course is impossible in crowded Europe but fans rooting for any of these are in for a treat.</p>"

  narration: "<p>To the east are Rome led by Trajan and Royal Hungary led by Elizabeth Báthory. Rome of course needs no introduction, and should be a non-encyclopedic follower of history to easily gravitate to. The Italian peninsula got a good buff this season, as you can probably notice by the increased girth. Royal Hungary is a new face, but Elizabeth Báthory is an infamous serial killer well known for her sadistic craving for young female blood in pursuit of her own vanity. This time around she might be going after everyone’s blood instead.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>Up north are Ume-Sámi led by Rijkuo-maja, the Finns led by Kirmukarmu, and Latvia led by Karlis Ulmanis. Ume-Sámi and the Finns might feel like familiar faces, as the Sámi were featured in Season One and of course Finnish representation is a near constant in the CBR. The left-field new challenger though is Latvia, having been favored over many other contenders in their voting region. The civs up north might have a semblance of a corner advantage, but it is Latvia the wildcard that I am looking forward to seeing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back west are the Visigoths led by Leovigild and the Alaouites led by Ismail ibn Sharif. We are used to quirky Iberian civs and so far from test games the Visigoths provide tons of fun making several fans in the pre-season. A surprise winner as well given the noise behind other civs in their voting block, the Visigoths have turned that shock around and have near universal hype coming into the season. The Alaouites are also a fan favorite, having missed out the previous season by the narrowest of margins in the vote. Ismail ibn Sharif is a beast, to say the least, and the IRL father of hundreds of children has all of the Maghreb to himself. </p>"

An eccentric trio to say the least, and starting close to each other this region is unpredictable and explosive. Makhnovia has a sizable following, and the Kalymks too are part of the popular Oirat trio. Expect Kazan to want to crash the rivalry, though.</p>"

The two also have strong fan support behind them, and in the case of Pontus, a known history of success in AI games. Just in the immediate view both command large open domains so one or the other is guaranteed early triumphs.</p>"

Both civs got a fresh coat of paint coming into the game, and both are super qt I must say so myself. Personally I am a Saba fan but Mogadishu has their own meme on the Discord server so if you read ‘Mogchamp’ comments in our posts you should know that Mogadishu often leaves fans with their mouths wide open. </p>"

  narration: "<p>To the west are Sierra Leone led by Thomas Peters and Kanem-Bornu led by Idris Alawma I. Of these two, Kanem-Bornu is the one that comes with the expectation of packing some heat and a nice open location, but Sierra Leone has also been left virtually unchallenged in their corner of nice looking tiles. Both might silently grow away from the screen’s main attention but will bring the action when the time is right.</p>"

Ana Nzinga is making her unprecedented third appearance in the CBR following the release of a newly created Ndongo mod and Rozvi as well comes to us courtesy of NopeCopter and Arilasqueto. In contrast, Eswatini is an old favorite having been released way back in 2019 with the 12 Days of Africa modding event. With the latter two in an immediate deathmatch, one of them can be propelled to immediate regional power status if they move fast enough.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back in Asia we have the Qarmatians led by Abu Tahir al-Jannabi, the Afsharids led by Nader Shah, and Harappa led by Went-Antu. All three civs should be able to build up a decent core before having competition, though it is Harappa which has been tipped to be the regional powerhouse. Harappa overcame a field of other popular picks through a concentrated campaign and is deservedly rewarded with high prospects. The Qarmatians also coming in with much hype during the voting period but has had its momentum somewhat dampened by less than stellar AI game performances. Perhaps it could be the lesser talked about Afsharids that can make Persia proud and be the real winner in the region.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Above in the steppes are Bukhara led by Muhammad Shaybani, Kazakhstan led by Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the Dzungars led by Galdan Khan. While these three seem to have space to expand and move about, the terrain they contested is not so stellar, so I think at best only one will be surviving past the mid-game. I will selfishly ping my own Dzungars as the more likely given their aggressive nature and ability to make it rain men throughout the hilly landscape. Bukhara is also militarily focused with an edge fighting outside their borders so they could also delight and expand beyond the edges of this screenshot. Kazakhstan is in a bit of a mess, they will need more than just a little luck to go with all that potassium to survive the onslaught.  </p>"

As mentioned above, the Selkups have a favorable forecast for domination, if they do not become more preoccupied filling all the lakes with fish. Mongolia is in a not too bad position themselves, also ranked high on expectations they can make proper use of their location’s vastness of tiles.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>Further east are Shang led by Daji, Goguryeo led by Gwanggaeto, and Ikko-Ikko led by Kennyo. A trio of competitors that might be more obscure to most of the audience, there is actually some neat things to looks forward for each. Shang can reduce population in their own cities to increase luxury resources and can become a cultural leader in the region. Goguryeo is a domination focused civ that is favored by many to be a regional power right from the start judging by their early opponents. Ikko-Ikki is a religion focused civ that converts its religious reach into military advantages with some rather neat mechanics if they can move into the mainland.   </p>"

  narration: "<p>Down below are the Khoshuts led by Güshi Khan, Dai Viet led by Tran Thanh Tong, and Zheng led by Koxinga. All three civs are domination focused and have proven to be steady rivals in test runs that compete with each other for southern China and inland Southeast Asia. Khoshuts are the first Tibetan civ since Mk2 to return to the competition and like to expand beyond their mountains to bring the fight to their enemies. Dai Viet is entirely geared for war and yet also have bonuses for extra culture and science that aim to keep them in pace with their neighbors regardless of the situation. Zheng are one of this season’s pirate civs, and so therefore very based; as expected, they enjoy raiding coastal cities and contesting any waters in their reach.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>Vijayanagara led by Krishnadevaraya is our southern India representative this season and have a bit of a unique blend of bonuses which combine spreading religion, gaining wonders, and filling the map with their tile improvement the Durga to strangle and oppress other competitors. They start with most of India open to them so the strangling has to wait until they expand to meet their neighbors. On the other side of the Bay of Bengal are Siam led by Rama V, our first Thai civ in the CBR. It has been a long time coming and Rama V is a social policy hoarder that will convert a cultural advantage into bursts of border expansion, production, and food. Expect them to grow a decent chunk before being in any danger. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Elsewhere are Singapore led by Lee Kuan Yew and Maguindanao led by Muhammad Kudarat. Singapore is an economy and trade focused civ that will make the empire the commercial hub the IRL city state is renowned for. Whether that measures up to success here is yet to be seen. Maguindanao are our other pirate civ and a definite rival to Zheng. Maguindanao is entirely focused on coastal raiding with a unique religious twist which makes them the most pious of bandits in all the seven seas. They will be plundering ships left and right while preaching the good word to their victims.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In Australia we have the long awaited Noongar led by Yagan and Palawa led by Tarenorerer. It is a new kind of setup for the continent having both civs in the lower corners, and it guarantees they split the lower half between themselves and will leave the upper half open for foreign footholds. Strangely enough, both of these civs have a synergy with each other from pillaging tiles and repairing them, so war between both sides can prove to be mutually beneficial and we might see both these civs want to skirmish with each other but focus their true attention elsewhere.</p>"

Their bonuses ensure that their units will begin with enough XP to get a nice set of promotions and gain food for every hill tile which might mean a big population of Wahgi will colonize the Pacific. </p>"

We might have come accustomed to sleepy Pacific civs but Bora Bora will be the exact opposite, hoping to making tactical plays happen and spread a religion that can influence both Asia and South America.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the North American Arctic we have Thule led by Javraganak and the Yellowknives led by Akaitcho. Thule is a culturally focused group that might be content in their isolated start to turtle up while war happens elsewhere. The Yellowknives are equally content with an isolated start but will use their abilities to spawn strategic resources to prep for a fight with rivals below. If both of these civs avoid each other, they can grow to a decent size before encountering trouble.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The civs that wished they had as much room are the Pueblo led by Po'pay, the Crow led by Joe Medicine Crow, my homies the Osage led by Pawhuska, and the Shawnee led by Tecumseh. These four are set up for a gauntlet, the Osage and Shawnee in particular, being pitted against each other for even a chance to survive past the early game. Domination focused, each will not be shy to be in constant warfare, so should prove to be an entertaining bunch, even if they might not all be around for long. </p>"

  narration: "<p>To the east are the Seneca led by Cornplanter and the Floridas led by Gregor MacGregor. Off-screen the previous slide, but Seneca is a common instigator in the North American war theater being a civ that benefits with bonuses from being involved in coalition wars. The Floridas are a wildcard civ that also benefit from being in a constant state of conflict though enjoy making a fortune from war as opposed to conquering, so will be in the middle of an odd dynamic wanting to tag along the inner continental action. </p>"

They are a culture and military minded civ that will want to sit back until gunpowder units come along to really hit a noticeable power spike that they can exploit to become a superpower. Given their relative safe position, they might do just that while we are focused elsewhere in the episodes to come. </p>"

That is admittedly a low bar given the performances from others since then, so you’ll have to believe me when I state that Tiano will be a threat for all civs who settle along the coasts.   </p>"

Going into voting, it did not seem likely that either of these would be the eventual winners, but have been charmed during tests. Both are religious focused civs that will be immediate rivals to each other, give it time and don’t be surprised to find them carving up the continent.  </p>"

New Holland is an early fan favorite even before voting and are our token Dutch civ of the season. They are a terrain benefiting civ that love jungle tiles, so don’t fear losing out on a healthy Amazon. Rio Grande are completely unrelated to Season 2’s Rio Grande and yet are also cowboys that are totally about herding cattle, both on land and on sea (you read that right). </p>"
