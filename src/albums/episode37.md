  narration: "<p>Welcome to the final pre-Endgame part for CBRX season one! I’m Chris, known on the sub as /u/AutisticNotWeird - and woah, this part has been a challenge to narrate. While I have the opportunity during this one non-fiction slide, let me explain what you’re in for. (Those who saw my post last week, skip forward.)</p><p> </p><p>Two weeks ago, /u/Coiot posted on the sub explaining how getting images after turn 700 – or enough images to fill whole parts as we’re accustomed to – has been impossible. He has, however, managed to salvage some maps. So that’s what we have, between turns 700 and 900. After that, nothing was salvageable until the game’s final turn. (So essentially, this part will have maps every five turns from 700-900, and one map for 1024.)</p><p> </p><p>But – rather than this whole part being nothing but pixelated maps, I’ve tried to do something different and more engaging (and hopefully, something that does justice to this tournament so far): introducing lore, narrative, OC and lookback, during these final days of the battle as we know it. And once in a while, /u/Gragg9 will be jumping in with interesting bits of statistical analysis. (While I’m at it, special thanks to /u/LacsiraxAriscal and /u/wthrudoin for their lore map, which was priceless for finding city names in a part filled only with maps!)</p><p> </p><p>And now, going into fiction mode to cover this tournament’s past, its present and its future. Let me tell you a story that shaped a world.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Painted Map"

  narration: "<p>The painting looked beautiful on the wall of Pedro’s office. They always did.</p><p>He steadied it so it hung perfectly straight, and took a step back. Private Vihreaa had gifted him these world maps since time immemorial, and they were always a joy to receive. They gave life and culture to the events on his pixelated screen.</p><p>Thousands of years on a submarine in the Atlantic, and Pedro never tired of watching his world. It was duty, in its purest form.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The thought of thousands of years had never felt imposing to Pedro. He had already lived through enough millennia.</p><p>His experience of subduing and ruling his first cylinder had proven him to be the perfect successor to the great Nebuchadnezzar. He had demonstrated all the qualities of the ideal observer: patience, resilience, and the willingness to take extreme action when necessary. The passing of the torch had been the most defining day of his life, caught on camera by a photographer known only by his professional name, “Jru247”.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turn 705"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>That was the problem with painted maps. They quickly became outdated. Within five years of it hanging on his wall, the Qin had made landfall onto mainland Shikoku territory. The formerly Korean peninsula did not look likely to hold either: a huge twist in fate for a civilisation that had previously surprised everyone with its competence.</p><p> </p><p>Gragg’s note: One Shikoan City has been removed from existence. Likely from excessive nuking. And not to stack bad news on top of bad news, but the last remnants of the Aztec army died on turn 701. They made it to the last episode though!</p>"

  scene_title: "Safety and vulnerability"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another five years passed, and Pedro rose from his seat to take a walk along his submarine. Whenever he did, he was struck with equal feelings of safety and vulnerability.</p><p>Safety, because he and his crew were deep underwater, and sheltered behind enormous Antarctic mountains – which themselves were guarded by vast ice shelfs.</p><p>Vulnerability, because their submarine was the one unit holding the cylinder together. Pedro did not know all the details, or any of the science behind “nuclear tectonic bonding”, but if his submarine were ever to vanish, the cylinder’s turns would end – and all life would perish.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As predicted, Korea continued to fall. In the east, New Zealand were kicked out of their own ocean.</p><p>Pedro let out a sigh. Even vast oceans of water could be devastating theatres of war these days.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Hawaii Battle Royale"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Some days, Pedro wished the whole world had stayed small, that the oceans had remained untouched and that the fighting was still done with wooden arrows instead of photon lasers. He thought back to the millennia where no human had set foot on the Hawaiian islands. A historian called Mr Klonam had once written a detailed tome of those days, before the colonisation of them had sparked the end of the cylinder’s paradise era.</p><p> </p><p>Gragg’s note: The Cylinder has grown so populated that it is impossible for the sub’s complex software to carry out an accurate census. Many civs have reached the magical number of 2.1 billion+ citizens. Currently the cylinder population is around 40 BILLION people. (Earth has ~7 billion)</p>"

  narration: "<p>As Pedro dreamed about bows and arrows, the Korean peninsula fell to laser robots. The final city of Hwangju on the coast held the last of the dying Shikoku soldiers. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe stole two Uruguayan colonies, and New Zealand did their best to stay relevant by irritating the Nazca.</p><p>Pedro had always admired that about Seddon: whether his empire had been weak or strong, he had consistently fought with the ambitious aggression of a superpower.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Xia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>It reminded him of how the Xia had once been. The only difference was that Seddon had succeeded and Yu had died.</p><p>When Pedro thought about it, the Xia were a fine representation of what winners needed to be. Fearing no enemy, being far too ambitious, and taking risks that would end in either glory or death – either being better than existence as a turtled state. The Xia had held the right attitude to conquer the whole world – and had they not been snuffed out so early, perhaps in an alternate world they could have done so.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Qin – largely held responsible for the Xia’s downfall even though Canton had finished them off – continued to show why they had earned the dead civ’s lands. They lay waste to the Shikoku capital of Kochi, an impossible feat a mere hundred years earlier, and spread north in an attempt to cut their remaining empire in two. Uruguay, fresh from losing the Haitian capital of Pòtoprens to the Iroquois, took the city of Ocongalla from the Nazca, having long separated it from the rest of its empire.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The strategy of splitting up empires was not a new one, although it had rarely been done well. Back in the days when Algeria had been settling cities exclusively to annoy their neighbours, Pedro had gone to bed and dreamed up this perfect analogy for what the Algerians were doing. Well, in his dream it had been explained to him by an Albino Riding a Dino, but either way it had made him laugh.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turn 725"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The next time Pedro awoke from a dream, the world had changed. Not because of Uruguay’s haul of three cities (including Pòtoprens), not because of the banishment of the Nazca from New Zealand’s lands, and not even because of the final fall of the Korean peninsula. Not even because Venice, after enough time to try any immortal’s patience, had finally broken through the Balkan mountains and taken Bursa from the Ottomans!</p><p>But because the much-loved Selk’nam, whom Pedro had enjoyed watching for thousands upon thousands of years, had been snuffed out by the Nazca navy.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Selk’nam (photo credit: DustyGrrl)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Selk’nam had never been a contender for the entire cylinder thanks to the sheer power of Uruguay (and in Pedro’s experience, civs based in Uruguay’s part of the world tended to do well), but they had been entertaining to watch. High ambitions, occasional competence, and a damned scary-ass culture. Pedro, hoping that the last Selk’nam had safely come to rest in the loving arms of Cthulhu, reached for his keyboard and searched his database for the folder of “Funeral arrangements for former immortals”, which he found immediately by pressing F.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Even with eternity on his side, Pedro often found himself too busy. With the death of Xo’on Uhan-Té barely dealt with, he found himself witnessing the burning of the Beta Israeli city of Salalah, the Nazca pushing further into the Pacific, and the death of another immortal.</p><p>Edirne had fallen. Mehmed, and his Ottoman Empire, had been put out of their misery by Alaric and the Goths.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "The Ottomans (photo credit: FrodosPurse)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Ottomans, to their credit, had survived longer than they had earned any right to. Their whole civilisation had become a living museum: a people who had fought well and even killed Minos in their early days, and spent the rest of their years just surviving so those old stories could be passed down. And it had worked: but the question in Pedro’s mind was whether those stories would continue now their living museum was destroyed.</p><p>Pedro sat upright from his wondering, and pressed the F key again.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turn 735"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>After the death of the Ottomans, the cylinder experienced five years of consistent borders. The building of a brand new city by Palmyra was literally the lead story for the cartographers of that period, giving the impression that the world was at peace. How wrong they were.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Club Loser"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>The deception of peace had been around since the beginning. The death of the Xia had been the last extinction for a long, long time, and had led to the crew seeing the cylinder as boring, although nothing could have been further from the truth. Thousands were dying back then, just like millions were dying now, but no nation was going extinct. “Club Loser”, the comic strip in the submarine newspaper’s cartoon page, had contained images of just Yu, sat alone on A Redundant Sofa.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Turn 740"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Five years of bombings and death followed, and the net result was little beyond coffin sellers getting rich. Palmyra expanded on their own subcontinent, and a Manx general called Kirk Michael had taken back their rightful homeland.</p><p>Or was the city called Kirk Michael? Or was it named after a Kirk Michael who had founded it and/or conquered it? Pedro had forgotten. Those crazy Manx.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Silly little wars"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>European warfare had always been a little bizarre. With the memories of Mehmed still on Pedro’s mind, he remembered the Ottomans’ rather bizarre style of warfare, and how it had ultimately led Mehmed to his own spot on Club Loser’s No-Longer-Redundant Sofa. As effective as the surviving European civilisations had been, Pedro did not see the continent hosting any ultimate winners.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turn 745"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Five years of “nothing” followed. The deaths continued, but the borders stayed the same. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were fighting and dying in a race to stand still. That was what war looked like at the end of the technology tree: a long, drawn out, ferociously advanced stalemate. (With the infamous peacekeepers both helping and hindering, depending on each leader’s perspective.)</p>"

  scene_title: "The appliance of science"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>As much as the advance of technology made Pedro sad, it helped to remember how misguided they had been without it. Robert the Bruce had been hilariously avoidant of academia, which one would think would have made him focus more on his military prowess.</p><p>Science mattered back then just as much as it did now. Whether it was the invention of writing, the development of the Nexus, or even the creation of the Bulletproof Cookie.</p><p> </p><p>Gragg’s note: Scotland has the fewest techs of any civ on the cylinder now (civs like Xia, Korea, Murri had all their units killed). They’re most recent discovery was that of simple machines, which they worked out while watching the drones and super soldiers of Greenland fight it out.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turn 750"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pedro kept watch, as no borders changed. But he was far from bored: someday the extinctions would begin again, just as they had after the long post-Xia break, when death had come for Minos.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "The Minoans"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Truth be told, the Minoans had impressed Pedro. Originating on such a tiny island, they were either going to die quickly or be magnificent. Ultimately they had done both, expanding far wider than they had reasonably been expected to, and fighting far better.</p><p>It had meant death, but a death worthy of remembrance. Children in modern schools would learn about their history and culture, even if only Pedro and the last remaining immortals remembered them in person.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Turn 755"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Over the next five years, the Nazca took San José de Mayo from Uruguay and straightened out their borders. Pedro tried to imagine how many regular low-ranking soldiers had lay dead on the ground for the next wave of soldiers to climb over, their vast numbers led by so few generals who sat back and let their subordinates do the fighting.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "The Algerians"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>To be fair though, that had been where Algeria (caretakers of northwest Moorish Africa) had got it so wrong: too many leaders, not enough subordinates. You could train your entire population to be great generals, but without the soldiers on the ground, all the barked commands in the world could not save you.</p><p>True military discipline involved taking orders, not just giving them and expecting obedience. Algeria had not realised this, and rued the Dey when the Moors came.</p>"

- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "The Libyans"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pedro had had thousands of years – most of which sat in the same chair – to memorise the world and everything in it, and there were still whole nations he had to consciously make an effort to remember. Libya was one of these, swallowed up entirely by another nation that had also since become extinct.</p><p>In a world where sixty out of sixty-one civilisations were sure to die, it was every leader’s responsibility to make their existence memorable, and Libya had failed.</p>"

  scene_title: "Silence"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>But towards the end of them, Pedro’s submarine had its first major panic in nine-thousand years. A Uruguayan nuclear sub came within discovery distance of the Antarctic mountains, and for six months nobody in Pedro’s crew had been allowed to speak any higher than a whisper. The first step to the sub’s destruction – and the collapse of the entire cylinder – was others finding out they existed. And if they were discovered there would be no guarantee of peace: the world’s leaders had no aversion to violence, as they had proven many, many, many times.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Scottish"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>But aside from the catastrophe of Glasgow, Scotland had set out some excellent defence. Building a Great Wall and carpeting with ranged units would have been a sure-fire strategy for survival, were it not for their neighbours attacking over the water.</p><p>The Vikings had known where their opponents were weak, and struck it with full force. It had been like a warrior spending their whole lives preparing for an epic Kung Fu showdown, learning every move in the book and building up every muscle in their body… only to have a Viking opponent throw peanuts at them and trigger their fatal allergy.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Five year passed and the map did not change.</p><p>Perhaps everyone still on this cylinder had earned their right to stay there. For the most part, those who didn’t deserve it were no longer around.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "The Omani"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>It made Pedro remember how not all civilisations were meant for this world. Oman just hadn’t been the right fit for such a cut-throat cylinder, hoarding money in the desert as their enemies founded true empires. Hemmed in by Palmyra along their peninsula, they had become helpless as their enemies – just like with Scotland – had attacked from the sea.</p><p>It was a lesson most other civilisations had taken to heart: develop a fighting expansionist instinct, or lose your cities to those who did.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Canadians"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Of course, not all of the dead had been a poor fit for the world. Canada had been an underrated example of fighting spirit. Kneecapped before they even got running, they had kept running anyway. Sure, it had been embarrassing and painful to watch, but the more Pedro thought about it, the more he respected it.</p><p>Survival wasn’t about dignity. It was about survival.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The biggest event in over a decade happened mid-yawn, and the Nazca took Haiyuwel. Uruguay appeared not to mind too much.</p><p>With nothing else to talk about, Pedro had to tolerate the “Hi, you well?” puns from his crew for literally years afterwards.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Poverty Point"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>When he had conquered a cylinder himself, Pedro had done so with compassion and culture. His swathes of soldiers had switched from conquest to carnival as soon as their enemies had been dispatched, and won the hearts and minds of their new civilians.</p><p>Had Poverty Point conquered the world, perhaps they would have had the same compassion. Unfortunately, their compassion had been a compromising one, allowing their enemies to get away with too much in the name of being nice. Real leadership, even compassionate leadership, meant being uncompromising, and those elders had not lived long enough to learn that.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Turn 790"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The cylinder kept turning, its borders changing no faster than the tectonic plates beneath them. (And that was especially slow, given the submarine’s power to keep those tectonic plates in position and hold the world together. Cylinders were unfriendly shapes for the formation of a planet where everyone lived on the crust.)</p>"

  narration: "<p>When the civilisations had run out of room on their own continents to colonise, they had come to Antarctica. Thankfully, too far away from the nuclear submarine for Pedro to be worried. And what had these empires achieved in the frozen wasteland? About as much as one would predict.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Ndongo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>In his boredom, Pedro ruminated over the fact that some deaths he felt worse about than others. Ndongo, for example, had fallen from a state of security to extinction in barely any time at all, but it was difficult to feel sorry for them.</p><p>Declaring war on a troubled neighbour was a smart enough idea, but doing so without an army of your own was foolhardy at best. Overconfidence was the one thing that could overcome smartness, as Nzinga had experienced herself.</p>"

  scene_title: "Turn 800"

  narration: "<p>Suddenly, there was action. Uruguay taking back Haiyuwel from the Nazca, the Apache capturing Kung from the Haida city and cutting off Sirenik… and Beta Israel being thrown off their own continent forever. A people who had once occupied the Horn of Africa with pride were reduced to a town called Pedeme on the southwest tip of the Arabian peninsula, so small it could barely be distinguished from Palmyran territory.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This is Junior Information Officer Gragg9 stepping in to review the action for a moment while Pedro takes a quick nap. While not many borders have changed the past few years, plenty of cities changed hands since T700 when we started. Shikoku in particular lost 5 cities in one turn, which includes the first city nuked entirely out of existence (probably). I estimate around 2 BILLION citizens have lost their lives in the bloodshed so far.</p>"

  scene_title: "T800 Military"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>This chart may appear like a bunch of parallel lines at first, but there are some interesting things to note. Beginning with one that will excite, Uruguay is at the bottom of this particular list. As of turn 800 they have the 9th largest military. It also appears that the Moor’s have finally decided to build a military worthy of their status. The Metis military is a testament to consistency.</p>"

  scene_title: "T800 Production"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>Production, the ability of a civ to quickly build infrastructure and military, has been relatively stable. As civs reach the end of the tech tree there are fewer buildings to build that increase this stat. Golden ages are clearly visible and almost constant among most civs. In the face of nuclear hellfire Shikoku struggles to remain above average in this stat.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode37-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>As sad as it was to see a formerly competent civ become nothing, it was the way of the cylinder. Back in the day, the Sulu had built a formidable navy. When the enormous Taungoo had attacked, they had fought back with fantastic enthusiasm. However, melee units were not their thing. With a population almost entirely comprised of ranged fighters, the Sulu had lost their empire because too few of them had been willing to thrust a sword into an opponent up close.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mountain civilisations rarely did well in tournaments like this. Pedro had his own memories of Tibet and Afghanistan, and knew that whereas mountains stunted invading forces, fending off invasions was not enough to win continents. Mountains also stunted your own ability to grow your cities and carpet your lands with soldiers. Their home territory, combined with lacklustre military campaigns, had sealed Beta Israel’s status as a dead civilisation in waiting.</p>"

Perhaps they had learned a lot about siege tactics while invading the Golden Horde, who had left their cities open for them to practise.
