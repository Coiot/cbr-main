  narration: "<p>First we have some words of wisdom from u/Staunch_Boat_Mormon.</p><p></p><p>I’ve been ignoring Uruguay all my life, and they haven’t killed me yet, so I can confirm, it’s good advice.</p>"

  narration: "<p>First map we have is the delightful Subjectively Pretty Diagram of Objectively Relevant Wars. I absolutely love this map, and it really helps keep track of what’s what. I don’t envy u/ThyReformer’s job though, as it should be increasingly difficult to determine what’s relevant as tech grows.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And here’s my own Terrain Accurate Map! </p><p></p><p>Now that most of the territory is filled, I’ll probably start posting the Terrain Map over the Rivers Map. It’s a lot prettier than the Rivers map (which is honestly kind of redundant). Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I haven’t seen just yet, but I’m going to assume the Mighty Guay still dominates the Power Rankings. It’s ok though, it just makes them more ripe for the inevitable Ḥ̨̝̠̣͇̼a̰͉͉͓̰r͎̩v̱͈̝̹͙͠e̴͔s͙t̷͚̺̮͕͈̗.</p>"

  scene_title: "Grandma on the  Offensive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>And into the abyss we dive! Grandma continues her assault on the fledgling Russians, having already put several northern cities to the torch. Nizhny Novgorod takes some moderate damage, but with such a large army right outside the city gates, and few brave Russians to defend it, I have a feeling this won’t end in a happy Muscovy.</p>"

  scene_title: "Stopping the Autocrats"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Winnipeg sits in the black but the Metis pride themselves at sniping melee units. If anything, the Iroquois city of Neodakheat is in far more peril. The Great Lakes are filled with musketmen but I somehow doubt the AI is smart enough to get them to the frontlines fast enough.</p>"

  scene_title: "Saharan Rumble"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Benin has had a rough go. Citadel’d to oblivion (though not nearly to the Point of Poverty) and half a core made mostly of worthless Sahara. At least their UA is kicking in, which buffs the range of their “city attack”. They probably won’t beat Nubia, but with the right snipe, they could devastate Napata.</p>"

  scene_title: "Oman Gets Bullied"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oman is a good lad. Oman doesn’t deserve this. India has seized two of their cities while the so-called peacekeepers of Madagascar prepare to eradicate them completely. </p><p></p><p>The Sultan may need to find new residence in Zanzibar. If he can make it.</p>"

  scene_title: "Legends of the Northern Saint"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>A swarm of mounted war reindeer bear down on the newly captured city of Skedans. Some soldiers report seeing a fat bearded man dressed in white and red leading the vanguard, but the Koreans mostly chalk that up to a local legend.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Puns and Arson"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh Iroquois… buddy... The puns I could make about “Neodakheat” burning down are just overwhelming. Winnipeg stands strong and Hiawatha has but 3 weak melee units nearby. The tides are turning, but perhaps Haida is having more luck?</p><p></p><p>But that’s not all! In the corner we see that Maratha has constructed the Red Fort, a powerful wonder that grants it’s home city +12 defense, and +25% strength to defense buildings Empire-wide. This is massive. Even if their skirmishes with Sulu have been less than impressive, this could, if nothing else, make them incredibly safe for the foreseeable future.</p><p></p><p>Und was ist das??</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Der Kampf der Deutschen"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Der Kampf der Deutschen has begun once more! Speyer is already blockaded but the battlefield is fairly narrow. HRE’s frigates are likely to hold the line in the Baltic, so I imagine this war will mostly consist of a lot of dead Germans between the Elbe and Oder.</p><p></p><p>A third party could tip the scales dramatically.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Nenets on the Run"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Those who guessed +Nenets this week might be regretting that very soon. Nyar’yana Marq is being swarmed and the cities they recently captured are already a sneeze away from reclamation. The Kazakhs were once ranked first for a reason: lots of arable land and weak neighbors. The legends may have been true after all.</p>"

  scene_title: "Low Tech in the Year 2070"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>That Citadel Nepal plopped long ago is paying off, with Dehli immediately taking damage. However… Nepal’s best melee units right now are Longswordsmen… stuck in Tibet… in the year 2070. This war is a tossup, but Maratha holds all the power to decide it’s final result.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Pearl of the Desert"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah Palmyra. The Pearl of the Desert. I personally voted for Assyria under Sammurat for their absurd innuendo-laden leader dialogue, but Palmyra was my second favorite.</p><p></p><p>Their Empire has shaped up quite nicely, though many of their Arabian cities are looking surprisingly vulnerable. Funerary Towers dot the sands, and Malagasy peacekeepers quietly revel in Nizwa.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Ostrava Stronk"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ostrava is a truly blessed city. The Czechs were dealt a very bad hand this game, but that damned city has not only survived countless Ottoman assaults, but has actually grown in size through Citadel placement.</p><p></p><p>Giving open borders to Venice may just lead to Bursa’s fall. It won’t save Czechia, but sticking it to their green rivals may be enough for Havel.</p><p></p><p>Manx has also joined Prussia against HRE. Very few of their nearby cities are coastal, so I’m not expecting much concrete help.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Authoritarian Lumberjacks"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Looks like I was too hasty! The authoritarian lumberjacks seize Winnipeg and bring the city from 19 to 9. Fun fact, that’s going from 3.8 Million people to 469k. 3.3 Million civilians, or 88% of the city just died.</p><p></p><p>Unperturbed by the violence, the Iroquois prepare to place a new settlement on the ashes of Neodakheat. A smattering of Poverty Pointers watch with horror.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Ile-Ife is Ill, with less Life"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ile-Ife is down, and the war rages on. Composites just can’t stand up to a wall of crossbowmen. Benin’s core is stronger than these desert towns, so they may be able to stop the bleeding.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Oman Downed"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not to be outdone by the Iroquois, Madagascar seizes Salalah and opts to put it to the torch. Absolutely brutal. There are a decent number of melee units still remaining, so Oman may not be out just yet.</p><p></p><p>Oman, please start rolling Death Saving Throws.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Stalling Assault"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Erema falls, but the assault on Nyar’yana Marq has seemingly been put on pause. Maybe the Kazakhs abandoned the city in favor of retaking their lost territory.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "A Weaker Britain"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>For a naval Civ, the Manx on the sea are not as threatening as you’d expect, as there are no frigates to be seen. They may own England, but they’re no British Empire.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Man of Freedom"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>A man of honor with a yearning for freedom, Toussaint can’t bear to annex his captured cities.</p><p></p><p>“We are free today because we are the stronger; we will be slaves again when the government becomes the stronger.”</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Hope Extinguished"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Winnipeg is back in Metis hands, and Neodakheat is on its last legs. That settler from before has vanished, and no nearby melee units means Neodakheat is almost certainly doomed and Winnipeg is almost certainly safe.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Bursa Blues"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene24.jpg

  scene_title: "Everybody Hates The Isle of (Ray)Mann(d)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Operation Manx-No-More is a go, with the Apache and Vikings launching an offensive on the Isles. The Apache declaration might seem meaningless, but recall that they actually share a Greenland border with Manx. </p><p></p><p>The Three Scottish Forts are going to play a crucial role in the coming fighting in Scotland.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Passing Those Constitution Saves"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>NATURAL 20! Oman, you’re conscious with 1 HP. Top of the Round… what do you wanna do?</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the world is rooting for their demise, but they are refusing to go down quietly. Oman hasn’t done much this Battle Royale, but these final moments have been endearing.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Flashbacks to Incompetence"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Putorana takes damage but the Kazakhs haven’t sent that much to take it. I’m getting Muscovy-Goth War flashbacks when the Goths had overwhelming numbers but failed to do anything because they split their forces evenly.</p><p></p><p>They need to start insettling before a coalition knocks them down a peg.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Kazakh’s Enemies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speak of the devil! Nepal and Palmyra decide they’re disappointed in the Kazakh performance too and collectively declare war. Unfortunately for them, Khamug blissfully blocks Nepal and Parthia blocks Palmyra. </p><p></p><p>Maybe next time, guys.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Sneaking Tonga Time?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tonga sends a massive detachment of soldiers… somewhere? They’re at war with Nazca and Uruguay, so unless this is a sneak attack on Shikoku or something, I’m at a loss.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Haida Flounders"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>So that whole Haida offensive is evidently NOT going well. Kasaan is virtually defenseless and looks destined to fall soon. Tanu is tiny and similarly vulnerable, and at least the coast of Cascadia looks strong.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "OWO"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>OWO what’s this?? Kongo declares on Benin but has a paltry army. What were they thinking?</p><p></p><p>Benin may be losing desert cities to the north, but this is a prime opportunity to fix some of this dreadful bordergore and establish a more fertile core.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Madagascar scores a crit on Oman and fails their remaining Death Saves. And with that, Oman is no more.</p><p></p><p>What can be said about Oman? They settled the coast of Arabia and that’s basically it. Their defense of their remaining cities was brave but ultimately futile in the face of stronger empires. </p><p></p><p>The Sultan of Oman now lives in the Zanzibar of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Press ف to pay respects.</p>"

  narration: "<p>There it is! The borders haven’t changed yet, but this is a good sign for Benin. A large Ndongo fleet is approaching so it probably won’t be held for long, but I have to give them credit where it’s due.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Goths ally with the HRE and declare war on Prussia.

  narration: "<p>Peace for the Murri. This war was an absolute shitshow, but they’re not dead yet. What once looked like a slam dunk became two broken ankles, literally. Instead of becoming dominant on the continent, all of their neighbors have grown, particularly their former Kiwi allies.</p><p></p><p>Murri has open borders with Papua, so that may indicate some semblance of protection, but I still don’t see them surviving for long.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, new wars break out in Africa. Palmyra joins the Benin is Bad Brigade, but more importantly, ZIMBABWE DECLARES ON NDONGO. Benin’s chances of getting out of these wars in one piece just doubled.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Ndongo capital of Kabasa is already in danger, and Matamba is mostly defended by hapless workers. The gears are in motion, and the engine of destruction alights. </p><p></p><p>Rumors abound that the great leader Nyatsimba Mutota seeks wisdom from vengeful, orange ghost, pale and not entirely whole. This spirit speaks of his destiny to rule over the entire African continent, to unite all the peoples under one beautiful banner.

If Benin loses that, they’ll have to shift attention from Ndongo to strictly defense, and it will all be over.</p><p></p><p>Indian also makes peace with Nepal.

  narration: "<p>Green(land) Lake was moments from new management, but a sudden peace deal narrowly saves the arctic metropolis. Haida and Venezuela make peace as well, largely ending the coalition against Metis.</p><p></p><p>Notably, our Canadian friends are still at war. I can’t imagine that’ll go well without support.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Port Erin falls to the Vikings, and a massive army marches to Edinburgh.</p><p></p><p>Australia and Papua make peace, and judging from the minimap, nothing changed hands.</p>"

  scene_title: "Back to Beta Israel"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene63.jpg
  narration: "<p>Eko and Ewohimi look ready to fall, with a good amount of Melee units nearby. Notably, Beta Israel doesn’t seem to be sending much support.</p><p></p><p>To the Northeast, a coalition against India seems to be brewing.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bergen Holds"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene64.jpg
  narration: "<p>Bergen is in danger, but the Vikings refuse to send melee units. After the brutal citadels at Roksilde, I’m hoping they take it, just to clean up the borders a bit.</p>"

  scene_title: "Jealous of Paradise"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene65.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kermanshah Atolls are gorgeous this time of year, but such beauty inspires jealousy. Khamug and Australia declare war, but claiming this land is likely a pipedream.</p><p></p><p>Gotta make use of those islands before industrialization eventually buries them beneath the sea.</p>"

  scene_title: "Haida Prepares"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene66.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now that the war is over, Haida is militarizing for the next one.</p><p></p><p>Ile-a-la Crosse hosts most of the Metis forces, but with a first strike fast enough, Haida could do quite a bit of damage.</p><p></p><p>We can also see a nice shot of Haidan Machu Picchu. Not sure what domesticated animals were able to bring supplies up the mountains to build it, but it certainly wasn't llamas.</p>"

  scene_title: "Winnipeg Decimated"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene67.jpg
  narration: "<p>Metis kept Winnipeg, but it was devastated in the fighting. Ultimately, no territory actually changed hands between the two powers, but the next time they go at it, I’d put my money on the Iroquois. Their nearby cities are much stronger production centers.</p>"

  scene_title: "Papuans Left and Right!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene68.jpg
  narration: "<p>A slew of new Papuan cities are plopped. Hohodae, Baruni, Tatana, and Poreporena arise, with room for another on the tip of Cape York.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Metis Civil War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene69.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Apache generals have been planning this for years.</p><p></p><p>Failure to pay veterans of the Iroquois wars, difficulty supplying the more remote settlements, anger at the failure of the government to protect Winnipeg. The people no longer trusted their leaders, and the Apache knew it. Local militias have been arming for months as tensions rose, and the Apache had been quietly supplying them during the chaos of war.</p><p></p><p>And now, when they were at their most vulnerable, the Apache would declare war on the Metis Government, in the name of the People. They would liberate the downtrodden, or so they claimed. Whether or not this rampant propaganda would win hearts is yet to be seen, but it was enough to spur brutal Civil War south of Batoche.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene70.jpg
  narration: "<p>Eko and Ewohimi fall, and Udo is threatened. This is still anyone’s game, and if Beta Israel decided to help in any way, Benin could fall.</p>"

  scene_title: "Incursion into China"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene71.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh bother.</p><p></p><p>Shikoku has a much stronger navy, but that window to attack is fairly narrow. I’m not expecting much, but I’d love to be surprised.</p>"
- scene_number: 72
  scene_title: "Golden Defense"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene72.jpg
  narration: "<p>A huge force surrounds Merv, which is finally annexed by the Golden Horde. With that pesky mountain in the way, I’d wager on a successful Golden Defense here.</p><p></p><p>Also a Great Parthian General primed to steal Uranium from Palmyra.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Liberators Attack"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene73.jpg
  narration: "<p>Frog Lake is surrounded. The Liberators, as they call themselves, prepare a siege, demanding the government surrender power.</p><p></p><p>Unrelated, but I have to assume “Frog Lake” refers to Salt Lake. Then again, Fishing Lake sits in the middle of open plains, and Green Lake sits on the decidedly lakeless Greenland. I think Metis just likes trolling with their naming conventions.</p>"

  scene_title: "No More Razing?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene74.jpg
  narration: "<p>Port Erin flips again, and a stateless Minoan vessel moves in to watch the carnage. I’m shocked the Vikings have stopped endlessly razing everything.</p><p></p><p>Maybe they just really hated Robert the Bruce.</p>"
- scene_number: 75
  scene_title: "Beta Israel is Lazy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene75.jpg
  narration: "<p>Eko is taken back, and the melee-drought becomes a problem again for Nubia. </p><p></p><p>Still very little effort being put in by Beta Israel. They’ll never seize Lake Chad at this rate.</p>"
- scene_number: 76
  scene_title: "Yup’ik Core"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene76.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Yup’ik Core. They’re no Inuit, but I’m surprised how strong their cities look. Most city defenses are stronger than the Haidan Aleutians, and there are certainly more units in the area. Those citadels are brutal though.</p>"
- scene_number: 77
  scene_title: "MARATHA CORE"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene77.jpg
  narration: "<p>That’s not a core. THIS is a core!</p><p></p><p>Maratha is very stronk, with super high defense and a full carpet of advanced units. They could take the entire subcontinent in a matter of turns.</p>"
- scene_number: 78
  scene_title: "“Defenses” Gone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene78.jpg
  narration: "<p>Matamba’s workers have all been captured, and the city is nearing the end. Zimbabwe needs to bring units other than Crossbowmen, but it’s still looking good for Mutoba.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Impending End"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene79.jpg
  narration: "<p>Calgary and Windsor are doomed, frankly, without the support of the Iroquois. This is why we don’t trust autocrats to keep their word, Mackenzie.</p><p></p><p>And of course, we see more ridiculous names.</p><p></p><p>Buffalo Lake on frozen Baffin. Paddle Prairie on a barren tundra. Gift Lake on a tiny icy island. Someone needs to raze these cities ASAP. It’s absolutely haram.</p>"

  scene_title: "Apparently War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene80.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh, there’s a war between the Iroquois and Kuikuro? Apparently Itsagahiti is about to fall.</p><p></p><p>Benin also hates Haida.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pirate Battles"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene81.jpg
  narration: "<p>A massive sea confrontation rages outside a pair of Zimbabwean islands. The forces are rather even, but even if Ndongo wins, there’s no way they’ll be able to take either city.</p>"

  scene_title: "Labrador on Fire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene84.jpg
  narration: "<p>Calgary is burned. Canada needs to move quickly to stop it from disappearing completely, but with Windsor so close to falling, it’ll take a miracle.</p>"
- scene_number: 85
  scene_title: "Military Logistics and a Wonder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene85.jpg
  narration: "<p>Bergen is damaged but the Viking musketmen are taking their sweet time to get to the front lines. Military logistics are hard, kids.</p><p></p><p>Benin and Beta Israel make peace with barely a unit scratched between them.</p><p></p><p>The Qin also construct the Porcelain Tower, a power science wonder that could help catch them up to the other stronger contenders.</p>"

  scene_title: "Disintegrating Canadians"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene86.jpg
  narration: "<p>Welp, Canada recaptured Calgary, but at the cost of Windsor. In war, there are no winners, only widows.</p><p></p><p>Except for Metis, that is. They’re pretty clearly winning.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene87.jpg
  narration: "<p>Matamba burned! Zimbabwe is making concrete progress, and Kabasa could be next. The Ghost of Kruger grins.</p><p></p><p>Uruguay joins the dogpile on Ndongo, but it probably won’t matter.</p>"

  scene_title: "Khamug Core"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene88.jpg
  narration: "<p>Big scary Khamug core. Lots of crossbows and knights, though no cannons in sight.</p><p></p><p>It’s enough to take Qing, I imagine. I would jump on that now and take those hundred acre woods while Qing is occupied with Shikoku.</p>"
- scene_number: 89
  scene_title: "Antarctic Incursions"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode18-scene89.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh how I was wrong! Ndongo had three Antarctic settlements this whole time, and the Guay intends to spread across the south Atlantic. And who knows what ancient Babylonian secrets lie on the ice shelves, waiting to be uncovered.</p><p></p><p>Well, that’s it for me! Thanks to Blue Cassette for giving me the reigns on narration this time around! Cheers!</p>"
