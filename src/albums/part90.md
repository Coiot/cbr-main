  narration: Welcome back, followers of Nebuchadnezzar, to the r/civ Battle Royale!
    I’m /u/TechnostarBTD5, resident Power Ranker and long-time fan of this sub, and
    I will be guiding you through this installation of the Civ Battle Royale Mk. 2.1.
    Last part, we witnessed the fall of Tibet, portrayed in this lovely artwork by
    /u/arcticwolffox. Et tu, Trungs?
- scene_number: "2"

  narration: As always, we have our excellent map by /u/Spherical_Melon. Aside from
    Boer gains in Arabia, note the disappearance of several more white splotches.
- scene_number: "3"
  scene_title: Image 03
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene03.jpg
  narration: We power rankers did not have a hard time choosing the Boers as our top
    pick this week. Their strong showing against Vietnam so far has shown that they
    still have a lot of expansion prospects, something many other top civs lack.
- scene_number: "4"
  scene_title: Image 04
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene04.jpg
  narration: Pasargadae is back in Vietnamese hands, but the Boers have a mech artillery
    and robot infantry lined up to recapture the city. For now, Skynet has ordered
    the Boer forces to siege Gyumri while the Vietnamese defenders scramble to reinforce
    the city from Artashat. Caught between the crossfires, Exclavia (Finland) had
    better hope that the Boer swarm blocks the Swedish organic infantry and railgun
    armor from taking Hebron.
- scene_number: "5"
  scene_title: Image 05
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene05.jpg
  narration: Vietnam has also recaptured Baghdad, though it looks to be only a matter
    of time before the Boer forces around the city secure it once more. Meanwhile,
    Batticaloa breathes a sigh of relief as its Afghani peacekeepers show no sign
    of leaving.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: Image 06
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene06.jpg
  narration: While the Boers have annihilated all traces of the Vietnamese navy from
    their home waters, their own navy is holed up in the Red Sea. According to Skynet,
    the official reason is to protect embarked units on their way to Vietnam, but
    the missiles loaded on the cybersubs and arsenal ship suggest otherwise.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene07.jpg
  narration: Vietnamese South India seems to have repelled the Boer invaders, though
    two cities are still severely bombarded. I am sure this region is breathing a
    sigh of relief right now.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene08.jpg
  narration: While Vietnam’s core is certainly impressive, the shortage of Vietnamese
    land units show that this state of constant war can eat up even Vietnam’s reserves.
    There are now more Kimberly units in Vietnam’s core than Vietnamese units.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene09.jpg
  narration: The Australian navy, after extorting war reparations from the Buccaneers,
    seems to be pulling back for the time being. Kudos to Parkes for actually putting
    planes on those carriers – perhaps Morgan made peace after seeing those superior
    tactics for himself.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene10.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka has formed a declaration of friendship with Vietnam, forestalling
    their fate for 50 turns more. Though considering how Vietnam turned on even their
    dearest friend Tibet, Sri Lanka might not be as safe as the Trungs have led them
    to believe.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene11.jpg
  narration: Wait, what is this? A barbarian carrier? It seems as though the hiatus
    has given the Autonomous Revolutionary Regiments (Buccaneers) too much authority,
    and one has turned rogue after ending its turn in Inuit waters. As far as I know,
    this is the first time the Buccaneer’s ability has actually spawned a barbarian
    unit – before the hiatus, this never happened.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene12.jpg
  narration: M’banza-Kongo and many other Boer cities finally seem to be recovering
    from the Great Starvation. The Boer military certainly is. Compared to the Inuit
    forces seen last slide, the Boers are slightly less carpeted but just as scary.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene13.jpg
  narration: Brazil has invested wholeheartedly in the Texan war, sending a full division
    of units to Laredo – accompanied by no less than 2 advanced destroyers. It seems
    Pedro has finally had enough of Sam Houston.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene14.jpg
  narration: The situation in the Gulf of Aden has not changed much since we last
    saw it, though Baghdad is in Boer hands at the top of the screen. Batticaloa is
    just as healthy as usual, however…
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene15.jpg
  narration: As we pan north, we see a striking change in the Middle Eastern frontlines.
    Sweden snags Hebron, reducing Exclavia to a 3-city rump on par with Armenia. The
    Boers snag Gyumri and Pasargadae, while Vietnam captures a pointless city in the
    Siberian meatgrinder that is all but guaranteed to flip again next turn. To get
    a sense of the violence, of the 18 cities on this slide, only 5 are completely
    free of damage.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene16.jpg
  narration: Aside from Carrollton’s flip, the other thing to note on this slide is
    the suspicious number of pillaged improvements outside of Merv. While we cannot
    see the fallout directly, I can assume Vietnam quickly retaliated against Kuchum
    Khan’s own nuclear strike. Thankfully for Sibir, it seems a thoughtful bomb shelter
    saved many lives in the metropolis.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene17.jpg
  narration: The Mongolian exclaves are a quiet place in the cylinder… for now. Korea
    still has not built up much of a land carpet, though considering their open borders
    treaty with Mongolia, they might not need one for a while. Alas, passiveness is
    not a good strategy in the cylinder, so Sejong had better start pumping out units
    fast if he wants to stand a chance.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene18.jpg
  narration: It seems the Icelandic Isles are hosting a party for green nations. Brazil,
    Vietnam, and Australia have all been invited to attend. The Trungs even decided
    to take a break from fighting the Boers to show up. A lone Swedish advanced destroyer
    watches on, hoping against hope that Iceland remains as passive as ever.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene19.jpg
  narration: The Australians have the largest military on the cylinder, and it shows
    here. Every land tile and most naval tiles have a unit on them, making Australia
    by far the largest nation to have a full carpet. If they so chose to deploy this
    against Vietnam, the results could be devastating. Though considering how difficult
    it is for the AI to fight in Indonesia, perhaps it won’t be.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene20.jpg
  narration: Mongolia has agreed with Hawaii that they really need to catch up in
    tech, giving us a shot of Mongolia’s core. Mongolia has a carpet for sure, though
    what’s more incredible is that the Australian carpet reaches all the way out here.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene21.jpg
  narration: The Jaws theme starts playing in the background as the Brazilian fleet
    approaches their hapless victim. A lone Hawaiian peacekeeper stands between Texas
    and total annihilation, though do they have what it takes to protect all of Laredo?
    Definitely not.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene22.jpg
  narration: Brazil certainly has done a much better job than the Buccs at militarizing
    the northern Amazon, though the Buccaneers have done their best to fortify what
    parts of the coast they still control.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene23.jpg
  narration: Since we last saw this area, the Boers have swept clear most of the Vietnamese
    defenders around Gyumri and forced Vietnam to retreat to Artashat. In the background,
    Carrollton flips again and the 1000 residents still living in the city complain
    about having to change their flags yet again.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene24.jpg
  narration: Vietnam is making another push towards Pasargadae, though given the rough
    parity between the two sides in the region, it is likely to flip again. As the
    war stands, both sides are struggling to reinforce this bloodbath, as both the
    Arabian and Persian deserts remain void of units.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene25.jpg
  narration: Speaking of bloodbaths… Nishapur is in Siberian hands, while Bamda is
    flying Vietnam’s colors. Though since these things change as quickly as the weather,
    it’s anybody’s guess who will control what at the war’s end. The Australian peacekeepers
    watch in vain as their efforts are ignored.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene26.jpg
  narration: Korea’s land military might not be all that impressive, but these 10-stacks
    of stealth bombers are downright terrifying. That 9-stack in Turfan is likely
    the same or similar composition. If only the AI would use their planes for bombarding
    units as well as cities!
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene27.jpg
  narration: I may be mistaken, but Hoi An’s whopping 45 population may just be the
    largest in the cylinder after the Great Starvation. However, this shot of their
    core also reveals that the unit shortage extends to the rest of Vietnam, not just
    the parts we’ve seen.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene28.jpg
  narration: Our spies have reported in from the Order of the Rump, and up first is
    Armenia. Yerevan is hard at work building an infantry, a unit that the Armenian
    military sorely needs.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene29.jpg
  narration: Up next is Hawaii. This island paradise still has plenty of food to spare,
    though the population is likely to cap at 43 without Future Worlds buildings.
    Naturally, Hawaii is building another peacekeeping unit to promptly send abroad.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene30.jpg
  narration: The defenders of Laredo struggle to put together a defense against the
    approaching Brazilian navy, though one extra anti-aircraft gun will merely buy
    Sam Houston a bit of time to flee with whatever units of his remain.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene31.jpg
  narration: In the Blackfoot capital of Siksikawa, the air force has ordered another
    bomber to be constructed to supplement their overflowing land carpet. If this
    was the modern era, it would be a sight to behold. Alas, the Blackfoot carpet
    pales in comparison to the glacier surrounding them.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene32.jpg
  narration: The Buccaneers are building a VR training center in Port Royal, probably
    based on some stolen Boer technology near their last African colonies. The 26
    citizens in the city bode well for Henry Morgan, especially since his capital
    was nuked just before the hiatus.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene33.jpg
  narration: It seems Morgan had a purpose in mind for that training center. Our spies
    report that the captain is sending a sneak attack towards another civ. It remains
    to be seen whether or not that’s a good idea, but considering how powerful the
    nations around the Buccaneers are, it’s probably not.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene34.jpg
  narration: While Vietnam flipped Pasargadae yet again, the Boers are on Artashat’s
    doorstep. If Vietnam cannot reinforce this front, Persia proper could be in danger.
    While Skynet’s algorithms may struggle with the imposing Iranian mountains, the
    Boer air force has done a good job at bringing almost every Vietnamese city on
    the screen down to 1 HP every turn.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene35.jpg
  narration: Our spies have been dispatched to a new set of cities, ranging in importance
    from the powerful Brazilian and Australian empires to one of the few Exclavian
    cities left.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene36.jpg
  narration: Sweden is taking their sweet time rebuilding their land army, and here
    we see why. Even though every city here is out of resistance, Sweden has barely
    annexed half the cities in this image. While what we see here might just be enough
    to beat Sibir, if Iceland attacks, Sweden will be in almost as much trouble as
    Finland was.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene37.jpg
  narration: Though then again, Iceland has more pressing matters to worry about.
    While the land forces in this area are obviously in the Inuit’s favor, don’t count
    on the Icelandic navy either. The Inuit have nearly twice as many useful ships
    in this slide than Iceland. If the White Walkers ever turn their attention to
    Vinland, Iceland could quickly lose their North American holdings.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene38.jpg
  narration: At last, we have found the Boer navy. A noticeable chunk of their fleet
    has been sent to Antarctica – either for a training exercise or to intercept those
    Vietnamese ships to the northeast. Meanwhile, Hawaii signs yet another research
    agreement, acknowledging the need for technological equality across the cylinder.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene39.jpg
  narration: "Blood pools in the water outside of Laredo. The last Texan defenders
    stare in vain as their city is overwhelmed by the Brazilian navy.  The last Texan
    Great Musician rides off into the sunset, a lone rider disappearing over the horizon.\nSam
    Houston began this game as a powerful member of America’s heartland, though not
    without strife. In the early days of the Royale, Austin flipped between Mexican
    and Texan hands several times. Texas was able to recover though, and eventually
    joined the fight against Lincoln’s radical ideology of freedom. This was the height
    of the Texan empire.\nThen, on part 38, Winter came. The Inuit declared war, and
    with troops left over from their fight with Canada, decisively crushed Texas down
    to Austin before making peace. \nThough Austin was not safe. Mexico eventually
    declared war, but in the most brazen move we’ve ever seen from a city-state, Texas
    snagged Laredo from the Mexicans. Sadly, Austin was lost in the process, and Texas
    was relegated to Laredo as a city-state for the long haul. In a twist of fate,
    Laredo lasted longer than Mexico did. Sam Houston had at long last triumphed over
    is longest rival.\nHouston, you fought well. Ride off into your final sunset with
    pride. Press F to pay respects."
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene40.jpg
  narration: 'As we slide to the north, we see a strange sight in Blackfoot lands:
    a significant number of Australian units. The lands around these parts belonged
    to ‘Straya not too long ago. It seems like Henry Morgan is applying Putin’s strategy
    towards lost land: occupy it “peacefully” until it becomes yours again.'
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene41.jpg
  narration: Just where are the Kimberley going? If I didn’t know better, I would
    have assumed they were trying to invade Vietnam. Thankfully for the Kimberley,
    that is not the case. We are left to wonder what exactly Jandamarra is trying
    to do with this navy.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene42.jpg
  narration: Pasargadae has flipped back into Boer hands, and this time, Kruger has
    personally ordered a division of reinforcements to secure the city. To the north,
    Artashat still hasn’t fallen, though the Vietnamese force around the city has
    all but evaporated.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene43.jpg
  narration: An Australian biodrone and a Siberian biotrooper defend the mountain
    pass outside of Nishapur from some Vietnamese paratroopers, though Vietnam is
    throwing much less units into this meatgrinder as they were before. Is the Vietnamese
    carpet finally exhausted?
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene44.jpg
  narration: If there’s any relief for Vietnam, Sibir’s core looks much, much worse.
    The few biotroopers Sibir can produce are immediately sent to the front lines
    to try and defend any gains they make. There is no room for other units in their
    production queue – the only unit not from the bioline I see is a damaged Mobile
    SAM.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene45.jpg
  narration: Now we know why Dvin had to go. The Boers have sent a sizable fleet into
    the Eastern Mediterranean to defend the massive air force attacking Vietnam. Kruger
    has even ordered some carriers to the region to house more planes. At long last,
    a use for these floating strips of asphalt!
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene46.jpg
  narration: The last Texan civilians attempt to flee from Brazil as their military
    escorts are wiped out. Meanwhile, Brazil has established Laredo as a naval base.
    Now that Brazil has finally learned the powers of the navy, where will they look
    next?
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene47.jpg
  narration: This glance at the southern Inuit Empire reveal something telling. San
    Antonio and the other great metropolises of the region have been hard-hit by the
    Great Starvation. Dallas is the only city above 30 population in this slide. At
    least the military is doing great – Ekeuhnick has managed to surround every city
    in the empire with the infamous AI ring of garrison units.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene48.jpg
  narration: The Australian navy, after forcing the Buccaneers to finally make peace,
    are retreating back along the Brazilian coast to the lands from which they came
    with their missiles and airplanes in tow. Brazil’s core is less militarized than
    it should be, so Australian troops have room to take a vacation in their lands.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene49.jpg
  narration: Wow, that is a lot of workers. It seems like Kruger wishes to improve
    every single tile he can lay his hands on. Considering the newfound abundance
    of hydroponic domes in the Sahara, they seem to be doing their job with the efficiency
    we expect from Boer workers.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene50.jpg
  narration: Back in the Arabian Peninsula, the fighting is as intense as ever. Several
    Boer cities are down to 1HP, but Vietnam lacks the melee units to capture them.
    To the dismay of the Boer worker horde (or to their delight, depending on how
    they’re programmed), several Vietnamese paratroopers were dispatched to damage
    the tile improvements in the region.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene51.jpg
  narration: Somehow, Artashat has not fallen, but the Boer forces are steadily marching
    across the Fertile Crescent. To the north, Vietnam flips Carrollton yet again,
    though Siberian biotroopers on its doorstep will surely recapture it soon.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene52.jpg
  narration: And now to our favorite mountain meatgrinder, where Nishapur is close
    to flipping yet again. Will Vietnam overcome the Australian defense and take the
    city? Only time will tell.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene53.jpg
  narration: Korea is slowly looking more and more like Australia as Henry Parkes
    sends more spare units to the region. Somehow, a large number of those units are
    diggers, even though Australia has reached the end of the tech tree. Korea had
    better step up their production game now, otherwise they won’t have any room to
    place their units!
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene54.jpg
  narration: Close to our submarine, we take a glance at the Brazilian outpost of
    Iquique. While their technological development may seem scary if we Babylonians
    want to remain secret, if the Boers didn’t discover our existence, Brazil surely
    won’t.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene55.jpg
  narration: A lone Texan battleship marvels in awe at the sheer size of the Australian
    navy, marking a new beginning in the era of refugee units. Before the hiatus,
    we had many of these lost units floating at sea, though now they are merely the
    units of nation-states. This Texan battleship marks the first refugee unit of
    this new era, one where lost civilizations once again roam the seas.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene56.jpg
  narration: Turning our eyes towards the Australian core, we see an impressive medley
    of units. Hovertanks, biotroopers, Giant Death Robots, robotic infantry, chimeras,
    biodrones and more – if it exists and is not obsolete, Parkes has them. There
    are even some diggers, paratroopers, anti-aircraft guns, and other old units in
    the mix.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene57.jpg
  narration: While Indonesia has fewer ships than the Australian core, every Australian
    land tile in this image is filled with some sort of unit. If they were to declare
    war on Vietnam, Australia could break the long stalemate and finally secure a
    foothold in Asia.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene58.jpg
  narration: If war did break out between these two, the real battleground would be
    China, not Indonesia. The Australian expeditionary force has militarized just
    about the entire Korean border, and the stream of units shows no sign of stopping.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: Image 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene59.jpg
  narration: Compared to China, Korean Yakutia is almost devoid of units. Even Mongolia
    appears to have land superiority over Korea here, though the cities’ combat strengths
    are nothing to scoff at.

  narration: And now for a look at Mongolia. They have a full carpet but the units
    are simply subpar. Unless they invest heavily in tech, they will struggle to expand
    even with the weak neighbors that they have.

  narration: Here lies Nedong, the most improbable city on the cylinder. Once founded
    by Tibet in the aftermath of the bloody Finno-Sibir war, Nedong was quickly made
    into a Siberian exclave. Now, it is surrounded by Sweden.

  narration: 'Carthage sticks out like a sore thumb in Boer North Africa, though given
    the friendly relationship between these two powers, a Boer stab seems unlikely
    in the near future. Iceland can continue doing what Iceland does best: controlling
    capitals.'

  narration: Speaking of capitals, Rome is surrounded by a concentration of forces
    usually not seen on the European continent. Iceland seems to be guarding their
    possessions jealously.

  narration: Continuing our tour of Iceland, we take a stop in Iberia to check out
    the situation there. Both parties seem to have a rough parity in the region, though
    neither side has invested much in militarizing the peninsula.

  narration: Ireland is green as always, though this time, it is due to a small platoon
    of Australian units sent to Europe. They should consider themselves lucky – few
    Aussie units get to see that distant continent.

  narration: On our last stop before the InfoAddict slides, we see Icelandic Greenland.
    I feel that name describes it well – despite the icy snow cover, Icelandic workers
    have covered much of the island in the green of hydroponics domes.

  narration: Onto the InfoAddict slides! Here we see a graph of military strength.
    Vietnam’s supply of units continues to be exhausted, though for the first time
    since the hiatus, the Boers have eclipsed Australia in military might.

  narration: Here we see the net income of the world’s nations. The Boers are clearly
    on top, though the poor nation at the bottom is most likely Exclavia. You’ll see
    why I say that in a few slides.

  narration: The Boers lead the pack in production as always, though the Inuit, Vietnam,
    and Australia are working to catch up. Farther down the list, Brazil, Iceland,
    Korea, and Sibir all have roughly equal amounts of production that they are using
    to a varying degree of effectiveness. The real loser here is Sweden, whose production
    simply can’t compete with the rest of the top 9. You better get those Finnish
    cities integrated quickly, Gustavus!

  narration: This graph shows the dramatic effects of the Great Starvation. The sudden
    drop in world population is all too apparent here, though the nations of the cylinder
    seem to be recovering as they build Future Worlds buildings in more and more cities.

  narration: We saw the Buccaneer deals last part, though its significance cannot
    be overstated. With this deal, Henry Morgan managed to escape the war without
    giving a city back to Parkes, which is quite the victory for him.

  narration: Australia seems to be getting all the gold they can from these peace
    deals. This combined with the Buccaneer’s peace treaty gives Australia more than
    2000 extra GPT, though considering the number of diggers in the Australian core
    alone, Parkes does not seem eager to use it.
- scene_number: "73"

  narration: And this is why Exclavia is so far in debt. Even though they have no
    way to pay, they are still obliged to pay Kruger almost 1900 GPT. At least they
    only have to deal with it for 10 turns longer.

  narration: Organized religion is finally regaining a foothold in this pot-hiatus
    world. Boer Lutheranism is the most prolific, though Arianism and Catholicism
    are still spreading healthily as well.
- scene_number: "75"
  scene_title: Image 75
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part90-scene75.jpg
  narration: And here’s the religion map. Take note that Catholicism is spreading
    healthily in both Korea and Sibir, though its Australian founders have not done
    much to spread it to the rest of their empire.

  narration: And now for a bonus shot of the Canadian Archipelago. What’s startling
    in this image is that the two halves of the Inuit Empire are still not connected
    by rail. They must rely on shipping in the Northwest Passage to get supplies to
    the south.

  narration: |-
    We wrap up this part with a shot of the Inuit core, one of the most impenetrable fortresses in the cylinder. Only the Boer core and Australian mainland look tougher to conquer. Will we eventually see the day when even these lands are touched by war? Only time will tell!
    This has been an interesting part to narrate. We saw the final days of Texas, while Vietnamese forces are starting to feel the power of attrition. This has been /u/TechnostarBTD5, signing off. See you in the power rankings!
