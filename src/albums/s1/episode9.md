  narration: "<p>Here is the hand-drawn map by /u/Vihreaa. Hot-spots to watch this part are the HRE’s wars, the Nubian coalition, the Goth wars, what remains of Canton’s coalition, and of course the Venezuelan coalition. </p>"

  scene_title: "Perched atop Hadrian’s Wall"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We start off the episode in the Isles, observing what is the first damaged city in one of the many ongoing European wars this part. From the safety of the Great Wall, the Scottish composite bowmen fire potshots at the Manx capital, while in the south the Manx land forces approach St. Andrews. With the Scottish city not even garrisoned at the moment, I somehow have more confidence in the Manx offensive - even if it’s the one hindered by the Great Wall.</p><p></p><p>For a war in the Isles, the seas are strangely calm, as the only naval battle appears to be in the north in the form of a small skirmish.</p>"

  scene_title: "Breach & Clear"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Eastward, on the edge of Europe, the Goth army marches onward, finally breaching the walls of the Golden Horde capital, Sarai Batu. Tokhtamysh has gathered a host of his best men for a glorious last stand, but will it be enough?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the upper-right corner, the Goths begin to slowly realize that they have another enemy to fight, as Ablai Khan’s men systematically surround Ravenna. As we remember from last part, Ravenna has already taken heavy damage, and is likely to fall soon. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps more interestingly, the Parthian settler you barely see on this slide has sat still for dozens of turns at this point. What goes through the heads of those people, I do not know. Maybe they’ve gotten lost in the dunes.</p>"

  scene_title: "Migrational tactics"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>BC bestows upon us an excellent shot of Southern India, home of the Maratha. As the highest ranked Indian civ, Maratha is facing a lot of pressure - and as we know, pressure can mess with a man. Opting to forgo Sri Lanka in favor of more distant islands must be a stress-induced decision. Moving a good dozen units to protect your distant holdings is a more coherent action, but still questionable.</p>"

  scene_title: "On the flip side"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>We return to the Goths with a proper view of their eastern holdings, and indeed it is proven that Ravenna is at 0 HP, with a Kazakh melee unit ready to go once next turn comes. With Ravenna’s fall a foregone conclusion, will the Kazakh hordes march further, or will the attack dissipate beyond Ravenna?</p><p></p><p>On the west side of the Goth realm stands a surprisingly good Muscovite army. Attacking now would be a shot at long-term relevancy for Ivan the Terrible, but does he have what it takes to disprove his moniker? </p>"

  narration: "<p>In Central Europe, Havel continues to desperately funnel troops towards Liberec, his former city, all the while forgetting that melee units are a useful thing to have on the front line. Somewhere in Prague, a general is yelling loudly.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>With Maturin well within his grasp, Toussaint considers sailing forward to Venezuela’s slightly misplaced city of Barcelona, but observant, uh, observers will notice that the Haitian forces have suffered noticeable losses in this war. Sure, Barcelona has only an embarked composite bowman defending it, but when the land approach to the city is one tile wide, and you have only three triremes nearby, even an undefended city poses somewhat a problem. Go away, go away, come back another day!</p>"

  scene_title: "Kamos’ Landing Party"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Enrico stubbornly continues his naval invasion of Algeria, with the capital of the white-and-blue civ still in the yellow.. As we remember from last part, this attack already dispersed once. At least you can’t blame the Venetians for giving up. Including the settler in the attack is a weird choice, though.</p><p></p><p>Just south of the Algerian capital, Mascara still heals from the wounds of war. Peace between Algeria and Songhai might’ve been an excellent decision for the Algerians, as it ensures that the Algerian army is not distracted by Mascara, and is instead able to sit on the Mediterranean coast, firing arrows and rocks weighing less than 90 kg at the invasion fleet. </p>"

  scene_title: "Back, back again"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a single turn, the Goth army brings Sarai Batu down to half health. With any luck, the city will fall next turn, but the melee unit next to the city looks a bit worse for wear. Alaric would do well to bring another one closer, if he’s actually interested in capturing the city.</p><p></p><p>You might notice that Ravenna has not fallen despite my ravings earlier to the contrary. But this simply due to the Kazakh turn not coming along yet, and as such, I maintain my promise that the city will fall. </p><p></p><p>Parthian settler status: Sitting on their hands.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Inevitable, as they say"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>And mere moments later, Ravenna has fallen to the Kazakhs. Immediately thereafter, Ablai Khan orders his men to Divide and Conquer. As in, divide into two separate groups and attack two cities simultaneously. It worked before, right?</p><p></p><p>On the sidebar, we see Shikoku has built Hagia Sophia, giving them a Great Prophet when all the religions have already been founded. In slightly more important news, Nubia has managed to make peace with one of the civs in the coalition - but then again, it’s not like Minos was much of a threat to begin with. </p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Taking lessons from the Venetians"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Coming in sight of another civ fighting the Venezuelans, we have the Nazca, doing its best battling through the small mountain passes of Valencia. A respectable navy of four triremes has come together outside of Valencia as well, but nevertheless, the city seems like it will hold for now. </p><p></p><p>Notable, however, is the settler walking through a mountain pass, seemingly towards Valencia. The spearmen, I hear, are accompanying the settler for self-defense. Self-defense that mostly consists of charging into a Venezuelan formation of spearmen, to be specific. </p>"

  scene_title: "Quebecois seaside resorts"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>We are taken all the way north to Quebec, as a Manx city has been spotted by some Canadians walking by, near the also-recently-settled city of Edmonton. A settling choice rivalling that of the Yup’ik or the Qing in absurdity, Port Erin is a wildcard on the North American continent. Will the Manx go as the Icelandics once did in an alternate reality, or will Canada finally have a city to capture?</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Raving madman"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>A single look at Eastern Mediterranean reveals the grave reality of the Nubian-Minoan peace. In order to appease the Nubians, Malia has been given away in the peace deal, leaving Minoa with one last city. What could’ve possibly driven the Minoans to accept this? Personally, I believe that Minos finally escaped his labyrinth, but not with his sanity intact. </p><p></p><p>Away from the painful disappointments of the Mediterranean, the Libyan-Nubian war presses on. With Palmyra rendered to a non-threat due to terrain, Piye is able to reinforce the western side of his dwindling kingdom. Perhaps he can come out of this war without losing any more cities.</p><p>Coiot: Nubia is the biggest bully!</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Just sack it already"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>As expected, Sarai Batu has fallen to very low health. In equally expected news, the spearman sitting outside the city has also fallen. Please, Alaric, I believe in you! Move that spearman closer!</p><p></p><p>In less stressful news, Zimbabwe has built yet another wonder. This one is Paro Taktsang, and it gives +1 faith and culture from mountain tiles. Specifically, it gives those yields to all workable mountains in Zimbabwe lands. </p><p></p><p>Parthian settler status: assumed to have been eaten by a sandworm.</p>"

  scene_title: "Watery distractions"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Don’t be distracted by the naval skirmishes occuring in the center of the shot here. Point your eyes at the city of Ostrava, in minimal health, with a Turkish swordsman a tile from the city- what do you mean they made peace? The Turks make peace with the Czechs once again without taking Ostrava. I do believe this is the closest they have gotten to capturing the city, so maybe next time they’ll have better luck. Maybe Mehmed will turn his eyes to Malia’s new owner instead?</p><p></p><p>The other relevant peace on this slide is the one between Nazca and Venezuela, meaning the Venezuelan coalition might be falling apart already.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Stepping stones to hope"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Moorish city on Iceland and its German invaders aren’t exactly news, the Viking city on Faroe is! While not as good as its Moorish counterpart, Haugar will hopefully serve as a stepping stone to more distant lands for the Vikings, who have yet to prove they deserve to be called such.</p><p></p><p>Sidebar tells us that Uruguay has declared war on Apache. While clearly too far to from each other do anything, it seems odd and out of place...</p>"

  scene_title: "Settlercon cancelled, triremecon announced"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The next scene reveals the true nature of the declaration of war on Apache. Yup’ik has also declared war on the Apache, hinting at a coalition war. And while Yup’ik are just as unlikely to deal damage to the Apache, there is a very real chance that someone closer to them joins the coalition. </p><p></p><p>For now, the only victim of the ‘coalition’ war is an Apache scout, stuck in the arctic wastes, with the Yup’ik army on one side and the freezing sea on the other. But hey, at least he gets to view the Triremecon in his last moments.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Kamos’ settling party"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>And just like that, the Venetian invasion has been deflected again. In fact, it was deflected so well that I can’t see a single Venetian trireme here. Only an embarked warrior remains. And the settler from earlier, for whatever reason. If I were you, I’d unembark onto that empty land tile next to you ASAP. </p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "The city...requires a sacrifice. A city...for a city."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>While nothing changes around Sarai Batu, Kazakhs rush to surround Ologicus, forcing me to take back my implication about Ablai Khan not being able to take anything beyond Ravenna. The city looks as good as dead, with Alaric unwilling to reinforce the city, his eyes fixed on the big price, the Golden Horde capital. Will the sacrifice be worth it?</p><p></p><p>Parthian settler status: at this point, probably stuck at home with his harlequin-loving father.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Florida Man’s reign begins here"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>In an effort to outdo Venezuela’s Barcelona, Lavalleja settles a misplaced city of his own in the Lesser Antilles: Florida. A home to weirdos in the future, Lavalleja nevertheless isn’t the only one interested in the Lesser Antilles, as a Kuikuro settler lands nearby as well. This region will be quite the mess in the early game.</p><p></p><p>This particular scene also acts a showing of how Haiti is faring against Venezuela on land. Aided by Uruguay’s navy, the Haitian army has reached the gates of Caracas once again. Whether this strange cooperation will aid either of the two, is up to luck at this point.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Only one civ can smell good"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>In another European war, the battle for Cologne trudges on. With the citadel south of Cologne already pillaged by Moorish bowmen, approaching the city will be much easier. Considering how limited the garrison around the city is, Abd-ar Rahman might just have a chance at taking the city, but he’ll have to play his cards right to achieve such success.</p><p></p><p>This time around, the sidebar gifts us a relevant war, as Songhai declares war on Libya in an attempt at reclaiming honor lost in the Algerian war. </p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Pirates of the Persian Gulf"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Apparently Oman is at war with India. I wouldn’t blame you for forgetting this one. Two triremes are more of a raid than an actual invasion, anyway. I’m starting to think the “bad” in Hyderabad stands for “bad invasion target”. But the Seljuq settler heading into the Indian Ocean, now that’s interesting. </p><p></p><p>The sidebar is kind today, as two civs are angry at Minos for...I don’t know, for being insane? Obviously, only Libya can reach Knossos at this point, but making another enemy out of a neighbor might’ve not been the smartest move.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Shock and Awe"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’m surprised, in all honesty. Bangalore will probably be the first city settled by an Indian civ to fall, and it’s settled across the Himalayas. This is some next level irony right here. </p><p></p><p>Due to my unnatural obsession, I’m going to point out the Evenk Inquisitor on this slide. In case you are not aware, Inquisitors can only do stuff in your own cities. Evenks have a unique that affects inquisitors: it is a UI, available at Philosophy, and it can give inquisitors and missionaries the medic promotion. But Evenks don’t have Philosophy, and even if they did, a unit with medic wouldn’t be useful thousands of miles away from their only front. So why is the inquisitor here? That is all I want to know.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>We return to the Eastern Mediterranean to see just what the Libyan-Minoan war actually means. As it stands, the two navies look fairly equal. A realization has struck me, however, as the Libyan navy strikes Malia instead of bothering to fight the Minoans. And due to the circumstances, Nubia is naturally unable to reinforce the city. Libya might’ve hit jackpot, but they will still need to defend against Songhai’s invasion force, infamous for only being competent in the Saharan desert.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>That’s gonna sting. That’s gonna leave a mark. That looks like it hurt. In a move as baffling and absurd as the peace deals of Hong Kong and Malia, Soctland gives away Glasgow, her biggest city, in a peace deal. It would only sting more if the Great Wall was built in Glasgow, but luckily for the Scots, they can still have their empowered last stands, as the wonder was built in Edinburgh. Regardless of wonders or lack thereof, the Manx have now been offered dominion over the Isles on a silver platter. Time will tell where their might is pointed in the future.</p>"

  scene_title: "Dagger pointed at your heart"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>We finally get to see Libya’s front against Songhai. Libya holds the technological advantage, but the production advantage is obviously Songhai’s. And unlike in the Algerian war, Songhai has its army in the right place - pointed directly at Libya’s capital. Omar Mukhtar might be getting too big for his britches.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Breathing room, figuratively"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>We get a bit of a breather from all the wars by looking at Southern Arabia, the meeting place of Palmyra, Beta Israel and Oman. With the capture of Pedeme, war in this region is no more. But with land running out quickly, especially due to Palmyra,  the peace might be more temporary than it seems.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "On second thought..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Back in the warzone, we get a better look at the desert war here, and it looks like I might’ve been wrong about Songhai knowing where to put its troops. The amount of units they seem to have sent looks very insufficient, meaning Libya might just walk away unpunished from all these wars. This might very well be a turning point for the civ that has otherwise struggled.</p><p></p><p>Exciting news are received through the sidebar, with a vast South American war. Nazca has declared war on Kuikuro once more, and this time, they have made a deal with the devil, as Uruguay has also declared war on the green civ.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Displacement"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Germans have three great generals around their capital and some embarked settlers to the north, Liberec is still in red, Havel still hates using melee units. Don’t you boys know that stagnation is death, especially in the thunderdome that is Europe?</p><p></p><p>In more heartbreaking news, the gifting of Malia seems to have displaced Minoan units all the way into Slovenia. These poor lads will likely never meet their families again. But hey, at least Great Nyatsimba Mutota has built Zimbabwe yet another glorious wonder, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, giving them 3 production for every religion present in the city. It represents their, uh, glory.</p>"

  scene_title: "Will it burn?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>A grand shot at South America reveals to us the circumstances of the Great Amazon War. Lavalleja has raised a veritable horde of soldiers, raring to go. Cahuachi seems less prepared. He’s probably confident in Lavalleja’s ability to solve his problems for him. But this problem is no ordinary problem: Kuikuro is known for being impenetrable fortress in the Amazon. Can the Uruguayan army crack the turtle’s shell? </p>"

  scene_title: "An awfully long last stand"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Ologicus falls to the Kazakhs in background, Tokhtamysh’s last stand intensifies, and in fact, it looks like the Golden Horde army has grown since we last saw it. At this rate, Ablai Khan will capture the city sooner than Alaric can. But, there is no worry! A Goth warrior is approaching the city, only blocked by a horseman. This will be close, very close. </p><p></p><p>Parthian settler status: SETTLED</p>"

  scene_title: "Civ Battle Royale Battle Royale"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a bid for relevancy, Nenets and Evenks announce the first ever Battle Royale on the Cylinder, to be waged between real men, to real death. Shh, nobody tell them. Excited to follow the bloody event, the local Kazakh army has opted to watch the event from Suzak instead of bothering with actual fighting near Ergun.</p><p></p><p>In the background, Iroquois and Poverty Point make peace.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sike"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>You thought Apache was getting coalitioned? Too bad, because it’s actually Yup’ik who’s getting coalitioned, trust. While Metis won’t be able to do much, Haida’s war with Yup’ik is a long awaited one. As you might remember from an earlier scene, Yup’ik do not have much of a navy, at least not near their core. Against a civ with a naval UU, this is a critical mistake. Koyah has done his best to carpet the seas in preparation for this day, and now, it is finally here. The Yup’ik are right to be afraid.</p>"

  scene_title: "Immeasurable disappointment"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>In very anticlimactic fashion, the Goth-Golden Horde war ends right as the war was going to be decided one way or another. As a tribute to Tokhtamysh’s superior diplomatic abilities, it appears that no cities have been given away, either. Tokhtamysh walks away from the war wounded, but not crippled.</p><p></p><p>Alaric does have some good news, though, as Ologicus has somehow flipped back to him. I’d like to know how, in all honesty, as the last time we saw the city, it was well and truly surrounded by Kazakh troops.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode9-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Back in France, the Moors seem oddly eager to repeat the Goth mistakes by shoving only bowmen at the German city. Triremes won’t win you the city. Any of your many melee units could do it. The Germans, seemingly noticing the lack of melee units approaching the city, relax and send a catapult or two to reinforce the city. Tokhtamysh did it, why couldn’t we do it too?</p><p></p><p>In the Far East, Ching Shih removes Sulu from the coalition pestering her. For someone just listening, that probably sounds more menacing than it truly is.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a surprise move, Shikoku is dealing real damage to Macao, earlier deemed to be too hard to approach by sea without naval ranged units. Whether it’s enough or not is questionable, but it is an impressive showing nevertheless, and shows that Shikoku can continue to apply its competence on the seas. Just don’t mind the menacing Qin in the background.</p><p></p><p>Ching Shih removes another civ from the coalition pestering her. This time it’s Tonga. Tonga time is over.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As a sequel to an earlier scene, here is Bangalore actually falling. As said earlier, it is the first city settled by an Indian civ to fall, which is incredible considering the countless wars that have already ravaged the subcontinent. Maybe a foreign power will have better luck making progress here.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We’re given a great shot of the Haida war machine, and oh boy, it does not look good for their northern neighbor. The first victims of the war appear to be the Yup’ik forward settle, Sirenik, and some poor scouts. While a small fleet has been sent to deal with Sirenik, a majority of the warfleet appears to be headed straight for the main prize: the Yup’ik capital, of course.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We’re back in Egypt, where we see that Omar has decided to divide the fleet’s attention between Malia and Minoa. A foolish decision, but Omar is in luck. The Palmyrene army appears to be embarking to cross the Red Sea, becoming a bit of a threat for Nubia again. With the Nubian army starting to dwindle, it’s likely that any units threatening Nuri will be pulled back. Such is Omar’s intense luck - at least so far.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If you forgot the Apache-Aztec war, I will ever-so-slightly judge you, since it had a chance of going somewhere, at least originally. But someone who hasn’t forgotten is Louis Riel, as the Métis declare war on the distracted Apache, joining the pseudo-coalition war. Many have judged Louis’ aggression in the past, but he is out here to prove that North America is his territory, and no one else’s.</p>"

Unlike Kuikuro, the Nazca have been forced to cut down the jungle around the city to make it at least a bit useful, and this move has backfired spectacularly, allowing for an easy approach towards the city. Meanwhile on the Uruguayan front, Kuikuro has learned from the Selk’nam in building up a small navy to abuse Lavalleja’s unwillingness to build one, bringing the hurt to Uruguay.

It is the Great Galleass, and it is very similar to the galleass UU of vanilla Venice, except it also receives a whopping +100% combat bonus against cities, making it quite the city-murdering machine.
