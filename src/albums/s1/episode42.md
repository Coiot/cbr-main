  narration: "<p>Hello and welcome, it’s me again—the one and only Admiral Cloudberg, and this time I’m narrating a real episode instead of an April Fool’s joke! This is actually Endgame, I promise. When we left off, the world had exploded into conflict—now we eagerly move ahead to see how those wars will go for the 29 remaining contestants.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our Babylonian spy satellite first takes us to South America, where a last second push by Venezuela has repelled Uruguay’s brazen attempt to seize Barquisimeto. Only one Uruguayan trireme remains near the city, nowhere near enough to capture it. But Hugo Chavez—predictably, for a leader who denounces everyone he meets—will need to watch his back, because that Moorish declaration of war on the sidebar shows that the coalition against him is growing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over in India, the brief Maratha-Taungoo war comes to an end with no exchange of cities. There is still one war taking place in the subcontinent, however: the Taungoo invasion of Nepal, which is looking a bit more like a Nepalese invasion of Taungoo. Prithvi Narayan has even built a citadel to steal land from Taungoo! That said, Nepal’s troops are very outdated and stand little chance of doing significant damage to Allahabad. If it weren’t for the mountains, Taungoo might be able to crush them easily.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As a big fuck you to the late Richard Seddon, Bob Hawke begins claiming New Zealand for Australia with the settlement of Bunbury. Another settler has landed on North Island as well. Australia is expanding rapidly across the outlying islands where all its pre-E neighbors once lived, but it remains unclear whether the resulting production base will propel them any farther than second place.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Kazakh invasion of Prussia seems to have run up against a wall of resistance as the legendary Frederick rallies his troops to defend Potsdam. A well-placed citadel near Berlin is also giving Frederick a wide avenue through which to move his units toward the front, while also making it much easier to retake Berlin whenever he decides the time for a reconquista is nigh.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Lavelleja seems to have found a new, squishier target in the form of the Nazca. Estaquería is lightly defended and will likely fall, and Chauchilla is a tossup; Cahuachi, however, is probably safe. But if Venezuela were to intervene...</p>"

  scene_title: "I never thought I’d tell an AI to bring more ranged units, but here we are."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs launch another foray toward Potsdam, dealing a nontrivial amount of damage. But Ablai Khan still doesn’t have any ranged units in position and is relying on his unique horseman, the Tolu-Batyr, which like all horsemen has a penalty against cities. At this point, I’d still hand the battle to Prussia, but the horse lord is certainly making a valiant effort.</p><p></p><p>Side note, someone’s unit attacked Konigsberg and immediately died. There’s no way of knowing who it was...</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Maratha has been so slow to settle the subcontinent that Zimbabwe has gone and planted a city in Tamil Nadu. I can’t imagine that the Marathans are pleased, but they’re unlikely to declare war as long as Zimbabwe has significantly more troops, regardless of the fact that they’re on a different continent and the colony is RIGHT THERE, DAMMIT.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shikoku’s rather disorganized attempt to attack Qerrullik has so far yielded no fruit, as the city steadfastly refuses to take any damage. What Shikoku needs here are some triremes in the Sea of Okhotsk to protect its embarked units and beat down the city walls a bit, but with only fresh settles nearby, Sakamoto Ryoma has yet to build any.</p>"

  scene_title: "Remember the... Shelf?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uruguay is making a massive push for Estaquería and has already bombarded the city down to yellow. Out of curiosity, I plugged Estaquería into Google Translate because it sounded like it might be a Spanish word, and Google claimed it means “shelf.” I have my doubts about the accuracy of this translation.</p>"

  scene_title: "It was Zenobia’s birthday, I guess."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Based on the minimap, it seems that Maratha and Palmyra made peace sometimes on turn 131, and Maratha gave away Pune to Palmyra! This is a huge coup for Zenobia, who wasn’t exactly doing great in the war up until this point, but nevertheless walks away with a fully-developed 10-pop city that she otherwise wouldn’t have taken. And what a terrible play by Maratha, geez.</p><p></p><p>Also on this slide, Palmyra and Parthia declare war on India! But due to a strategically placed mountain range, it seems unlikely that either will push through by force. If Hyderabad falls, I bet it will fall by diplomacy—after all, people really seem to like giving random cities to Palmyra.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Piye is not one to give up easily, as he sends another wave of troops toward Chitekete, desperate to regain the city he was so proud to have taken in episode 2. And if he can get reinforcements to the front in a timely manner, he might even succeed!</p>"

  scene_title: "Hiawatha’s Folly"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Iroquois have made the mistake of settling an undefended city in Central America directly in the path of a huge contingent of Venezuelan triremes—and yes, they are still at war. The only thing standing between Garoga and the Venezuelan navy is a small band of Manx triremes, committed to defending Iroquois shores from all invaders—a cursed alliance, to be sure.</p>"

  scene_title: "Blueland?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The first settlers arrive in Greenland, and they don’t belong to the Manx, the Iroquois, or the Vikings—instead, the first colonizers in the frozen North Atlantic are the the Metis and the Sami, neither of whom I would have billed as having a significant presence in the region.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>We once again return to Potsdam, where as far as I can tell nothing has changed. The battle has reached a state of equilibrium, and at this point I expect to see it continue like this until the end of the game!</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Seize the Strait"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Adelaide is firmly in the hands of Taungoo, but this isn’t stopping Bob Hawke from continuing to spread cities across Indonesia like a disease, plopping down new settlements as close together as possible with little regard for strategic value. That said, as long as the Taungoo navy continues to consist of a handful of badly damaged triremes, these cities probably aren’t in danger.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Now this is what I’m talking about! After his previous failure to take Stettin, Illiam Dhone decides to try again, now with a more organized army and a powerful ally in the form of the Moors! Stettin is already taking damage and enemy units are swarming in from two directions. Can Frederick hold off the Manx, Moors, and Kazakhs simultaneously?</p>"

  scene_title: "Going Berserk"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>As you probably saw in the previous slide, we have a showdown in Scandinavia as the Sami declare war on the Vikings! Sami triremes are already smashing into the walls of Nidaros, although there aren’t enough of them to take the city at the moment. The Viking army is also rather scary, as it’s almost completely made out of Berserkers, which replace the Pikeman. That’s not going to end well for those horsemen that Eadni has sent to the front lines.</p><p></p><p>Side note: Moorish Orkney/Shetland is a thing.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Ballad of Chitekete Continues"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Judging by the fact that Chitekete dropped from 5 population to 1, it looks like Nubia managed to flip the city, but was unable to hold onto it. Still, a valiant effort from what can only be described as an underdog. </p><p></p><p>In other news, Benin is settling close in around Nubian lands, and Palmyra has two settlers in the Mediterranean heading god only knows where.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Human Centipede Strategy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Instead of attacking Garoga, Venezuela is trying the interesting and considerably less effective strategy of stretching all their units out into a conga line and sending them one by one into the jaws of a couple of Haida war canoes in Mexico. You do you, I guess.</p><p></p><p>In other news, some ship sightings here confirm that both Venezuela and the Iroquois have researched Compass and unlocked the next generation of boats.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As the Sami continue to push for Nidaros, Ragnar diverts most of his forces to the Baltic Sea for an embarked attack on Aanaar, which is so far making some progress. However, the Vikings’ carpet of Berserkers appears to have thinned out considerably, which is not a good sign for the raiders in orange.</p><p></p><p>As ever, Potsdam is noticeably damaged but still in the green. </p>"

  scene_title: "Not ready to Apaanug-pack it in"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Things start going wrong for Shikoku as Yup’ik mounts an impassioned if desperate attack on Tosa-aki, bringing the city down to red! With only three damaged boats and a horseman, it’s unclear that they can finish the job and take the city, especially considering that it has walls. But if they do capture it, Shikoku’s total lack of triremes in the Pacific will probably ensure that it continues to fly the green and white.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Unsurprisingly, Uruguay’s huge army was eventually able to storm the walls of Estaquería, bringing Cahuachi’s inadvisable cross-continental settlement under Lavalleja’s control. However, the Nazca seem to be holding onto Chauchilla, at least for now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Returning to Europe, it appears that the Kazakhs have managed to batter Potsdam down to red, but they’re running out of Tol-Batyrs and Prussia’s defenses haven’t weakened much if at all. Ablai Khan will need to bring reinforcements in quickly if he wants to capitalize on all his hard work.</p><p></p><p>In the upper left, we can also see that the Vikings have successfully captured Aanaar, and Ragnar has also unlocked his other UU, the Longship, which should help fight back against the Sami naval attacks on his capital.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Having made peace with Venezuela, Louis Riel immediately teams up with Bob Hawke to attack Haida a second time! However, all of Haida’s cities are veritable fortresses, surrounded by mountains or water and protected by walls and large contingents of swordsmen and war canoes. Ironically, the more interesting front in this war might be in Japan, where Haida and Australia have colonies right next to each other.</p>"

  narration: "<p>India’s days may be numbered, as Maratha declares war with a huge carpet of units right at the gates of Delhi! Shivaji did his homework before declaring this war too, having placed several citadels right next to both Indian cities. I honestly wouldn’t give Indira more than about 10 turns to live—she’d better use the time wisely.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over in Japan, Haida’s colony by Mount Fuji is in dire straits as Qin joins the coalition against them. Blue and pink triremes are already gunning for Tanu, and a large contingent of land units is not far behind. At this point Australia will have to work quickly if they want any chance of taking the city.</p><p></p><p>Side note: Shikoku managed to jam a city into IRL Japan in the last possible location.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A wider shot of the Indian Subcontinent gives us a chance to look at Taungoo’s war against Nepal, which has settled into a comfortable stalemate outside Allahabad. Still fielding archers, Nepal has no chance of making any further progress, but Taungoo isn’t exactly pushing them back either.</p>"

  scene_title: "Crusade for the Maghreb"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode42-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>We have another war in the Mediterranean as Palmyra declares war on Benin, with the Iroquois providing moral support. Zenobia has secured open borders with the Moors to help bring troops to North Africa, but it’s still a fairly narrow approach, and Benin’s coastal cities are well fortified. </p><p></p><p>Another thing I’ve noticed over the past several slides is that Canton has been making some smart diplomatic plays. By declaring war on distant targets of coalitions, like Haida and India, Ching Shih is getting a “fought against a common enemy” diplomatic boost with a lot of her powerful neighbors, which should help her survive.</p>"

What an absolute mess—I get the feeling that this isn’t going to end well for either civilization.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, as expected, Prussia has recaptured Potsdam. But it’s down to only 11 combat strength, and the Kazakhs could flip it easily if Frederick doesn’t negotiate a peace treaty soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>After an intense battle, Zimbabwe appears to have recovered Chitekete for good, and is even pushing on toward the former Beninese city of Uselu. Nubia still has a large army in the north that it for some reason hasn’t brought down—they’d better do it soon if they want to keep their current lands out of Zimbabwean hands.</p>"

The city is fortified atop a hill, but against Uruguay’s sheer numbers, there’s little hope that it will hold out.

I mean, its terrain is strong, but is it that strong? Or are the attackers just incompetent? I’m leaning toward... ¿Porque no los dos?</p><p></p><p>On the far side of the screen, we can also see that the Kazakhs have captured Potsdam and are razing it again.

For the first time, a capital has fallen in the subcontinent, and to the surprise of anyone just now joining us, it wasn’t Kathmandu.

  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs have at last succeeded in burning Potsdam, although the border graphics haven’t quite updated yet. More notable, however, is the aftermath of the Sami-Viking peace treaty, where Ragnar appears to have given away Birka to Eadni in exchange for peace. This is absolutely crippling for the Vikings, and I don’t expect them to ever recover. This is also a major turnaround for the Sami, who started the game with a built-in disadvantage due to most of their units teleporting to Siberia.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Palmyrene triremes are slowly beating down the walls of Torcello. Although this is an extremely inefficient means onf conquest, they do have a fairly inexhaustible supply of triremes, and the city has dropped to yellow, so if it works it works I guess. Meanwhile, the Moors have settled the city of Al-Mariyyah on Sardinia to help connect Murano to the rest of their empire, a solid move if their plan is to rule the Mediterranean.</p>"

However, the battle is far from over, as that well-placed catapult and trireme could yet flip it back. Also worth noting is the Shikoku settler in the Bering Sea, which is straying directly into the heart of enemy territory! Go home settler, you’re drunk!</p>"

The job of eliminating India is now left to Palmyra and Parthia, who can only attack through a single tile. However, Parthia has a catapult in position, so if they work together they might be able to grind it down eventually.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Uruguay appears to be struggling to take Chauchilla, as the city is still in the yellow after several turns. The jungle, hills, and rivers surrounding the city make it difficult to capture, and Lavalleja seems to be trying to do so using only cavalry, which aren’t exactly known for their ability to take cities. In the meantime, Venezuela has planted a couple of citadels next to Chauchilla to ensure that Uruguay doesn’t get as much land when the city finally falls.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It’s turn 150, so we get a stats popup from the great Balyonian scientist Ibn Battuta. He has carefully examined the pointiness of each civilization’s sticks, and discovered that the Kazakhs’ sticks are the pointiest, followed closely by Zimbabwe. After that it’s a near five-way tie between Qin, the Iroquois, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Australia.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Excuse me what the fuck? Apparently Venice was still at war with Benin, and a Venetian trireme has managed to snipe Torcello from under the nose of the Palmyrene navy! The city will flip back immediately, but it’s a moral victory regardless. Get this, Venice is still in the game!</p>"

Having said that, the Moors are not exactly doing an impressive job of sieging the city, so Frederick might be out of the woods finally.

  narration: "<p>Venezuela follows up its chain of citadels with an actual declaration of war against the Nazca! Unfortunately it’s probably too late for Chavez to snipe Chauchilla, but his DOW has definitely put Cahuachi in play. A naval flanking attack through the Panama Canal could see Venezuela beating Uruguay to the punch and taking the capital.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Manx have completely surrounded Gadoquat, the city is down to red, and no reinforcements are coming. I’d say Iroquois Scotland is about to be a thing of the past.

Some Venezuelan ships have also arrived at Cahuachi, ensuring that either civ could land the killing blow. And more carracks and galleasses are now making their way south past Ecuador, lending considerable firepower to the Venezuelan side that Uruguay might not be able to match.</p>"

  narration: "<p>At first glance, the Beninese core appears to be really solid, filled with units that can defend it against any incursion. But on further inspection, there’s a critical weakness: besides the coastal cities and Akure, all the cities have very low population with almost no food. These Saharan settlements will only drag Benin down in the long term, leading to what I call the curse of the Sahara—the deadly malaise that befell Songhai, and Mali before it. Benin must be careful to focus on science and avoid making the same mistake.</p>"

Will someone finally blunder into a proper siege setup?</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, we see that Shivaji has declared war on Prithvi Narayan. Nepal faces what is perhaps its greatest test yet: can it withstand the full might of Maratha on the open battlefield?

The Vikings have cobbled together something that could be described as a navy and declared war on Prussia, launching their attack straight for Konigsberg.
