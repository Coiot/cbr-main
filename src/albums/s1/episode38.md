  narration: "<p>Welcome to the Civilization Battle Royale X: Endgame. For those who were not following along with the news regarding the CBRX, there was a crash somewhere along the process which culminated in Episode 37. Rather than allow the game to crash with the amount of civilizations we had to plan for and rebuild the Battle Royale from scratch, the BR has instead been saved from a year long hiatus with the concept of “Endgame.” Now, all 33 surviving civilizations from rump states like Nepal and superpowers like the Iroquois will start from the Ancient or Classical Era. Rather than give everyone an equal playing field, they have been given different bonuses (or lack thereof) based on their performance during the first 37 episodes of the CBRX. Some have even had their capitals relocated based on the damage they sustained throughout the BR. It is not an equal playing field; however, the game has once again become ANYONE’S game. Some strong powers may collapse, whilst others may defy all expectations. This is /u/JMAngelo67, and welcome to Endgame.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This is the world as we know it now. I do not want to dwell on the maps for too long, as this is mainly here for you to visualize the world as a whole this episode. Take note of how barren Oceania is of any civilization, as well as the cluster in Siberia and the empty Germany and France in Europe.</p>"

  narration: "<p>So we are down to thirty three civilizations, but what happened to the last 28? Well, by observing this chart made by /u/Aaron_Lecon, we have the answer in minimalist terms. Let us all take a moment of silence to commemorate those we lost before reaching this point. Specifically Libya.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Iroquois by the end of Episode 37 were the top dog according to the power rankers. I find it hard to disagree with them, with the top 3 being a clear definition far and away from the rest of the cylinder; however, I will note that despite their bonuses from their performance that the Iroquois are no longer necessarily the Top Dog. Indeed, the Iroquois had their time in the sun and may very well lose it. Only time will tell.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We begin in the Frozen North with the Vikings and a glance at the Sami. As should be completely obvious by now, the Vikings are empowered by a large military, whilst the Sami are practically desolate. Their bonuses are not displayed as clearly here, but if you wish to get an idea of the bonuses each civilization has for Endgame, just follow this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zVTibfAc5a2Wg6HHuLTTUklmqiwn1PrErwcaaUM55ko/edit#gid=793763271</p>"

  scene_title: "The War In the North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Though war has not broken out yet, we see Shikoku, a power that had dominated most of Siberia before being attacked by Qin and being forcibly relocated to Siberia, as well as the Khamug Khanate that had had an expansive early empire with no major attacks to become a frontrunner. Also in this slide are the Evenks in Jura, who barely managed to survive in order to have another shot at expanding in the Frozen North and throw a few punches. We also see a game changing amount of great people for Shikoku to give them an early head start. Also note the large number of Sami units cramming into the fray. One wonders if they will be a player in this already crowded region; however, those great people will be useless without a Sami city to establish themselves in.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Haida, who had a more than impressive underdog performance in the early game but a quiet game later on, return to their island home from their beginnings. The Yup’ik meanwhile are the first to two cities in partial thanks to their UU, which can found cities despite being a military unit. Note that the Yup’ik had  been forced on an island in the Bering Strait, and have begun to make headway where the original Yup’ik capital was. They are also one of the four civilizations to found a religion.</p>"

  scene_title: "Illiam is not Dhone Yet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Isle of Mann was not in the best of positions in the original run, as they had a weak Scotland to contend with, later the Vikings, and then an invading Venetian army that stole a city in a peace deal. This time, despite there being a huge army for the Vikings, the Manx have the whole Coal and Iron covered Isles to themselves. What becomes a point of contention for our Triskelion bearing islanders is whether or not their AI will function as well as it had against much stronger opponents. Usually, the Isle of Mann flounders and falls apart due to low aggression and expansion. Will the be the case once again? Or will the production oriented Isle of Mann become a powerhouse?</p>"

  scene_title: "Kazakhstan Number One?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>One of the frontrunners from CBRX did not have an aggressive streak like the Shikoku or the Iroquois, but they still expanded enough to make some serious conquests. Now having even more room to expand than before with extra settlers and a massive force of the Tolu-Batyr horseman UU, the Kazakhs are expected to make way more headway than ever before. VERY NICE!</p>"

  scene_title: "You’d THINK we’d have more room..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Europe is forever cluttered. Since Europe had to be downsized with the rest of the map, civilizations like Venice, which had battered its Central European competition, are now pressed closer to Europe’s perennial rivals, the Goths and Prussia. The Goths definitely have the early advantage with their UUs available and the much larger army, but it could mean nothing if a war does not start, which gives the Prussians and their mid-tech UUs the upper hand. Meanwhile Venice, who shocked everyone by competently settling Italy, attacking the Libyans, HRE, and Czechs, and by getting pieces of the world through peace deals are behind in tech and are worryingly in a position to fail to meet their previously created expectations.</p>"

  scene_title: "SAY! Geronimo!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Apache are back at it again! Arguably one of the most aggressive civilizations failed to show us what their leader Geronimo was capable of when they… Peacefully rested while the Iroquois duked it out with the larger and defenseless Metis. Funky AI bias rolls happen, and we expect the Apache who have the advantage of not having to worry about the Aztecs, Poverty Point, or Haiti to get blocked in. Now, they can REALLY shine. The Iroquois, despite their massive advantage vis-a-vis bonuses, are actually under a considerable threat if Geronimo gets his military into gear. One wonders if this aggression will be their undoing, but it could make them the Top Dog.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Card Says MOOPS!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Moors became not only the Western European Power, but the West African Power as well. After all other Islamic civilizations fell into a pit of incompetence and died horribly, the Moors dug itself out of one of the more isolated starts in the game and grew to control half of the Sahara, France, and battered their attackers. They were always middle of the pack, even amongst the frontrunners. They still have many challenges to overcome, but their impressive performance netted them a significant military and a few extra settlers to start with.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Beast in the Middle East and The Horseman"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyra was always considered strong, but we did not expect them to conquer the whole of the Middle East (minus Egypt) so quickly. They had become a top 5 power in mere moments, set to conquer well into Central Asia, South Asia, or Europe… but they didn’t, oddly enough. Their flame had quieted and dimmed, but it still roared as evidenced by the final siege against Mehmed the Unconquerable. Should they be able to replicate their early success, they should be able to expand further and knock out even more neighbours. Even more powerful ones… Zenobia’s Palmyra aside, Mithridates also returns. They were a premiere power in the extremely early game, managing to knock some cities off of the Kazakhs and the Seljuqs; however, they never made it out of their region, barely surviving by the skin of their teeth. Their power is determined by an early advantage with horse units. Come the obsolescence of horses, Parthia requires a large amount of land to make up for a large portion of their uniques meaning nothing to them. They now have more room to expand with the death of  the Seljuqs, but they are at a disadvantage with the Kazakhs and Palmyra having extra settlers. We shall see if their early advantage means anything from here on out.</p>"

  scene_title: "STAND WITH HONG KONG. Also the Himalayas"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Canton Pirates, which somehow survived with five cities despite never reaching above ten cities total and having one of  the poorest militaries and stats, somehow resisted the onslaught of the massive Qin. The likelihood of the Canton Pirates surviving a Qin attack right now is terribly low, but that is if the Qin attack. Granted, the Qin started the first war in the very first episode of the BR, attacking the Xia. Likewise, the plucky Canton Pirates killed the Xia, stealing the last city of Yu from Qin in said war. Meanwhile to the west was the last place civilization of the BR before Endgame. Nepal has arguably one of the best UAs in the game, and has had an impressive AI in previous encounters. The CBRX was the exception. Now Nepal, which finished episode 37 with only five tiles for their capital city, has NO bonuses whatsoever for their survival. This is it. They are the Underdog. Their survival, and even success is not impossible. But it needs to happen NOW. He is falling behind before the clock even starts turning, and Prithvi Narayan needs to act fast in order to succeed.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Jewel of All Empires."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>India the civilization managed to survive with their original capital and with a semi-decent position, carving themselves back into the jungles of Delhi. Indira Gandhi, the nuke happy leader, will surely need to act just as fast as Nepal needs to. Their early advantages may be essential, as they can easily take out the barren lands of Nepal but cannot necessarily protect themselves from the breakout star of Southern India, Maratha. Maratha, despite being one of the largest civilizations in the early game, never had a significant and successful war for their efforts. Of their significant wars, they only ever grabbed a few cities, and even lost some to the Southeast Tiger of Taungoo, who is in frame to the east of the slide. Maratha, at the very least, has an insane amount of settlers and should form a large empire quite soon… Hopefully.</p>"

  scene_title: "Of Geoglyphs and Socialism"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Nazca are to the south. One may remember that the Nazca have the rare disadvantage of no unique unit; however, they have the ultra powerful Geoglyph UI…! Which they had no opportunity to use in the CBRX! The Geoglyph, despite being a powerful UI, requires a flat desert tile to build it. They are pretty and are a massive boon to every yield as well as being a source of Golden Age points, but only having a maximum of one due to there being only one flat desert tile in South America crippled their growth. They regardless grew into an impressive empire after killing the Kuikuro, battering the Tongan and New Zealand Oceania holding, and being overall a defensive power with the Andes protecting them. The amount of flat desert to the south has been expanded. One wonders if this will be Nazca's saving grace. With the loss of the Kuikuro, which could hold in the Amazon permanently in the longest war in the CBRX, South America may turn more violent as the Jungles are torn down much faster and there is no longer a small civilization to bully. Venezuela lead by Hugo Chavez was in a much better position than most during CBRX. They had to contend with arguably the worst civ in the game (Haiti, which did surprisingly well for once), and a weak Aztecs. They still barely managed to scrape out their gains in each war, but were still massive.  Now that they have no Haitian revolutionaries to forward settle their capital. They now have a great chance at becoming the main rival to Uruguayan expansion.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Sahara’s Last King and Africa’s Last Warlord"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Benin is home to Ewuare. He bested larger and more powerful civilizations despite a poor start, and was an ironclad hellhole for any would be aggressor. Nubia is home to Piye, a hottie with a penchant for sand and arrows. Benin has the entirety of West Africa and the Sahel to take now that the Songhai are gone, and they seem set to take it with their expansion reset to something that is hopefully even better than their previous performance. Nubia meanwhile still can barely hold on in the desert, but have an amazing opportunity to get a running start in the Mediterranean. For fans of the Nubian King, one hopes that they won’t focus so much on archers this time and actually build a competent city taking military.</p>"

  scene_title: "Baba Yetu Mother****ers!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Welcome to the Swahili Coast! One of the superpowers of CBRX, Zimbabwe finds themselves back down to one city once again. Like Nepal, they have one of the best uniques in the game. Unlike Nepal, Zimbabwe was a massive African empire with too few enemies to counter them. Meanwhile, Madagascar had been the second smallest civilization in all of Africa, behind only Libya before it had died. The power dynamic between the two is a huge disparity, but Madagascar gets a strange buff that they did not have before. Despite being defensible in their large island beforehand, Antananarivo was in the center of the island and the civilization could not expand out of Madagascar without settling its coast. Now they are automatically coastal, and may have more expansion opportunities this time. We shall see if that means anything in the long run, but my heart goes out to the Malagasy in their Queen’s attempt at world domination.</p>"

  scene_title: "Welcome to the Outback!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode38-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Australia had a problem in CBRX. A few, actually. Some polyps named Papua, Murri, New Zealand, and Sulu. Three of these polyps have been purged, and the biggest polyp of New Zealand has been transferred to a different continent. Now ALL of the Australian continent is accessible to Bob Hawke and ONLY Bob Hawke… At least, that’s what the Aussies are hoping for. So, what do you want me to say? They have to keep fighting? Sure they do, but they also have the most significant amount of land readily available to them. They have been granted the opportunity to be Number 1 in the Power Rankings just by existing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>New Zealand is here to fight off the enlightened Uruguayans. Can they succeed where the Old God worshipping Selk’nam failed? That has yet to be seen, as the Uruguay bonuses are massive in thanks to consistently being a top 2 power often ranked at Number 1. Unlike most island civilization, though, King Dick Seddon of New Zealand is a powerful underdog capable of taking on the toughest of situations. As a narrator, I will admit that I do not like their chances; however, I will not count them out JUST yet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Despite not getting a proper look at the Metis before the games have truly started (long story short, it was a HUEG civilization that couldn’t fight all too well but survived and got bonuses for being hueg), the first move by both the Apache and the Iroquois is to establish their mutual borders. The Iroquois would have to cross a lot of river before reaching the Apache, but they also have a horde of their UUs. The Apache need to be careful if they want to take on the Iroquois.</p>"

  narration: "<p>India makes the first move over Maratha with a deep forward settle against Maratha. Like the Apache, the fear for India is that their more powerful rival won’t attack them; however, unlike the Apache Maratha has not settled its second city and is far less aggressive than the Iroquois. Could this be the beginning of India’s meteoric rise? Or will it be the beginning of Indira’s end?</p>"

Though there are no units here just yet aside from a damaged Taungoo swordsman, the hordes of units the South Asian Tigers may produce are always going to overwhelm the tiny Nepalese nation.</p>"

  narration: "<p>At last! A shot of the Metis core! Louis Riel settles Saint-Boniface to the south of Batoche, bordering the Apache, but not settling too far from the capital. Could Louis Riel be amping up for a new aggressive tone? Or can the Apache react promptly and punish Louis for his arrogance?  Also, Palmyra builds the Terracotta Army, getting a head start on their military to make up for any lagging behind against the stronger civs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Berlin is equidistant between Konigsberg, the Prussian capital, and Arnheimar, the Gothic capital. This move harkens to my earlier comment: If the Goths declare war now, they will have a great amount of momentum before facing a larger threat. If they do not, the Prussians will have the advantage.

  narration: "<p>Maracaibo is settled south, unlike the original Maracaibo which was settled westward towards the Panamanian Isthmus. I have to say, this move is probably the better of the early moves Venezuela can take. It is better to establish yourself in South America to limit Uruguay’s settling potential as opposed to building a large empire in barren lands first.</p>"

What a shame, as Piye chose to settle the Red Sea rather than the arguable more valuable Mediterrranean. Zenobia, meanwhile, settles Antioch in the second most fertile part of the Levant on the coast of the Mediterranean. Though Nubia can move for the Arabian Peninsula, Palmyra can much more easily acquire the high yield Balkans and Crete.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Parthia decided to settle conservatively and away from the coast, instead opting for the Caspian Sea. Palmyra settles Circesium, a city which would be invaluable in starting an Asian based navy in the Persian Gulf. What is important to note is that the Goths and Palmyra have declared war on Mithridates; however, also important is the distance between the three civs is a bit too far to call this war significant. For now, we expect that this war will lead to nothing, or perhaps a waste of resources for the three civilizations. Notable aside from the war is a Gothic settler in Anatolia. That may spell trouble for Palmyra… Or the Goths.</p>"

This backstab against India has worked wonders for Maratha, though the Taungoo have seemingly fizzled out for no good reason around India, but are sending a horde of swordsmen Nepal’s way. Is Kathmandu destined to fall? I don’t think I want to find out. Meanwhile, Bob Hawke builds arguably the most important wonder for his civilization in the early game: Petra, making the Outback much more valuable depending on what city it was built in. Less valuable is the wonder built by the Kazakhs, the Gate of the Sun. which provides +15% growth in all cities; however, the majority of boons that it provides to the city and the civilization itself if based on lake tiles, of which there is only one in Kazakh land currently.</p>"

This seems VERY dangerous for our favourite little Kiwis, as they are getting stormed by the Uruguayan horde, which outnumbers most armies on the cylinder, much less Seddon’s. Having a little economic muscle in Cerro Potosi, owned by Auckland, gives New Zealand a decent ramp to grow in some small regard. Losing this, especially so close to Wellington, is fatal to New Zealand. One hopes that Uruguay, which is historically not too powerful in a war in terms of strategic decisions, fails in this offensive. Meanwhile, Shikoku builds the Banaue Rice Terraces which is strictly okay considering the amount of hills in their Siberian territory. Bob Hawke meanwhile builds his second Wonder, the Great Wall, which makes his continent much more defensible until the invention of Dynamite.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It seemed to be a forgone conclusion that the Apache attacking the Metis would result in a loss for the Metis; furthermore, we all seemed to be in agreement that the Apache would declare such a war, not the Metis. We now have observed the success of the Metis in infrastructure and military management, and see that the sudden declaration of war by the Metis was secretly genius. The army is clustered closer to Apache territory, and the Apache’s newest settle of Lepai-nde has no tile improvements to speak of. A simple blitz into this city and Haisndayn will be more than enough for the Metis to call for peace and have a significant empire to start with. Also Venice built Stonehenge. Who cares?</p>"

  narration: "<p>So like I had said earlier, the Shikoku are moving slowly in the Siberian wastes. Whilst the Evenks have yet to settle their second city in spite of having a settler in a decent location, the Khamug capital of Jadaran is getting pounded by Shikoku catapults, with many units in reserve ready to take out the Khanate for a great momentum shift.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Given a strategic blunder, the conquest of Apache land by the Metis is not necessarily a forgone conclusion. Scholars will point to the dispersal of Metis units into an arc. Rather than attacking a single, or indeed just two cities directly, Louis Riel could conquer Apache land. If they fail to do so, then there is no means of upward progression and momentum for these North American actors.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ibn Battuta took on the daunting task of counting every soldier and weighing the mean of armour values to calculate the strength of each army in the world. Thanks Ibn Battuta. We notice that the Qin, who are at war with the Khamugs, have by far the largest military. The Moors and Iroquois are not as large, but are far away enough from the Qin that their military strength’s disparity does not matter. They are therefore powerhouses militarily compared to other civilizations. Uruguay, partially due to a war with New Zealand, are in a surprising 7th with the Vikings only 1 unit score point behind in 8th. This is the early war determination of strength amongst the civilizations. Use this chart for you prediction contests, it could be useful.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Naruhodo… The Khamugs fell to the Shikoku. There will be no Shikokoof THIS episode. Rather, Shikoku have proven to be a true Shikokarel. The Khamugs losing their capital is debilitating. Thankfully for Jamukha, a former top 3 power, he still has a city west of his now former capital. He is not out of the race yet, but he is certainly not in the best position to survive from here. With such a small military, the chance of Khamug recovery is low.</p>"

Ewuare has not established himself in this region, but by crippling Nubian production by taking the forests of the South, he will likely face little resistance should he want to make a push into Nubia in the future.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Barbaric Vikings have one of the largest militaries in the world, but they are under a decent threat. The Sami, in spite of having only one city, are still one of the stronger powers in this early game. Their military rivals the Vikings, but they do not have the production power to make up for it. Because of this, they have brought in a powerful ally. The GOTHS!.... Yeah, it was a bad move. The Goths are too far removed to be of any help in this conflict, especially when they are also at war with the Prussians. Good luck Grandma! You’re going to need it!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Geronimo is failing to defend his territory as the Metis pound on Haisindayin’s doors. For the two units defending the capital, there are eight units right outside the capital ready to reinforce any fallen attackers. Though the Apache would more than  likely survive this episode, their chances at aggressively expanding and fighting their rivals is a flame to be snuffed out. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Nubian Banana Peel is a funny concept. In most situations, the Nubians slip on the banana peel that they had set up. In others, their enemy slips on the banana peel and the Nubians stumble forward into a better position than the one they were in before. The Nubians have presented a paradox. Did Benin slip on the banana peel by settling Uselu so close to Nubia, or did Nubia slip by declaring war on Benin? Nubia’s unit composition, as is their trademark, is heavily ranged focused. As in, the ability of the Nubians to take a city is low; however, Benin has only one warrior in Uselu to defend it, and much of the military has moved elsewhere. Time will tell who has slipped on the banana peel. Also the Moors decided to get in on it because why not?</p>"

On the bright side for the Apache, all the melee units around Haisndayin are about to die, and may not be able to take the city. On the not-so bright side, the Apache military is far removed from Haisndayin, and Metis reinforcements are close behind to take the city regardless of how well the city defends itself.</p>"

Meaning the tiny mountainous city-state is under even greater threat in spite of the Taungoo army absolutely surrounding an insofar undamaged Kathmandu. Not only that, a Nepalese settler is out in the open, ready to be stolen away by the Taungoo. Nepal is struggling in the early game, and I can only pray that they will not end up like the Xia from the pre-Endgame.Also, Maratha settles Pune in Balochistan, meaning that he seems to be settling more westward than eastward so far.
