I for one, am absolutely flawless in my predictions and predicted Shikoku’s rise to power way back when they hadn’t made a single settler.

  narration: "<p>Not even one turn in and the Selk’nam are already toppling. Sadly for Seddon, it seems like he really wasn’t in any position to declare war.

  narration: "<p>Oh my… it seems our little invisible friends have finally bit the bullet, to the Qin! I think this may constitute the longest capital snipe yet.</p><p></p><p>The Nenets definitely had a game, what it was, I’m not really sure. I really would not be the best person to write a eulogy for these guys, I pretty much ignored them as much as 90% of the Cylinder did. It was pretty amazing when they began to settle, but truly they never amounted to much more than a smaller, slightly more fun Yakutia.
