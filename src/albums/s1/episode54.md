  narration: "<p>Hey everyone, it’s Lunar again! I hope you enjoyed the last part. My proofreaders are close friends of mine who I always wanted to get into a part, so I thought I might as well use my Blue Cassette privilege to get them to assist me in this final part. There’s a lot to unpack here, but I implore you to follow along for the brutal personal hell that is late game Civilization 5. My friends joining me on such a journey are Jay and Robert, first time narrators and who honestly have been so supportive of me and my work as I toil away with turn times and crashes. Because we trio-teamed this, I will be noting who is narrating what part in the scene title so as to not break the flow of chaos.Finally, as someone who went through this all, I thank each and everyone of you for guiding us through this journey. This has been an emotional set of months and honestly I’m so happy to be in such a welcoming and open community. Thank you. ^-^</p>"

  narration: "<p>And with a snap of flames and a few thousand Kazakh hovertanks, the eastern Indian front collapses even more. For those hoping for a Zimbabwe hold on India, nothing is likely to save them. Many cities are in the red due to Total War and their core is very fragile. Some nuclear hellfire around the former Marathan capital of Raigad doesn’t spell that these tiles are even worth keeping. Let it go, Zimbabwe. Let it go.</p>"

I swear, the more I look at this, the more I see desperation on both sides. It seems that they sued for peace the turn they were allowed to and are now building their army up. Unless central Europe is full of nexuses then I expect this war to turn Kazakhs’ favor in nine more turns when Total War strikes again.</p>"

Thankfully, it seems the offensive Uruguayan units are limited to a single giant death robot and dozens of air units flying overhead. Said position of air units is a bit risky, but Zimbabwe is desperate to protect their core as enemy units trickle in from all sides. I don’t think safe is a word in their playbook anymore.</p>"

Although, the unseen units off screen might be the deciding factors, so for now at least, Japan is divided by two gigantic powers vying for dominance in the Asian theater. Success here depends almost entirely on how well Moorish units can assault the Kazakh core.</p>"

Do not take this as safety, as with every scene the time until total war is reissued grows ever shorter. Use your time well, Zimbabwe.Also to note, Uruguay is at peace with Iroquois, and the Moors are only fighting the Iroquois. It seems everyone made peace with all their most dangerous adversaries to buy them some more time before the eventual rematch in seven turns.</p>"

I’d think that army would be better used north, Ablai. In other news, wow, Zimbabwe evaporated like water on a barbeque. Their units congregate around the former Omani lands as they retreat to their core, broken and bruised.</p>"

Taking quick advantage, and perhaps purchasing a few units, Uruguay assaults the city of Masikwesi with swaths of nanohive units as their army grows. It seems the power of air warfare wasn’t passed down to Zimbabwe, as almost all units are unharmed. They are at war as we just saw. What’s with the hesitation, Mutota?</p>"

There were so many stories in this part of the world that just disappeared, leaving behind land no god wishes to trek. A fitting end. Also fun fact, Newfoundland was just conquered by the Moors. The navy is slowly but surely winning versus the Iroquois. Also also, the next turn is another wave of Total War.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mutota made a difficult call and submitted to the Kazakhs to give a large buffer state between them and the rampaging Kazakhs. Tactical usage of open borders means they can reinforce their front while providing an ample distraction to the Moors. There’s too much to unpack from these last five turns, so let’s just move on. Damn, though. Clever move.</p>"

Their core is at shooting distance at this point and Astana looks like the prize in the Moor’s eyes. The armies here are full of Great Engineers with no wonders left to build, and workers with no purpose as the battles push deeper and deeper inland. Subtract the civilian units from this image and you have the image of a very, very broken Kazakhs. The clock ticks on and the shadow grows over the Asian mega-empire.</p>"

Whoever comes out of this battle with territory inland might be able to gobble up a large chunk of their empires, but the resources spent to take the broken and, frankly, useless northern Canadian lands will come at the cost of the capital. Let it go, Ablai Khan. I swear, some of these leaders fight with the brutishness and bitterness of elementary students. I guess they have a lot of bottled up rage from millenia in the sub.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Let’s focus on Dhlo-Dhlo. Take a close look: Either Zimbabwe’s got a taste for “exceptionally rare,” or they’re so desperate to siege Bumbusi that they’re pulling any and every unit they've got available. Nice of the Kazakhs to lend Nyatsimba Mutota a storage room to leave that artillery to rot in. If the Moors join in on the fight, then Uruguay can kiss their little nest in East Africa goodbye. Unfortunately for Zimbabwe, the Moors’ influence is spreading south. To expand or maybe to flee?</p>"

Chirik-rabat, Balasagun, Akyrtas, and Ordubazar have been laid to waste, simply ripe for the taking. What did it cost the Moors to create a hook to dig into the Kazakh nation? Wait; JUST Romsa?

  narration: "<p>Continuing down the northern front between the Moors and the Kazakhs, infighting continues to break out, greatly wounding Ecbatana. Zimbabwe’s scathing words in an effort to denounce the Kazakhs might have caused them to keep going purely out of spite, because they’ve begun to push the Moors back via Asaak, Suzak, and Nisa. Impressive as they are, the numbers might not be enough. They’ve exhausted the Kazakh front in an effort to land a few more stabs. Keep that up, and it’ll come to bite them back when they least expect it...</p>"

It’s been a bloody battle for Uruguay, but come high tide, the nexuses and nanohives that they have stationed at the front line will wash away the remains. Hiawatha sweats in his bunker as he might have to consider his days to be numbered. Time’s running out, and if this keeps up, the Iroquois will be swallowed up when the next bomb drops.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Moors seem to be angry about something - Kuchan and Nisa wound up being flipped by the Kazakhs, who have no desire to give it up. In turn though, they snatched Ecbatana for themselves. Now that the Moors have a city inside of the Kazakhs’ nation, they readied themselves to take all of it back, stationing rocket artillery, genoswarms, nanohives, and no less than three nexuses stationed at Sidak and Otrar to go traipsing into Kazakh land. Where the Kazakhs laid their pieces, the Moors decided the best move was to flip the chessboard entirely.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As if flipping the board wasn’t enough, the Moors decided to stomp over to Uruguay and snatch one of their toys as well. The remains of what was once Sangameshwar is flipped into Hisn Ar… you get the picture, leaving the Moors a station to go snatching land after land from two supported fronts. The Pincer method - even in futuristic times, old tactics die hard. Meanwhile, Uruguay is preparing to settle a city in No-Man’s Land, trying to claim back some of the missing grounds from earlier firefights. Eight turns seems like such a long time away, and Uruguay has decided the best thing to do against the forces is… ready themselves another citadel to make more? Surprisingly clever, for a Civ with not much offense nearby a dividing line. Er, dividing land.</p>"

Eight - count them, EIGHT territories have been crushed by the Uruguayan forces, leading giant death robots on ships to claim the lands for the nation to grow. However, Gorkha and Taungoo are very close to falling apart, and the Kazakhs seem exceedingly hungry, or exceedingly desperate to start taking lands for themselves. Do giant death robots dream of autocratic ideals? </p>"

Up north though, the Kazakhs are refusing to settle down, wildly forcing back more and more of the Moors and Moor-er, Uruguay. Looks like the tactic of going berserk and not backing down has been working wonders for the nation, but wrath has a bad habit of burning the civilization that fuels them. Total War looms around the corner, three turns away.</p>"

Workers have been sent off to Karaspan and Canton to rebuild the cities. The robots Gorkha had looming over it by the Kazakhs have just… left — specifically to occupy Pyay, leaving Gorkha to go licking their wounds.

  narration: "<p>Finally, we start to see the Kazakh engine running out of steam. Sure, Ecbatana has been flipped again to the Kazakh side, but with the sheer amount of units being overpowered by the forces that the Moors have brought to the table, a bad omen has started to curl over the nation of Kazakh. The Moors have a very greedy, hungry look in their eyes, and the turning point of Total War means that Ablai Khan has no units ready to fight. This is bad, sure, but the Kazakhs are known for burning the candles at both ends, so surely they can find a way out of the mess they’ve made right? What do you mean there’s no more candles!?</p>"

From Uzkent, to Turkistan, to Almaty, the Moors have been puppeting cities left and right. With units dwindling on the fronts, the key cities here are Hecatompylos and Uzkent, as that is where the nanohives and nexuses will most likely next converge on each other. Now, the inquisition returneth, calling Ablai Khan to the monastery.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here, we see what kind of efforts the Moors are putting forward as they advance not only on the Kazakhs but on Zimbabwe as well. Nexuses and nanohives defend Zimbabwe’s frontline in central Africa, but also...a LOT of artilleries. In fact, they have SO MANY ARTILLERIES! Why does Zimbabwe have so much faith in their artillery to leave it as the only front defender in Chitekite? Well, maybe that’s why the cities on both sides are burning. But other than lots of 0 health cities along both lines and even in modern day Oman and Yemen, those artilleries really are just sparklers in comparison to the big boys waiting in the Moors’ line.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Surely enough, that line in central Russia has been pushed even farther east. The predictions were correct, and the Kazakhs have been pushed back by the Moors. Pretty dominant effort might I say, and while it looks like the two have matched units throughout this scene, they don’t. After all, I don’t think Great Engineers and Great Writers can wield swords and axes without some form of magic to stand toe to toe. And this is Civ, so no magic here, only the raw power of technology.</p>"

The workers in Siberia watch as their leader is taken to the coast, pondering if their leader will be put out to sea for safety as the skittering of genoswarms can be heard in Dogo.

Thankfully though, the forces stretching from Valencia to Santa Lucia and everything behind them are a veritable fortress of power that will be hard to pierce.

For a bulky America, that is BULKY, and the west coast looks good as well if not a little shallow in unit density. The Iroquois are gearing up for something big or looking to outlast, and that is a good effort for either endeavor.</p>"

If it’s allowed to amass XCOM units, then at any time after Uruguay grinds them down, the Moors can take Iroquois much like they took Zimbabwe. This must be known by Abd-ar-Rahman, as already, bombing runs are seen crashing into Schoharie, Ganogeh and adjacent cities. You best be careful, Hiawatha. </p>"

  narration: "<p>With a crack of nuclear bombs and units smashing into the asian coast, there’s little left for Uruguay. The armies that rest in most of the civs’ cores don’t seem to be able to make it to the front in a large enough capacity to change anything. And in absence of naval support, desperate tactics seem to be the way forward. This isn’t a battle anymore. This is a test of survival, and sometimes having pieces is better off than losing it and losing everything. Look at Zimbabwe. They fought valiantly and lost it all just to die with a flip of a switch. Shikoku put all their cards on the table and only made their empire weak enough for the Kazakhs to roll in. Metis pushed as hard as possible to the breaking point only to fail when it matters. Sometimes, exposing your cards can be tantamount to death. Waiting out the clock seems to be the plan now.</p>"

We’ve been going through almost three hundred turns, and we’ve seen great things: The Kazakhs’ collapse earlier, Zimbabwe getting XCOM paradropped in a rather amusing and sudden method. But, the thing we’ve seen the most is the status quo. It’s hard to get excited seeing units amass on a front only to disappear the next turn and not know why. The problem is, I know why. The air force is seriously overbearing on this map. A lot of suborbital bombers have a range of 30 and an impressive 100 combat strength. All it takes is a few turns of realizing they can target units and we have hundreds of turns of build up reduced to ashes. It’s too much to deal with, and thus the gaps in turns increase more and more as the air force grows. This cannot go on forever.</p>"

This modern ranged unit is cool, but lacks a large amount of the things essential in modern warfare. Survivability. Its combat strength is below all other units. In this war, if you get focused by an air force, you die. When I was figuring out how to make stalemates end, the only solution was to increase combat strength and mobility of all units by almost ten times, which was not balanced at all. The air force and bombing runs are that powerful. It turns a thousand combat strength into nothing. And here we are, with a hundred strength units disappearing in a turn.</p>"

At this point, turn times are over three hours per turn with little to nothing happening. No units being built, amassing gold and science for no reason, absolute devastation and a very confused AI. It’s clear this game is over, and that the Moors are the winners. The alternatives of waiting it out, or moving to a smaller map would only delay the inevitable and stall our production line. Speaking of the future...We’re opting to take this ending and move on to greener pastures. As I’ve been recording, the team has been reprogramming civilizations, optimizing game assets and perfecting the ultimate Royale. We’re really excited to move on to a thrilling new game (test runs have been looking promising) and brand-new futures! Season 2 of Civilization Battle Royale X is coming soon!From the entire development team to the all of Blue Cassette, thank you for tuning in to Season 1! I thank Jay and Robert for proofreading the previous part and helping me outright write this part. I wouldn’t make it without you guys, all of you. Thanks. See you soon! - Lunar</p>"
