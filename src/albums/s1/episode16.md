  narration: "<p>Another map that’s been useful in my rankings is my fellow Power Ranker ThyReformer’s map showing off the Objectively Relevant wars in a Subjectively Pretty fashion. It helps me figure out who’s fighting who, and how powerful those civs are.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While Tonga had a brief stint as the top civ this week, Uruguay was just able to muscle through and maintain the #1 spot. More interesting though, is the rest of the top 5, which has been jumbled up from Part 14. Iroquois and Maratha are rising, while the Sami, Metis, and Zimbabwe fall. Will the up and comers keep their new lofty spots, or fall back down? Let’s find out!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Rajapapua starts the episode off right, convincing Bayinnaung to join him in fighting Australia. The main target here for Papua is most likely Bunbury, in large part due to Papua’s strong navy, outfitted with new Frigates and Corsairs. Elsewhere in Australia, the Murri successfully retake their capital from New Zealand.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Last part, the Haida declared war against Korea. And while they have a stronger army on paper, in practice the Koreans are far superior in the present conflict. Tlell has nearly fallen, and while Koyah is trying to get reinforcements to the conflict, it seems unlikely they will make it in time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Moors continue to make headway into North Africa, taking Mascara off of the Songhai. They also seem to have finished laying down the law in the former Algerian capital, which will make it a nice base of operations as this war continues. The Songhai meanwhile, have all but abandoned the front lines, retreating the majority of their forces to Kano and Kukiya.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The victory of the Murri is short lived however, as the forces of Richard Seddon retake Cavanbah. While its possible that the Murri could re-flip the city, Seddon could easily flip it back. Seddon, for his part, is starting to look at Meanjin, the Murri’s new capital. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Brown, Beige, and Burgundy boys and girl are back. I thought this was the same image seen in Episode 15, but no, it’s not. Some populations have shifted (mostly going up), but the majority of it remains the same. Beta Israel has its Agaw Archers, Nubia is on the cusp of being outdated, and Benin is trying to channel the ghost of Minos to make a labyrinth out of his country.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Genghis Khan, the current Elected Emperor, jumps at the chance to knock the Vikings down a peg and claw his empire back up the rankings, and declares war on Ragnar. The Emperor is sending forces to attack Alabur, but the Vikings could wheel around to punish the HRE once they finish off Scotland. </p>"

  narration: "<p>You may have seen Poverty Point declare war on the Aztecs. You may have thought this wasn’t a relevant war. Well joke’s on you, a force of Poverty Point troops has managed to appear in the ruins of a former city, ready to strike at the Aztecs. Tahera also makes peace with the Yu’pik, who join in against the Aztecs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qin take Macao and set it on fire in a fit of rage. While  the Pikemen UU Shikoku have could retake the city, it seems unlikely they’d be able to capture the city back before it burns to the ground. Elsewhere, the Nazca join the Anti Aztec Alliance, mostly due to the lack of shitposts by the Aztecs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ragnar has begun to bring the fight to the HRE, attacking their Iceland colony of Nuremberg. The Vikings have a far larger force out in the North Atlantic, and it seems likely that they could capture this and the nearby Ulm from Genghis if they commit to the war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Now that he's no longer at war with the Apache, Hiawatha can focus his efforts on building up his empire. New cities he makes get bonuses thanks to his UA; The Great Law of Peace. He also starts to invest in the new crossbows that have been sweeping the cylinder, though he has yet to see the value of those “muskratmen” he’s heard about from the Minoan sailor near his shores.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode16-scene20.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>And now we get to see why Ragnar has begun to focus the HRE: Edinburgh has fallen, leaving Scotland at 57th place.Oh Robert, much like Elizabeth and Malachy before you, you had the rough luck of starting on the British Isles. And while he didn’t do awfully at first, his main rivals in the Isle of Man always seemed to do better than him. But Scotland still persevered, building the Great Hadrian’s Wall.Then everything changed when the Scots signed a peace treaty, giving away Glasgow. The loss of that city was something Robert never recovered from, and their eventual death to the Vikings was a long, drawn out process. And while there is a remaining Scottish Army, it won’t be enough to retake the city. So long, Robet, may your return to the sub be swift and painless.F</p>"

  narration: "<p>Now defeated, the remaining Scots make peace with Ragnar, crushing any hope of a revitalized Scotland. In the North Pacific, the Koreans have pushed the Haida back, securing their grip on Tlell. It doesn’t seem likely that Haida can retake the city, but if Korea wants, they could push forward and take more of Koyah’s cities.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Though the HRE still attacks Alabur, Ragnar goes on the offensive and attack Frankfurt Am Main. The city is already in the yellow, and the Vikings show no signs of letting up. But the same can be said of the HRE, who continue to defend the city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Indignant after the fall in the rankings he received last part, Sulu is refocusing on his attack on Dhar. Maratha has a strong hold over these straits, but the loss of this city could change things, and would be embarrassing for the #2 civ</p>"

  scene_title: "Defense of Benghazi"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode16-scene24.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>The Songhai refuse to lose Benghazi, and begin to reinforce the city. They also send a few regiments to try and reclaim Mascara. The Moors, meanwhile, have few melee units in Africa, which would make capturing, or retaking, a city difficult.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Parthia continues to press forward against the Seljuqs, bringing Isfahan down to half health. Seljuq forces are beginning to thin out, though they are supplemented by a few Nepali catapults. Zimbabwe meanwhile, contributes nothing but moral support and a DoW against Nubia.</p>"

  scene_title: "Scots sequestered"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode16-scene26.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>1 spearmen, 5 composite bowmen. A Great Engineer, and 2 Great Generals. This is what remains of the Scottish people, isolated to the remains of Stirling. Sure they aren’t the Lost Legion or the Ashanti Pikeman, but I’m sure this squad of Scots will  inevitably fill that void.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Haida and Taungoo both decide to settle in Hawaii. Shockingly, both settle on opposite sides from where they are, and when they try to settle the other side, both find the other already there. The Shikoku meanwhile, who have been their since Part 14, chuckle at some new potential prey.</p>"

  scene_title: "Going for an Alpha Strike"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode16-scene28.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Beta Israel goes on the offensive, pushing against the borders of Nubia. The Agaw Archers of Beta Israel are weaker than the average comp bowmen, but have the advantage of pillaging enemy tiles and healing, along with additional range. This means they could theoretically take potshots at Meroe until a melee unit is in range to take the city.</p>"

  scene_title: "Vikings Smash!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode16-scene29.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Frankfurt Am Main has nearly fallen to the Vikings, and perhaps would have truly fallen were it not for a pair of Moorish scouts. While its likely the city would be recaptured if Ragnar did take it, it would still be a great blow to Genghis Khan. Elsewhere, Stettin remains in the red, and some far off civs declare war on the Nenets.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode16-scene30.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Parthian units continue to make headway in the war vs the Seljuqs. Most of the combined Nepal/Seljuq army has been pushed back, giving Mithridates a good shot of taking the capital. If he succeeds, it will almost certainly doom the chances of the Seljuqs winning the game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While Shikoku manages to recapture Maaco, the Qin have shifted their attention to Canton. This sort of two front fighting is only being a detriment to Qin. And while the Qin Nu, a crossbow UU, is great vs cities, it does require set-up, which is time his foes can use against Qin.</p>"

  narration: "<p>You may have also seen the big news in the last panel: The Moors and Songhai make peace. While the Moors get to keep Mascara, the Songhai still maintain a decent grip on much of Northwest Africa. All in all, both parties most likely realized that wasting men and resources against one another was ineffective.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Uruguay continues to press the attack against the Kuikuro, and once again, we see units surrounding, but not attacking, the Kuikuro capital. Despite the length of time this war has been going, and the power difference between each civ, we haven’t seen that many captures from Uruguay. Perhaps this push, or their new wonder which give +1 Science from Religious Buildings, will turn it around.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Meanjin continues to take damage, with the Murri defenders being pushed back. Offscreen, the New Zealand capital of Wellington had a whopping 47 population during Turn 230, and its likely to have continued growing. This has lead to several in the PR to politely ask New Zealand to stop having orgies in their capital.</p>"

The Manx have a well sized force of Pikemen and crossbowmen, and while that might be good to fight the HRE, the Moors might be a different story.
