I’m here to use Dawkinzz’s wonderful voice, if you’re watching the video, and we’re starting at Turn 535.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Chicago_Ball gives us a glimpse into an alternate universe where everyone performed according to their Part 1 ranking. There are plenty of differences in this version of the Cylinder, and it serves as a reminder that predictions don’t always come true.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Someone’s bombing Bangalore, though I’m not quite sure who it is. Gothic paratroopers and their friends serve as a second barrier, as if it weren’t already hard enough to get through the rough terrain.</p>"

  scene_title: "Roadblock"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tlacopan continues to teeter on the brink of falling. If Geronimo can sneak in a melee unit, the city is his. The sheer amount of peacekeepers makes it hard, though.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Riel retakes Fort-des-Praries and it’s highly unlikely the Yup’ik can take it back. The masses of foreign roadblocks look like they’re going to stop any further progress in this war. It’s a shame really. I liked how the Yup’ik managed to grab all those northern cities.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene10.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>We get our first look at the Venezuelan Unique Unit, the Tortuga. BC informs me that it replaces the Tank, is much weaker, but a copy is created when it is built. When it runs out of moves, it performs a ranged attack on a nearby enemy unit. It also produces culture when being built. I think this will help Chavez fill his lands and keep foreign units away.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Iroquois core is quite devoid of their troops, but the troops that are there are very advanced, almost completely composed of Future Worlds units. Quite a few Goo drones are present in the area as well.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Cold Goo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene22.jpg

  scene_title: "Western Protectorate"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>We see the western Qin lands in this shot. It’s full of units, and I think the Khamugs and Taungoo are currently on par in terms of units present at the border. Also Nuwakot isn’t falling anytime soon.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene25.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>As I narrate this shot, it’s a still image but if everything goes as planned, this is a GIF-Tastic(™) shot of Orbital Bombers taking out a bunch of units. Dawkinzz, be careful how you pronounce “gif”...</p>"

  narration: "<p>The great Viking navy in the North Sea, full of modern, up-to-date units and an amusingly large amount of sail-powered ships. I even spot a Longship. The Sami have some too, but their excuse is that they can’t get those ships home without open borders.</p>"

  scene_title: "No Need for Artificial Islands"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Unlike the real world, the East Sea is indisputably Burmese, as it should be. These Cantonese with their “two-dash line” around Chu Hoi are just being silly. Bayinnaung doesn’t seem to have the tech to upgrade their navy to Future Worlds units yet, which means that Ching Shih has, in theory, some measure of parity with Taungoo, though she doesn’t seem to be able to upgrade some of her museum-quality units.</p>"

  scene_title: "Not Rhodesia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>That’s…a lot of Zimbabwe Paratroopers. Mutota has a good modern navy and is churning out advanced units as well. They’re in a good position. Reports of ghostly sailing ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope are said to be “heavily exaggerated.”</p>"

  scene_title: "The Southern Indian Ocean"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>I actually forgot this border existed. The Maratha presence south of Australia is a mix of modern and very outdated units. The Aussies have an interesting mix of land and naval units guarding their southern coast.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene33.jpg

  narration: "<p>In international waters, a broad assortment of units sails about, unable to get past the fleets of nearby nations or other stranded ships. Some call them the “White Fleet”, with their faded and sun-bleached banners still flying.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Tonga-Nazca war resumes active status. Only the Nazca have a melee unit anywhere nearby, though. I predict a whole lot of nothing for now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It looks like the Prussians are shooting into the Siberian mists. Perhaps they hope to drive away the ghosts of the tundra? Time will tell if it works.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene75.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Tongans have thinned out the Nazca units, though still with a grand total of zero melee units. I’m staying on my prediction of nothing happening in the near future.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Metis are actually trying to push some more into Yup’ik lands, interestingly. They don’t yet have the units to take the next city, but if they push some more, it could pay off.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh yeah Nubia still exists. They still have a carpet, but it’s very out of date. Only Beta Israel deploys worse tech than them. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene78.jpg
  narration: "<p>Somehow a couple of Selk’nam units have found their way to Haveluloto. That’s good for the Nazca I guess. Sometimes I call the Selk’nam the “Selkies” because it sounds cute. Just like Selk’nam-chan, which is actually the name for the Selk’nam language if anyone was wondering.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Speaking of the Selk’nam, they’ve retaken a city! I’m not going to mention it by name for Dawkinzz’ benefit, just like any other I think are too difficult. I would like to take this moment to thank Dawkinzz for the beautiful audio narration, and to mention that CB is the best, thank you.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We see the northern Kiwi islands. They have a good amount of units floating around, though not a carpet. It is a good mix of melee and ranged, however.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene82.jpg
  narration: "<p>A lot of Madagascan units are floating around in the Atlantic, between Uruguayan cities. There’s a surprising amount of civs represented in this shot. Also the Aztecs and Evenks make peace, while the Sami and Nepal are at war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Nepal makes peace with Maratha and gives away Gorkha. That’s a solid win, if a bit small for Shivaji. I am told that QIn also peaced, but no cities were traded.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene84.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nothing really important happens on the main part of this slide. That’s just the truth, and no ranting Haida citizen will tell me otherwise. The real news is in the sidebar. Benin and the Kazakhs declare war on Beta Israel. Benin might do something since they share a small border. Don’t expect much though.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene85.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Aztecs...still aren’t dead. Last-minute Australian deployments have blocked Apache melee units from attacking the city. I wonder how much longer Montezuma’s luck will last.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Palmyra and the Khamugs declare war on the Seljuks. Nishapur is in the yellow, and Alp Arslan is in real danger now. The Khamugs make peace with the Manx. This is not good for any Seljuk stonks.</p>"

  scene_title: "Doing The Zoomy Thing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene87.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nubia takes Emfraz and look to keep it. Dabat is in a more defensible position and will take much longer to capture. The Beta Israeli navy in the Red Sea will help too. Though the only thing red in the sea is a Cantonese Skirmisher. BC also informs me that this and all other following slides will be zoomed in to avoid crashes when recording.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Haida declare war on the Yup’ik offscreen, and various cities are taking damage. Koyah does have naval superiority, so I don’t expect this to go well for the Minty Bois.</p>"

  scene_title: "Last-Minute Shot"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season01-episode31-scene90.jpg
  narration: "<p>Zenobia has taken Nishapur! The only nearby Seljuk unit is a Skirmisher, which is ranged. I’ll have to call it now. Cue the sad music…</p><p>The Seljuks never settled much in the early game, and their high point was taking Rey and Nizwa, crippling Oman. Sandwiched between strong, expansive neighbors, Alp Arslan never really had a chance. He tried breaking out through the weaker south, but it drew the ire of Zenobia. He settled the Maldives, as a potential retreat, but it was taken away from him. After being turned into a city-state, the once-great city of Nishapur was citadeled on all sides, reducing it to two land tiles by the end. There was hope of you making it to Endgame, but Zenobia put a stop to that distant hope. You will remain in my heart the best Turks of Seabricks for me. Farewell. F.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On our last slide we see multiple Haida cities in the yellow, with Yup’ik melee units charging forward. This is a gamble, and we’ll have to see next time what happens. </p><p>nyway, this is Cardboard, and I’d like to say hi to everyone on the Discord, and all the spinoff communities of the CBR. Five years ago I discovered the Civ Battle Royale, and this became my first real online community. I’ve made plenty of friends and had great times here. I’ve discovered much about myself, and broadened my horizons, far beyond my wildest dreams. I love you all, especially you, yes you know who you people are. This has been a wonderful time, and a wonderful place. Have my virtual hugs too, wherever you are.</p>"
