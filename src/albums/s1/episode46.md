  narration: "<p>Difficult looking screens positioned in a formidable formation. They mock me.</p><p></p><p>Welcome to this week’s jam-packed installment of the Sea Bricks Endgame. The narration for Episode 46 is provided by /u/Bulletproof_Cookie, who’s been following since the start of mk2.1. You may have seen a couple of my “OCs” during the duration of Season 1.</p><p></p><p>We have plenty of everything this week; major wars, irrelevant wars, capital captures, empires reduced to rump states! Almost every remaining civ has something worth talking about this week, so let us begin.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This week’s OC was posted before the previous episode but I’ve decided to draw attention to it given the events that shall transpire this week. If you have not been paying attention to the Power Rankings, Canton’s rank has climbed from the high 50’s all the way back in episode 4 (when they gave away Hong Kong in a peace treaty with the Qin) to 19 40 parts later. This is of course a result of merely being ignored by their closest neighbours for most of this time while other empires slowly or quickly died out.</p><p></p><p>People were joking about their “diplomatic strats” as the countdown to Endgame started, but it has reached a point where Canton’s entire game plan appears to be “Ching Shih wins by doing absolutely nothing”. Of course, they won’t win with this strategy, but maybe they can last long enough for a Top 20/15/10(!) placement before finally meeting their end.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As usual, Vihreaa has provided the sub with a map of the current status of the cylinder as of last Episode. This is the new Hand-Drawn style that has been posted alongside the old style. With 26 of the 61 civs still remaining in play, we can easily see who are the likely contenders to win CBRXS1 at this point. The Kazakhs are the obvious favourite after the last part, with cries of deleting them already making the rounds, but Zimbabwe, Uruguay, Metis, Venezuela, Iroquois, Moors, Benin, Palmyra and Taungoo still have reasonable chances, too.</p>"

Remember when the Khamugs were big favourites around this time to take Asia? When the Apache were still in the running for North America? How about North Africa when Benin were as small as Beta Israel and Songhai were at the peak of their power?</p><p></p><p>(Man, I’m still upset about what happened to Songhai…)</p>"

  narration: "<p>With the traditional opening slides out of the way, let’s dive into this week’s episode, beginning at Turn 271 in the year of our submarine 2110AD. Our first screenshot shows us how Bob Hawke is coping with what I (sadly) suspect is quite a thrashing. The Australian city of Brisbane is under attack by various Zimbabwe and Taungoo naval/land units, and it’s destined to fall much like its southern neighbouring settlement Newcastle if Hawke doesn’t reinforce its defences with units.</p><p></p><p>With things looking bleak, Bob Hawke decides the only sensible thing to do diplomatically in this scenario is to declare a state of war on the Metis alongside the Kazakhs. Those two wars won’t likely have an impact at this point in the game, but narrators have been wrong in the past so I wouldn’t place any bets on it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>THESE two wars, on the other hand…</p><p></p><p>An enraged Ying Zheng, furious that his dream of a unified China has been taken away from him by Ablai Khan, looks back at the Canton settlements that he left to live for thousands of years at his new capital of Geelong, and decides that he’s going to go down with the sinking the ship, it will not be before the Canton bloody Pirates do. A quick diplomatic discussion with Bayinnaung results in the two leaders declaring war on Ching Shih.</p><p></p><p>The Qin may have lost most of their empire, but they still have the navy to take a few Canton cities, at least. The Taungoo are also more than capable of finishing off their red and yellow neighbours. The Canton Pirates may flip Yueyang once or twice before they run out of units, but with all their cities being coastal, Ching Shih will most likely not survive for much longer.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The heated rivalry between Hiawatha and Louis Riel begins a new chapter as the Iroquois declare war against The Metis (whom this narrator likes to pronounce as the “Meh-tece”). Louis has the advantage in land and overall production, but Hiawatha has better production per city, holds a more scientifically advanced empire and, most importantly, a stronger military (though you may not notice that judging from the screenshot and a lot of that military score comes from their fleet). However, the Iroquois are currently struggling from Happiness problems which may harm their military units in combat and result in cities being razed rather than puppeted. So this may have not been the best time to start up the war machine, again.</p>"

They don’t appear to have enough units to continue their conquest judging from this screenshot, but they could easily make peace now to rebuild for a second invasion later. It is also worth reminding everyone that Australia does have the Great Wall wonder, meaning enemy land units will only move one title each turn inside Aussie territory until THEY discover Dynamite (not their enemies).</p>"

Battleford has already fallen, and Frog Lake is surrounded by enemy units. The Iroquiois will also surely pound Frenchman’s Butte (I am a mature narrator).</p><p></p><p>Actually, I take that back. Maybe Hiawatha doesn’t want control of Greenland (yet), as he has chosen to raze Battleford rather than puppeting it. If the Iroquois don’t sort out their happiness problems soon, they won’t benefit much from his war.</p>"

Yueyang doesn’t appear to have flipped yet, but the city is starving based on the population drop.</p><p></p><p>I see a Yup’ik Swordsman in Japan.

(Or would this make this the New World? Because if the New World is exploring the new lands, wouldn’t that make the New World the Old World? And then what about the pre-endgame world Pedro destroyed? Would that make the New World the New Old World and the Old World the New New World?)</p><p></p><p>*Inception Sound Effect intensifies*</p><p></p><p>Also, Australia peaced out with Uruguay.

Palmyra also made peace with Prussia once it became apparent there was no clear path to invade Prussia thanks to the peacekeepers (and also to deny Frederick from reclaiming Berlin).</p>"

Ryoma may not be in contention to win the whole thing anymore, but his empire is still able eliminate one or two more rump states (I’m looking at you, Apaanugpak).</p><p></p><p>The Haida were never a top contender in the cylinder, but there were occasions earlier in the season where they had the potential to become a large empire if they had used their armada to conquer the coasts of North and Central America and work their way inland from there. They never truly reached this potential and most of their conquests came from Yup’ik and Korean territory. This failure to create a large empire resulted in relatively small starting bonuses heading into Endgame, which led to any settlements made on mainland America being taken away from them by the Metis. Overall, a somewhat average showing for a civ that some experts considered the 47th best civ before Episode 1.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Part 0 Power Rankings, how many people would have guessed the Yup’ik to make the final 3 in North America? There were many who expected them to die out quickly yet they have outlived a majority of the starting 61 civs. Sadly, the two remaining behemoths in North America are probably not going anytime, soon.</p>"

One last thing I wish to point out for those of you interested in narrating for Season 2.
