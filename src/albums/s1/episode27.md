  narration: "<p>Hey paisanos, welcome to another episode of the Civ Battle Royale! My name is /u/vivalahomestar, otherwise known as Vivala. I’m an occasional poster on both the sub and discord, but I’m probably best known for creating the mod for our resident thiccbois, the Métis. I’ll try my best to keep my extreme bias locked away. Anywho, let’s get started!</p>"

  narration: "<p>As always, /u/Vihreaa provides us with a map faster than many of us can process the part’s events. Compared to Episode 25, you can see the smaller empires start to disappear. Qing, the Aztecs, and the Kuikuro all lost major chunks of territory, and Canton and the Golden Horde are being citadeled. </p>"

  narration: "<p>For our second map, I’d like to <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1gzIX9l90n26EVACnXCbp6sYwpeBnH2dw&ll=41.137913537649894%2C25.1196143214396&z=3'>draw attention to the Lore Map</a>, created by LacsiraxAriscal and wthrudoin. This map has everything from founding dates to peak population and irl location. But the coolest part is the fact that practically every single city was given a bit of lore (as the name suggests). My favorites include a justification for how a city on the coast of Greenland got named Green Lake and how the Palmyran city of Gerasa grew wealthy by selling weapons to both sides of the Gothic-Horde wars. Great stuff.</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Uruguay will be back next week,” they said. “Putting them at #2 was a mistake,” they said. Well look who’s back to laugh at those claims: the Iroquois! While I haven’t seen the slide itself at the time of writing, I can only assume this is due to the Iroquois’ stellar production and prowess in war. Sure, Uruguay could theoretically break out to the north if the Kuikuro fall, but the Iroquois are currently making actual gains in the war against the Apache. That’s not to say Uruguay isn’t terrifying, just that the Iroquois are even more so.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We open in the heart of the Amazon. After surviving thousands of years of warfare against the Great Guay, the Kuikuro may be facing their end. Nazcan planes and artillery have bombarded the final stronghold of Heulugihiti into the red. That being said, Kuikuro units surround the city, and there are only a few Nazcan melee units at the front. This will be a tough situation to get out of, but if anyone can, it’s the Kuikuro.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We return to the Goth-Prussian War and find Vladimir more or less how we found it at the end of last episode, albeit with both sides’ armies looking a bit thinned out. I think the Goths are the stronger of the two right now, especially since they have 18 planes right at the front, but it’s a little hard to gauge their strength because there’s so many Great People mixed in. Seriously, I counted roughly 7 Gothic generals on this slide. Alaric better hope Algerian levels of General spam don’t lead to Algerian levels of success. Meanwhile, Uruguay buffs its already ludicrous science and happiness with the Hubble Space Telescope and Sky Tower.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With over a fourth of the world at war with them, the Selk’nam start to worry that maybe they’ve taken the whole “eldritch worship” schtick a bit too far. “Guys no, you don’t get it!” a Selk’nam sailor shouted as Kiwi pirates began boarding their ship. “It’s a coming of age thing! We dress up like spirits so boys can fight us and become men!” But the New Zealanders don’t speak Ona, so they just shoot them before proudly declaring they’ve saved the world and returning to their ship.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here’s a good look at the recently de-Iroquois’d Caribbean. Uruguay is making quick work of filling its oceanic claims with units, both naval and embarked. Haiti has an admittedly outdated carpet. It seems dense enough that they could give Venezuela trouble for a while if they went to war, but nothing that could save them from ultimately being destroyed by their neighbors.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ablai Khan joins the coalition of leaders who are 100% convinced Cthulhu is real, officially dubbed Leaders Opposed to Violent, Evil Creatures and Resisting All Forms of Terror (or L.O.V.E.C.R.A.F.T. for short).</p>"

  scene_title: "A Fair and Balanced Look at the Pacific Northwest"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene10.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>War rages between the Haida and the Greatest Civ in the Game- er, I mean between the Haida and the Métis. Louis Riel has successfully managed to capture Dadens, and with only two Haidan units anywhere near the city, it looks like he’ll keep it for the time being. However, this looks to be the end of Riel’s western campaign. While the Haidan land army is almost nonexistent and the combination of the Métis front line and air force may be enough to flip one more city, there is no way Riel can take on that monster of a navy. Speaking of, Koyah really needs to start making good use of that navy if he wants to keep relevant. Maybe that war with Korea will give him enough of a foothold in Asia to start going wild.</p>"

  scene_title: "Scourge of the South Sea"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene11.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p> “The Admiral told us the world wanted us dead, so it was time to take what we could to shield the Motherland. He told us it would be easy. Get some island outposts to quickly surrender so future generations could launch ships from their harbors. Maybe our fleet would have been enough on our own, but no matter where we go we’re greeted by the same thing: an eerie black flag rising over the horizon, canonfire from all sides, and a panicked rush to safer waters. I fear we won’t take a single city so long as those blasted Kiwis lurk about the Pacific.” - Journal of a Selk’nam sailor found washed up in Tonga.</p>"

  scene_title: "Semien’s Seen Beta Days"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene12.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Beta Israel prepares to take back Wolleka with a Rifleman as Gondar takes damage for what may be the first time. The Beta Israeli core has always benefited from the protection of the African Great Lakes and the mountainous Ethiopian Highlands, but Zimbabwe can now bypass that with the power of parachutes. That, plus the lack of units in irl Somalia gives me little confidence in Gudit’s ability to make a comeback. Mutota figures he may as well join L.O.V.E.C.R.A.F.T. to offset all the penalties he’s receiving for his northern conquests.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Great Prairie"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene13.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Here we get a nice shot of the Métis core and (get ready for this shocking revelation) it’s mostly devoid of troops. Riel isn’t exactly known for carpeting, and with his army currently focused on charging into the Pacific, there’s not much left to fill the core. That shouldn’t be a huge problem for the Métis right now, however, as the Iroquois are on friendly enough terms to have open borders, and the Apache are busy with the Iroquois.</p>"

  scene_title: "Westward Expansion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene14.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Speaking of the Iroquois, let’s look at the southern portion of their empire! Soon to be incorporated into said empire are Shish-inday, which is about to be pincered by well over a dozen units, and Chuuk’anen, which is firmly in the black. Like the Métis, the Iroquois actual core is looking a bit sparse (though still more modern and militarized than Riel’s prarielands), since the bulk of the Iroquois army is trying its darndest to wipe the Apache off the map. Also, look at the size of those cities! Monteal and Tchihende both sit at 50 pop, and Schoharie has a whopping 66! It’s no wonder the Iroquois now have the top production on the cylinder.</p>"

  scene_title: "Himalayan Hiccup"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene15.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Not only have the Khamugs failed to make any progress towards capturing Calcutta and Jaipur, but India actually looks like it has a chance to retake Madurai. To be fair, it’s hard to expect much from the Khamugs here when they’re fighting in cities barely connected to the rest of their empire which are located in the most mountainous terrain on the cylinder. Quit while you’re ahead, Jamukha. Those cities aren’t falling until you either heavily invest in paratroopers/X-coms or manage to take a bite out of the southern Kazakh empire.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Riel reveals that he’s discovered nuclear weapons. It’s all part of his plan to take on the Iroquois and retake his title as thiccest civ in North America.</p>"

  scene_title: "Adrift and Afraid"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene16.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>“After a decade of fighting, it feels like we finally got a handle on the Kiwi menace. They are still a threat, but we are fairly certain we outnumber them in this region. The Admiral says that if we just keep fighting, we’ll be rid of them soon. By Kénos I hope so. I was promised glory for my people, but all I’ve done since setting sail is narrowly avoiding death by sailors of the jolly fern. Even if we do win, what happens? Is our fleet enough to take a city, or will we all be reduced to driftwood by their bombards? Or maybe King Dick will conjure another fleet and slaughter us all. I fear this whole affair will be pointless.” - Journal of a Selk’nam sailor found by a passing Uruguayan fleet</p>"

  scene_title: "Obligatory Moops Joke"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene17.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>You may recall that the Moors were never mentioned last part, and now we can see why: they’re not really doing much. Moorish Africa isn’t exactly carpeted, and the vast majority of Rahman III’s land units here are artillery. Not to mention Mandagascan peacekeepers make up a concerning portion of the units on this slide.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene18.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Jesus Christchurch, look at all those privateers. Something tells me the Selk’nam sailors up north won’t be done with King Dick’s fleets anytime soon. This navy stands (or floats) in stark contrast to the empty Australian coasts. The citizens of Meanjin and Kalgoorlie better watch out when Australia vs. New Zealand IV rolls around. Also, everyone say “Hi!” to the Siempre Squad chilling out around Cavanbah!</p>"

  scene_title: "War Closed Due to Taungoo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene19.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>“The people of Vladimir have suffered enough. It’s time to ‘Goo up the gears of war!” shouts a peacekeeper as his units plunge into Prussian territory. Fortunately for the dignity of his people, that catchphrase never caught on. The peacekeepers haven’t completely stopped the war yet, as Alaric was wise enough to instate closed borders, but they’re certainly making it difficult for both sides to get to the front.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The unhappiness problem that was plaguing the cylinder for so long is long gone for many of our top civs. Uruguay is particularly notable, as they shot from 197 happiness at the end of last part to 275 thanks to the Sky Tower. Zenobia, meanwhile, smiles not because of the happiness of her people, but because of the news from her scientists: Palmyra has developed nukes.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bringing a Boat to a Gunfight"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode27-scene21.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "<p>Venturing back to North America, we get another look at the Apache-Iroquois war. Venezuela is fighting the Iroquois too, and they brought their navy to show they mean business... too bad Jaketown is an inland city. As for the Apache, you can see just how much they’ve been drained by resisting the Iroquois’ advance. They’re producing enough units to avoid a complete collapse, but I don’t see them mounting a comeback any time soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The defense of Heulugihiti is withering away, and several hexes are wide open to take the city from. Anetu takes what might be his last stroll through the jungle, wondering if the Nazca will at least give mercy to the trees. These green gates have kept the cylinder safe for millennia. What a mistake it would be to tear them down.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Riel’s planes have done a great job of bombing Haidan cities into the yellow. He now just has to, you know, actually get a melee unit within range. Also of note: the Métis appear to have open borders with the Apache in addition to the Iroquois, so they can at least keep committing to this campaign without worrying about an invasion from the south.</p>"

  narration: "<p>To bolster its current peacekeeping efforts, Taungoo proposes the World’s Fair. Maybe, if the world could just see human ingenuity at its finest, everyone would decide to stop fighting. Algeria, meanwhile, attempts to use its clout to ban pearls. Other leaders were quoted saying “Wait, what’s an Algeria again?”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Alaric cares about Bayinnaung’s dreams of peace about as much as he does about the lives of Prussians. Which is to say not at all. He flips Vladimir, but brought so few troops with him that Prussia will almost definitely take it back next turn. And with the ‘Goo peacekeepers pushed far north of the front, it looks like the city will flip back and forth for a while.</p>"

  narration: "<p>“I’d never expected to travel this far south, and certainly not while escorted by a group of fascist lumberjacks. But the Emir says this L.O.V.E.C.R.A.F.T. stuff is important, so here we are. The Selk’nam we fought looked terrified. Allah only knows what their dark god has done to their psyches. I saw the towers of a dark city looming over the southern horizon, but the captain says we don’t have the strength to capture it. Good. If I had to stay down here occupying some eldritch necropolis I’d surely freeze to death.” - Journal of a Moorish sailor recovered by the Haitian navy</p>"

It’s worked so far hasn’t it? Anyways, we’re about to make landfall and besides rumors of some troops that can walk on water (pretty sure the boys are just messin’ with me about that) nothing seems too weird. I figure we’ll get a foothold on the continent in no time!” - Letter from a Kiwi sailor</p>"

  narration: "<p>What Uruguay failed to do in thousands of years, the Nazca did in three parts. The final Kuikuro city has fallen, and with no melee units in sight, I can safely say this is it. The Kuikuro played a uniquely important role as a turtle. Whereas most defensive civs lurk in their own corner of the world, staying out of the spotlight until a much more advanced civ takes them out, the Kuikuro had the job of containing the cylinder’s strongest (some would argue overpowered) civ within the continent (with some small exceptions). If the Nazca are smart, they will honor the Kuikuro’s legacy by letting the jade gates of the jungle stand for millennia more. If they don’t... well Uruguay will show us just how important the South American turtle really was.</p><p></p><p>F</p>"

The field gun runs for Uruguayan territory, hoping humility will be enough to win Lavalleja’s favor. Anetu, disguised as a drummer, is smuggled out of town with a local band.

Zimbabwe should have an easy time taking it back, at least once they realize helicopters can’t capture cities.

Riel can take it back, but his army grows thinner with every turn and Haida’s coastal defenders are being trained as fast as the Métis guns can kill them. He decides to peace out with the Selk’nam, declaring that “L.O.V.E.C.R.A.F.T. is nothing but a distraction. The real coastal menace is in our backyard!”</p>"

I wish Cthulhu were real, then he could just wipe out New Zealand and let us live in peace.” This call from a Selk’nam sailor to his wife was overheard by Kiwi spies.

Among the citadels and bordergore, you might notice that a couple of their units are sitting in a Gothic exclave, showing that they’re on good enough terms for open borders. For anyone hoping the Goths were going to just finish the job, it looks like you’ll have to keep waiting. And yes, I see that peace notification. We’ll get to it eventually.</p>"

While Geronimo has a solid line of Warbands defending the southern portion of the front, I suspect the reason these cities are still Apache has less to do with the defense and more to do with Hiawatha’s choice to bring mostly bazookas to the front.</p>"

Also advantageous for the Khamugs is the relative emptiness of the former Qing lands. One bit of hope for Qin enthusiasts, however, is their melee unit of choice, the paratrooper, especially since, as we saw in India, the Khamugs struggle with rough terrain.</p>"

The Nenets, well aware of how woefully outdated their muskets are, would prefer to keep it that way. Maybe everyone will just forget about them and they can live in peace for the rest of time.</p>"

Add onto that a swathe of peacekeepers of many nationalities and you get a region that’s impossible to comprehend. Here’s hoping Venice and Palmyra do some spring cleaning soon.

Leveraging its gigantic military, Zimbabwe was able to strike a peace deal that devastated Beta Israel. Gudit lost all three of her cities in irl Somalia, which accounted for a third of her empire at the start of this part. Beta Israel is now left with five cities (assuming Zimbabwe got Kopje back), only two of which are on mainland Africa, and none of which are connected by walkable Beta Israeli territory. There are certainly worse off rumps, but any chance this civ had of staying at all relevant were just crushed by Zimbabwe. </p><p></p><p>And on that depressing note, big thanks to Blue Cassette for letting me narrate this part, Dawkinzz for doing the audio narration (and sorry if this comes out to be super long!), and to you, dear reader, for reading!
