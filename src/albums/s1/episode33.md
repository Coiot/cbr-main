It is I, u/Amelia-likes-birds, previously known as Darkanine! I’ve been a fan of the Royale since Mark I (Inuit can STILL win-you-it!) but as I grew older and more busy, I haven’t been able to follow it as much as I would’ve liked. Well, none of that matters today as I get to present to you all my commentary! *Fangirl squee* I hope you appreciate the amount of Beatles’ and Gorillaz’ references in this part.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Although Cahuachi conquered a not insignificant amount of Oceania, their actual carpet is rather slim. Hope they fix that soonish.</p>"

  narration: "<p>For what it’s worth, it’s rather impressive Selk’nam managed to keep its original capital of Kauwes for this long.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the shot of the east, we see a not too shabby, but unfocused Selk’nam military force. Probably woefully unprepared to wage war with any of their neighbors, but possibly good enough to defend themselves for a bit longer.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Important note that, even though Australia’s military is just...strewn across the map, they still got a strong core going on. Even the moderately mighty New Zealand seems to dwarf in comparison.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the Lumberjack Kings and Queens of the Iroqoius are the most happy people in all of the world with nearly double that of the second highest guy, Seddon. Maybe police states aren’t so bad after all.</p><p></p><p>Well, that was my part. Kinda not expecting it to go down in the all-time greats but I hope it was at east entertaining. I apologize since I was kind of out of my element, I’m an anthropology nerd so I love going into history of the cities and such, but it’s well-past the point that would be insightful.</p><p></p><p>As for shameless plug hour. I’m also a Power Ranker, commentator and audio narrator for the Lefon Royale series, though due to time constraints, I haven’t been able to produce much parts yet. I’m also a super amateur Civ V modder currently working on splitting the Inca Civilization into five different Civs. Do seafaring, horse-riding, ultra-versatile Inca sound fun? If so, look out for that in a million years or so.</p>"
