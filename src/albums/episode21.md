  narration: "<p>I’m projecting into the future here, but it’s entirely unlikely that we will have anybody but Uruguay especially with Zimbabwe falling off the last part. They have the lead with the score for now, but can they use it to win the game?</p>"

  scene_title: "A Peaceful City Burns"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We resume with the Viking conquest of England, the land snipe settle of Wurzburg has been duly set aflame by the Vikings. A far more peaceful fire burns in Ballabeg as the Manx and the Vikings make peace, exchanging  a city to be used as firewood for the Vikings. This sees the end to this Viking invasion with a decisive victory for the Vikings, getting a foothold in England and Ireland. Shame they’re burning their English city.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>And the Pacific theatre continues on! Tatana has been recaptured by the Papua and the Kiwis seem to have thinned out. Does Seddon have any ships or any stamina left in the waters to the right? Only time will tell.</p>"

  scene_title: "Two Fronts On the Same Side"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>The frigid north rumbles forth as the Sami make their next play, attacking the Goths! They’ve already declared and invaded Muscovy and don’t have any units at the Gothic front. A bold and confident move, but we’ll have to see if the Goths can fortify before the army moves in.</p>"

  scene_title: "Proxy War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>In case you might’ve forgotten this largely irrelevant front of the Viking-HRE war, some units have taken damage. The Moors have parked a scary navy next door, but beyond that this doesn’t look like it would go anywhere. </p><p></p><p>In other news, several irrelevant wars are declared.</p>"

  scene_title: "Two Pronged Siege"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Konstantinyye continues to be attacked by the Palmyrans. Palmyra has a scary army but they seem to have sent all their melee units into the Black Sea to either flank a nonexistent Ottoman army or to take Edirne somehow. At this rate, the Czech might just take the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "All Loud on the Eastern Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Prussia declares war on Muscovy! The formation of military units looks like Frederick’s put some thought before declaring war; all the units are nicely lined up to attack with ample melee units. Muscovy should be scared at that competence, but they have quite the carpet but it is entirely melee. Hopefully their UUs will attack twice to make up for the lack of arrows.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "The Conquest of Denmark"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings flip Frankfurt Am Main, quite a crucial city defensively. There seems to be ample HRE units to flip it back, but if the Vikings manage to hold on to it, it’ll be the staging ground for an invasion of Europe. To the side, Alabur looks like it could fall to a HRE naval attack with those carracks.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Cross-Strait Trebuchets"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Bayinnaung lands a trebuchet on a former citadel and begins throwing 90 kg projectiles over 300 kilometres. Someone didn’t do their conversions properly. Nevertheless, Patkul is dropped to half health by the various siege forces around as Taungoo pounds the city down with only a few units. To the side, we see the Geelong is being attacked by a Sulu musketmen and one Taungoo ship each attempts to take the other Sulu cities. We’ll see if that goes anywhere.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Gothic Gangbang"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>It looks like a poor season for the Goths, after being attacked up north by the Sami and across the world by irrelevant players, Palmyra has joined the fray. They don’t seem to have much of a force, but neither do the Goths. Both players here are stretched in two front wars, and the mountains make it harder to conquer anything.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Crossing the Alps"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>We return to the Venice-HRE war, where the HRE seems to have put more units to defend against. The Venetians have somehow gotten over their inability to go past mountains in the Balkans and have completely carpeted the Alps. The forces look even, but only one of the two is being punched at by the Vikings.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Swip-Swap"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Taungoo and Sulu exchange Geelong for Patkul. Somehow that one Sulu musketmen actually took Geelong back. Bhamo’s lands look devastated but the city is as safe as ever. Sulu doesn’t seem like they can take Patkul back without any units in that area. Meanwhile the Taungoo tactic of attacking every city at once by a bit seems to be paying off by lowering Sulu’s wartime capital and Dungun to half with minimal units.</p><p></p><p>In other news: that Ideology icon is probably Haida going Autocracy.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Whoops"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>That’s embarrassing for Eadni! She’s lost her Muscovite gains that she got through war as her units struggle to make it past the citadel near Nicopolis. The Goths have sure turned it around. </p><p></p><p>In other news, Muscovy made peace with the Sami earlier. It wasn’t in the sidebars, but we see that Muscovy just decided to surrender Velky Ustyug to focus on the Prussians. Out of the corner of my eye, it looks like they’ve made the right decision.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "The Gothic Caucuses"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Disregard what I said about the Palmyra-Goth front, Palmyra seems to have mobilised quite efficiently and look primed to take Majar without much more resistance from the Goths. The Goths in return send two measly ships to Gerasa. </p><p></p><p>To the left, the siege of Konstantiniyye seems to be going nowhere, miraculously for the Ottomans.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Siege the Smol Ones first"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, that’s why. Palmyra has been focusing their efforts to take Ankara, quite successfully. The small 2 population city seems like it will fall, but perhaps flip back. Knossos is entirely secured from any Ottoman dreams and Zenobia continues to attack Konstantiniyye with embarked land units. Good news for Mehmed, though, that one HRE scout won’t be attacking them anymore.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "The Push North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Japan declares war on Korea, finally giving up on attacking the mainland in a roundabout way. The capital of Hanseong is heavily endangered immediately and hit down hard by advanced field guns. Shikoku might get their first capital in this game quick quickly and Korea might be headed to elimination if they don’t secure their core. </p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Goths Dwindling Out"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Goths’ odds to grasp their gains grow grim as the Sami forces breach through the border and Gothic forces disappear into thin air somehow. Perhaps it might have to do with Alaric sending all his troops to capture small snow cities like Yaroslav. </p><p></p><p>In other news: ideologies happening in the corner: we can’t know who exactly in this slide, but 6 more civs take the strident path of Autocracy this part and Australia adopts Freedom. Ew, rights.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Wollon-soon-gone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>What a beautiful day in Australia, the sun is shining, Mutota’s Big Ben  chiming, Kiwi ships are pounding… wait what? Wollongong being attacked by a Kiwi navy who only have two ships left. It looks like it’s about to fall any day now but Australia has some units and some chance to take it back.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Arctic Fleets"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>We’ve gotten so far into modernity that there’s now an active war in the Arctic! The Evenks declare war on the Qing, again with minimal front line and immediately putting their own city of Kislokan in blockade mode. Let’s see how good the AI is. </p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Korean Hopes Diminish"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hanseong drops to red and the melee units have not been destroyed. Even if Korea is able to kill that Curaisser, there’s a privateer and a musketman, the one currently being attacked, left to take the Korean Capital. The units around Korea fray into the territory of being unable to retake it. Truly a nightmare for Seonjo.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "A Temporary Win for Sulu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sulu takes the Taungoo colony of Bhamo, finally sending a melee unit after years and years of shooting at Bhamo. They also flip Geelong back again, but it looks grim for Sulu still. The Taungoo forces close in on Dungun and their wartime capital is about to fall. Newcastle off-screen is also taken for now. </p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "The Ottoman Front Moves"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyran fans will surely be cheering as the Palmyra finally move forward against the ottomans, taking Ankara. It is still flippable, but will most likely remain Palmyran in the end. Furthermore Zenobia has finally learnt not to send her troops into the ocean. Perhaps it was the Venetian troops blocking any hope of attacking Edirne. </p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Shikoku 1 - Korea 0"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>And score! Shikoku has taken the capital of Korea! Hanseong falls...to a worker? In any case, it looks like the Koreans could flip it back but those fieldguns are not going to let the city’s health go up anytime soon. Seonjo flees to Busan and luckily still has a strong core. Shame their capital was disconnected from their main core.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "The Danish Pancakes Continue"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Frankfurt and Alabur flip to the Vikings and the HRE units around do not seem to be thin enough to keep it. Alabur might be safe for a while but Frankfurt will most likely flip very soon. </p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Prime your F’s"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Geelong and Whyalla AND dungun fall to the Taungoo and the lack of melee units make the situation to retake any city dire for the Sulu. Bhamo remains relatively safe for at least one turn, but Jamalul is barely able to escape the impressive simultaneous three-city flip to the former Taungoo city. Something tells me that Bayinnaung won’t let them keep it. With Bhamo in resistance, Sulu won’t have the time to pull a melee unit out to take a city unless there’s peace.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "The Top Dog"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a break to look at the #1 in the tournament this season and just look at those units. I’m sure the Uruguayans  are beside themselves, but as is the case in these tournaments, there is no guarantee just yet. The South American wars have not been able to do anything at all, which is not good for their chances at victory.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Questionable Plays"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Look at all those crossbows. That’s a big OOF play from Sami. They might’ve taken their formerly controlled city of Vologda, but they only have two more melee units to take the bigger prize of Nicopolis and one of them is about to die. The Goths meanwhile might not be able to flip either back if either city falls one more time.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Victory Secured"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Shikoku seem to have consolidated their hold over Hanseong after another flip, but the city is still vulnerable. It’s just the Korean forces have thinned considerably. The navy to the north also looks unfortunate for Seonjo. Shikoku looks posed to take the entire peninsula and Seonjo might flip the capital one more time!</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Tonga Time?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The SPOR has actually predicted that the Tonga-Nazca war might be relevant and it seems like Siaosi has actually gone forward with it. Perhaps invigorated by trans rights, Topara is under attack and there looks to be a stronger Tongan offensive fleet than a Nazca defensive. New Zealand, also at war with the Nazca, are nowhere to be seen.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "The Kiwis cannot stop"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turns out New Zealand had not given up taking out Papua, being ever so close to taking the capital. This time Seddon has launched a strong offensive from all sides onto Hanuabada by landing some cannons into the mix. The large 40 pop city seems poised to fall to fill New Zealand’s bloodlust. Tatana also seems ready to fall quickly. Will Papua even be able to flip it back?</p><p></p><p>In other news: the Goths open their third front by attacking the Golden Horde.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "1453 in 2620 AD"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyran forces knock on the walls of the city of Konstantiniyye with the Ottomans reduced to very small patches of land. It seems slow but Palmyra has the tide of war on their side after capturing and holding onto Ankara.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "The Old and New Fronts"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Old front of Palmyra-Goths have stabilized with a gain for Palmyra. The Goths declared on the Horde but have not seemed to make any moves. Perhaps they were deluded by the promise of a Zimbabwean force taking cities for them? With this and Konstantiniyye, Palmyra has been incredibly competent at fighting on two fronts.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "The F remains primed"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Taungoo land around Bhamo and Sulu’s situation looks entirely hopeless. Not much of the analysis here as changed from before. The remaining Sulu units around the other places seem to have been killed and Taungoo has puppetted all the cities, probably feeding massively into their UA. In other news, the Korean capital flips on the sidebar.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "New Zealand 1, Papua 0"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>New Zealand takes the Papuan capital, gaining Seddon his first capital and destroying Papuan hopes. Papua most likely can’t take back any of the cities on Papua itself and has wisely kept their main forces at bay, seeing if they can rump their way out of this mess. Oceania is being consolidated rather rapidly this part.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Aw Mainz"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Venetian Alpine forces whittle down Mainz and their own numbers, but it seems poised for HRE to lose a city. It’ll be quite a blow to the HRE core and severely threaten Aachen itself, but the HRE have more than enough forces to probably take Mainz back. To the right we see a few Venetians try to attack Brno but without the same might as against Mainz.</p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "A Light Aussie Attack"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the other corner of the cylinder we see one of the fronts of the Great Oceanic War largely ignore: Australia and New Zealand. So far New Zealand has been either attacking the Australian west coast or the Papuans and ignoring their foothold on the continent. Australia sends a few units to try to and take it back, but it seems futile as Hawke’s military strategy seems to have been entirely stumped by one mountain.</p>"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: "It’s Tonga O’Clock"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Tonga-Nazca war moves into greater relevancy and the Tonga ships attack Nazca city of Topara down to red. That navy is nothing to sneeze at. Chances seems rough for the two naval melee units that Nazca have left to take the city back.</p><p></p><p>In other news: Sulu screams in agony and asks Selknam-chan to kill them off.</p>"
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: "An Unexpected Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chavez does a standard long-distance DoW to tell the Selknam that they are bad and forgets that he has Antarctic colonies. The Selknam have sure moved fast in attacking those colonies and the measly Venezuelan defence won’t be any use in this front.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Alabur Cities Secured?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings move into Denmark and seem to have secured Alabur and Frankfurt. There’s still a hope for Frankfurt to be taken back by the HRE but their two naval units in range are growing quite weak and Viking reinforcements have arrived behind. Alabur, meanwhile can get pelted down by the German Frigates, but that caravel will have a hard time taking the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: "F to Sulu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>And just like that Sulu has been eliminated. Starting from a modestly sized rump state at the start of this part and growing strong just a while ago, the brown goo has managed to quickly overflow past Bauang and quickly in a few turns consuming all of Sulu. Sulu will be remembered as the founder of Bogomilism, with their one missionary left, and one of the leaders in technology in the globe, with their fancy unique gun left, who almost got their break against Australia to the south, but got ganked by Taungoo when they forgot to settle the Philippines. Rest in peace, Jamalul. </p>"
- scene_number: 45
  scene_title: "TONGA TIME"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the exact opposite note, get ready to be excited again as Tonga takes the first capture across the Pacific Ocean! Topara is taken from the Nazca and immediately razed by Siaosi. The nearby city of Curis, looks defended but not well enough to be safe. If Tonga doesn’t push on, they might have nothing to show from this war. </p>"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: "Adelaide reburns"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>If you saw the Director’s cut last part (go donate on Patreon to get it earlier), you’d know that Adelaide seemed like it was going to burn down at the start of this part. This time, it looks more certain as those frigates and crossbowman won’t let Australia retake Adelaide. If New Zealand keeps it, it’ll be difficult for Canberra to be defended from a full land invasion.</p>"
- scene_number: 47
  scene_title: "The City of World’s Siege Fire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>Konstantinyye falls to the red as the Palmyran forces continue pushing on the city. The entire Ottoman navy has been decimated, but Ottomans have ample melee units to retake the city. If Palmyra doesn’t replace that Curaisser in front when it dies, it might be hard to actually take the city. </p>"
- scene_number: 48
  scene_title: "The Southern Coast"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>The southern coast of Australia remains defended somehow. Despite the ridiculously sparse nature of the Australian carpet and the seemingly lackluster units around Adelaide, Hawke has somehow sent in enough units to save the Adelaidean residents from sure death.</p>"
- scene_number: 49
  scene_title: "The Northern Coast"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene49.jpg
  narration: "<p>Seddon continues attacking the Australian continent from two sides and somehow seemingly being able to sustain it to some degree. As the New Zealanders move into attacking the now small town of Alice Springs, it seems like the Papuan navy would be able to push them back and keep New Zealand off the Northern Coast. To the north Rajapapua launches an offensive against Tatana with a high chance of taking it back, with little chance of keeping it. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Frigid North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene50.jpg
  narration: "<p>We see a rare glimpse of the Haida-Yupik front, where we see the Haida naval core blocking Yupik off but the Korean and Yupik sea borders blocking Haida from their Asian colonies. </p>"
- scene_number: 51
  scene_title: "Trade of One for One"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene51.jpg
  narration: "<p>New Zealand’s navy disappears as they expend it all to take Alice Springs. Perhaps a smart move by Seddon as Papua has few melee units. Will that Musketman take it back? Papua also takes another small city back as Tatana flips. If New Zealand is able to materialise a navy as quickly as they do in some of these shots, they will be able to take things back. </p><p></p><p>In other news: Shikoku has open borders with New Zealand?</p>"

  narration: "<p>A Shikokuan and Korean ship attack each other at the base of what looks like a new Tongan settlement. It truly is Tonga Time. The Aztecs also look like they are already doing trans-Pacific trade in the Industrial era, good for them.</p><p></p><p>In other news: Sami peace with the HRE, not that it mattered much.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Hordes Hustle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene53.jpg
  narration: "<p>As the Goths were preoccupied defending their northern lands from Eadni, their attack on the Golden Horde has definitely backfired as the Golden Horde manages to mobilise towards Gothic cities. Berea is attacked from the side without the citadel and Sarai Batu is threatened with even more units. </p>"

  scene_title: "Palymra 2 - Ottomans 0"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene54.jpg
  narration: "<p>Palmyra takes a capital city, making it their second capital capture in this war, a first for the Cylinder if I’m not terribly mistaken. The Ottoman capital is pushed into the tiny citadeled city of Bursa with two settlers remaining. However, the presence of melee units near Konstantiniyye make it highly likely to see another flip flop.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This is what happens when you burn all the gains you get in a war: the Manx resettle the lands of Glasgow with the city of Port Erin, another city destroyed in recent conflict. To the side, we see that Frankfurt has been totally secured, or so it seems.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode21-scene56.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the great Selknam nation’s colder frontiers in the ocean. Their core looks decent and their ships look okay,  but they are menaced by the Uruguay to the north.

The Nazca’s capital is quite undefended to oceanic invaders, but the Selknam look to be blocking Siaosi’s attempt, but their presence might help the fleet remain intact by the time they can attack, as ranged units from the mainland attack the ships.

Palmyra seemed to have made the mistake of moving their land army away from the Bosphorus and the only hope for Palmyra to gain this crucial city back are those embarked units.

Hopefully the citizens can defend against the Guay menace. The Kuikoro units seem to be rather thin, but that hasn’t stopped them from defending against the #1 somehow. They remain #1 because they can probably take it.</p><p></p><p>Of personal note: look at that Taungoo Explorer. Was it the one that founded the World Congress this part? Oh yeah, not pictured in this part: Taungoo founds the World Congress. Taungoo proposes Autocracy as the World Ideology and Algeria proposes Scholars in Residence. They sure could use that help.

Their armies have moved at most one tile since we started this part quite a while ago.
