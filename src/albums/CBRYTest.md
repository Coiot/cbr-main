  narration: "<p>Hello everyone and welcome to a hundred turn album of the usual test games I stream on Twitch and Discord. This is for the benefit of everyone who cannot tune into those streams, as well as my own pitch for many of the civs included here for voting. This is also a way to show the sub of what to expect of Endgame, as this game will run on its map, and you'll be able to see the new scale which guarantees there is fighting early and constantly.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Before we begin with the screenshots, I want to give credit to the authors of most of the new gameplay mods included in the tests. First up is whoward, who is the author of the DLL that allows us have 61 battle royales i the first place. Several of his mods are added in these games, including slots for great works in various other buildings to keep the number of active great artists and musicians on the map lower, and a mod that limits a civ's ocean borders to not exceed into deep ocean, thus not having city border extend far into the sea. You can find them them all here: http://www.picknmixmods.com/main/home/home.html</p>"

  narration: "<p>Next is JFD's gameplay mods under the banner Rise to Power (RtP). This was previously known as JFDLC, but has now received a number of new updates and improvements. Not all RtP mods are active here, but chief among them is Cycles of Power and Sovereignty, which takes a civ's innate flavors and biases to direct them towards a series of governments and reforms which gives them added bonuses and match their personalities and in-game situations and choices. They are subtle additions that add a little bit of world-building pieces that the sub can latch onto to launch original content for the sub. One of the mods, Workforces, gives charges to workers (like in Civ VI), and adds a new dynamic for civs wanting to choose between building workers or military throughout the game. It allows greatly reduces the number of workers a civ will build and retain on the map. The most noticeable mod is a UI known as the AI Observer, which displays all the key stats and diplomatic relationships of civs as their turns progress. This is meant more for streams than albums, but you can expect a more compact version of this for next season to add a little more information for those in the audience that do not go head first into the stat sheets all the time.

  narration: "<p>Iska has released a number of gameplay mods of late, and we are greatly interested in some portions of World at War that help religious founders in the early-game. Our games have shown that founding a religion can be quite a determent for civs, but Holy Wars, a component of World at War, allows religious founders to build stronger versions of some melee units in the first few Eras of the game when at war with other religious founders. Any civ with the same religion can participate, and it leads to some early game 'teams' like how we've seen some groupings with ideologies in the late-game. The other component is Reformations, which allows a civ without a religion that captures a holy city the ability to claim all of the conquered religion's bonuses if they finish the Piety social tree, so some religions will not disappear just because their founder is eliminated. You can find World at War here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1737956594</p>"

  narration: "<p>A very special thanks goes to Explosive Watermelon, who has made a variety of utility mods that all go to removing many annoyances to previous royales. Most of these mods are simple, but will go a long way to making the viewing experience better. Many of them are private for now, but she has released a mod that allows range units to stack with melee units (sadly I had an older version at the time of recording and it does not appear here). This makes it so we do not have to see a city surrounded with archers and the single melee unit is having to wait to capture a city. It was cute in 2.0 the first time we saw it, but after 2.1 and S1, we can be sure to welcome no deadlocks happening because melee units care blocked by their own comrades. You can find this mod here: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135520647/myworkshopfiles/?appid=8930</p>"
