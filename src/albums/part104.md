  narration: Hello everyone. This is u/Spaceman9800, here to narrate part 104. As
    this image by u/VictorianCreatures shows, the Boer Empire, which was once thought
    to be unassailable, is being carved up by the other contestants. The blue smoke
    of ruined servers and the Rio de Janeiro Conference herald the partition of Africa,
    and the dawn of a new age for the cylinder. We shall see what the future holds…

  narration: And at the head of the table is Brazil, under Pedro. Until recently,
    Brazil was locked in on the South American continent, and not even in the top
    five. Then Pedro started building XCOMs and Paratroopers and never stopped. Now
    Carnival spreads across the world. But should Pedro and Mini-Pedro be watching
    their back? After all, they should know better than most how the mighty can fall.
    We will see.

  narration: u/DerErlenkonig brings us the tile-accurate map as of the end of last
    part. Brazil isn’t the only one who has expanded at the Boer’s expense, as the
    Orange is indeed being contained. Iceland now has the cylinder surrounded from
    both poles, Sibir is moving down into Afghanistan, Vietnam has acquired Lahore
    and little Ambon has fallen to the Dudes who Doot. But most of the African continent
    is still orange. Skynet gazes from behind the Great Firewall in Pretoria, and
    its logic circuits fill with rage at the encroaching humans…

  narration: u/Spherical_Melon’s map shows the human and robot cost of this war much
    more clearly. Millions of digital minds have been extinguished. Once mighty cities
    are reduced to rubble. Some, like the contested Indian ocean island city of Pathein
    have been erased forever. Man and Machine fight for dominance of the cylinder,
    under the glow of nuclear flare. Let us begin.

  narration: Mali’s long nuclear history is on display here. A pirate GDR surveys
    the devastation, reminiscing about the days when they were the ones nuking this
    region. Without Iceland’s Air support, Brazil’s XCOMs must face the terminators
    alone. I count no planes on the Brazilian side. In contrast, 10 Boer planes crowd
    Kumbi Saleh, and airports elsewhere are also filled to the brim. Or are those
    nukes?
- scene_number: "6"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene06.jpg
  narration: Ciudad de Carman is reclaimed by the Boers as their workers try desperately
    to scrub the glassed Sahara. The hydroponic domes that let the Draka recover from
    the Great Famine are now simply ruined domes in the sand. An embarked biotrooper
    charges Sardinia for some reason.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene07.jpg
  narration: Sibir marches into Persepolis as the Boers reclaim Ecbatana. Finnish
    Batticaloa is looking more like Battered-caloa, though no one here can claim the
    kill. Here we also see the first front of a new war. What started as an effort
    to prevent the rise of the machines now turns into a war between humans, as Brazil
    allies with the Blackfoot against Sweden. A mobile SAM and an XCOM south of Gaza
    are the first combatants of this new war.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene08.jpg
  narration: Here we see one of the two new belligerents. After the War in Vietnam
    didn’t go so well, the (Native) Americans have decided to try Europe instead.
    Their army is outdated, but it is vast, and thanks to some Australian fillings,
    it overflows their borders, landing around the world much like Carnival before
    them.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene09.jpg
  narration: Speaking of Carnival… They’re everywhere! And unlike with the Boers,
    Sweden didn’t close their open borders, so their cities are surrounded. In parts
    of Finland there are more Brazilians than Swedes. This is not looking good for
    Gustavus.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene10.jpg
  narration: Pedro II The Terrible, Autocrat of the Brazilian Empire. At 109 techs
    they are on par with their cybernetic rivals, though they’ve chosen to stay human.
    And to fuel that human emotion of Wrath, they have an army of over 6 million.
    The largest in the world.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene11.jpg
  narration: Gustavus has less than half that number. He too is “The Terrible”...
    I guess when your as bloodthirsty as our cylinder’s leaders are, the moniker is
    somewhat general-purpose.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene12.jpg
  narration: 'Dawkinzz‘s Note: Don‘t sleep on the Blackfoot because they just need
    to tech up and will snowball like Brazil has.'
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene13.jpg
  narration: And as we survey India, the battle of the titans is over. Brazil signs
    peace. A Kimberley GDR shakes its mechanical fist in frustration, realizing that
    they and Sibir are now facing the Boerg alone. A Korean production firm offers
    to sponsor their struggle if they agree to film it as a Mecha Anime. A great musician
    near Agra works on the soundtrack.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene14.jpg
  narration: 'Either Kruger and Pedro already have open borders, or units don’t get
    kicked out when a war ends, because a lot of XCOMs are still vacationing on the
    Arabian peninsula, and Boer carriers loom outside of India. The Swedish mobile
    SAM fights its way northwards. In the South, the city of Helsingborg is the set
    for another anime by the same Korean firm: this one about a cyborg-vampire in
    the employ of a Boer noble family.'
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene15.jpg
  narration: Ecbatan and Artashat have either been captured or traded in the peace
    treaty. With Brazil out, the Boers have also retaken Persepolis from the Siberians.
    Sweden draws first blood, taking Gyumri from the Brazilians.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene16.jpg
  narration: Tarentum was also either captured or traded in the treaty. The density
    of Boer troops is nonzero for once, which may be what prompted the peace. Brazil
    came away with a sizable and easily defensible colony here, a clear win. Panormus
    is all that remains of once mighty Boeurope.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene17.jpg
  narration: All those Buccaneer settlers must be really disappointed nothing got
    nuked off the map here.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene18.jpg
  narration: Had Brazil kept up this war Looma would likely have been theirs. A Vietnamese
    cybersub hides under the Antarctic ice, cursing their allies for dropping out
    now. A Kimberley carrier carries a possibly nuclear payload towards their former
    capital of Wulungarra. A Korean representative of the Anime Corporation (Sponsored
    by Big Carrier) looks on.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene19.jpg
  narration: Can a computer breath a sigh of relief? Evidently yes, as billions of
    digital Boer citizens do just that. Their unprotected core is safe, and it looks
    like they didn’t even have to give up anything important in the peace deal. On
    the Boernet, someone circulates an online petition calling on Kruger to build
    an army. It exceeds 1,500,000 signatures a millisecond after being posted.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene20.jpg
  narration: Varna and Ani also change hands, either conquered or given as a peace
    offering to the cyborgs. Sweden’s core is not so lucky. Gothenburg is in the red,
    Nicaea and Adrianople are in the yellow and other cities are taking damage.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene21.jpg
  narration: So many Brazilians! And more just keep coming from neighbouring lands
    like Sibir. Tampere and Vaasa have already fallen. Karkov, Kuopio and Linkoping
    look to be next. This year was the IRL anniversary of the battle of Stalingrad,
    so its only appropriate that one is raging in the BR as we speak.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene22.jpg
  narration: REYKJAVIK FALLS TO BRAZIL. Well, the one on the Rhine, at least, that
    was Swedish. Berlin also falls. The parts of Germany that are still Yellow are
    in the yellow. Not even Sweden-proper is safe as Stockholm takes some damage.
    In the North Sea, some blackfoot paratroopers join in. “See, we’re contributing!”
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene23.jpg
  narration: Even on the Scandinavian peninsula itself, most of the land units are
    Brazilians or workers. Those Swedish military that are here have taken to the
    sea for some reason.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene24.jpg
  narration: A Persian Privateer looks on as America’s soldiers storm Europe’s beaches.
    Around Vestmannaeyjar, one of the northernmost settlements in the world, Brazilian
    and blackfoot reinforcements mass, ready to storm the beaches.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25

  narration: Hamburg and Munich join Green-many. Who‘s next?
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene26.jpg
  narration: Gyumri is next. Also, Sibir retakes Persepolis. Our Mobile SAM travels
    past Gaza, to reconnect with their comrades in Hebron.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene27.jpg
  narration: Moscow, Kuopio and Kharkov go Green. Sweden is going to need more than
    the worker near Long Xuyen to stop the bleeding.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene28.jpg
  narration: Linkoping has fallen. The rest of Swedish Finland is holding, but Lappeenranta
    and (North) Jyvaskyla are looking rater endangered. There’s a bit more of an army
    here, though nowhere in the Swedish core can match its distant colony of Hebron.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene29.jpg
  narration: 'Pedro: “The Boers are not to be trusted! I mean, how did they convince
    me to sign that peace treaty that was so clearly not in my favor? They must be
    up to something!” Meanwhile the petition on Change. Borg calling for Kruger to
    build an army gathers a few million more signatures, but will he listen?'
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene30.jpg
  narration: Vietnam reforms their religion (Theravada Buddhism) as the Kimberley
    make peace with both of their superpower adversaries.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene31.jpg
  narration: This time the Kimberley kept Ambon in the treaty, ensuring that they
    have actual gains from this war. Sure, it‘s a one-tile island, but you’ve got
    to start somewhere.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene32.jpg
  narration: World congress considers world religion (Catholicism) and Natural Heritage
    sites, two proposals whose history gives them a snowball’s chance in the Australian
    Outback of passing. Hey, at least they’re not trying to ban sugar, spice and everything
    nice this time. When it comes to CBR’s world congress inefficiency is the best
    you can ask for. Other than that, we see Mongolia, one of the few places not covered
    by Carnival. Their army may be old, but unlike Korea and this part of Sibir, they
    actually have one. Speaking of Sibir, why are there 3 Siberian settlers heading
    Eastwards? Do they think Kamchatka is the promised land? Or did they just get
    teleported there because Brazil fills every tile in their homeland?
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene33.jpg
  narration: Antioch, Nicea and Ыngvellir (not sure how to render that character so
    I used a Cyrillic one that looks similar) are conquered. The King of the Jungle
    is soundly defeating the Lion of the North.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene34.jpg
  narration: Stalingrad and Lappeenranta fall. In a glimmer of hope for Sweden supporters,
    Scandinavia proper seems to be clearing of Brazilians though.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene35.jpg
  narration: Sibir and the Boers peace out, leaving I think Vietnam as the last OCPII
    member. Persepolis is traded to Kruger in the peace treaty. Sibir still came out
    of this war with Kabul and several other cities, so Sibir supporters can be happy.
    Perhaps they should consider celebrating by canceling Open Borders with Brazil,
    lest they meet the same fate as Gustavus…
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene36.jpg
  narration: Brazilian troops form a beachhead in Norway. The Blackfoot paratroopers
    are nowhere to be seen, but a Blackfoot GDR floats on the horizon.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene37.jpg
  narration: Poznan, Gothenburg and Minsk join Brazilian Rus. This is probably the
    best carpet this flat and hard-to-control region has ever had. Sibir should really
    be using this opportunity to fill the clearing on their western border with their
    own units…
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene38.jpg
  narration: Another display of just how bad Sibir is at this. Count the settlers!
    I see 24. Mao’s knight looks on from the frozen north, occupying, ironically,
    one of the few settleable spots.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Heathen faith has been going strong in Iceland, spreading throughout
    its core to rival the religions founded earlier in the game. Big Carrier and Carnival
    have also spread throughout this region.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene40.jpg
  narration: All those Kimberley units were bound for the Boers, but you know who
    else is there, at war with the Kimberley and looking rather juicy right now? Finland
    with its honor guard of Afghan mercenaries. Can Jandamarra doot it?
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene41.jpg
  narration: Constantinople and Ohrid are Brazil’s latest trophies. On the bright
    side, the Mobile Sam has rejoined its friends in Hebron. I wonder if Gustavus
    will end up exiled to the Middle East, like Kekkonen before him.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene42.jpg
  narration: Vietnam is also slowly filling with Carnival, though they have some troops
    of their own. I also count 5 settlers.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene43.jpg
  narration: Should Gustavus really be denouncing people right now? Sure Iceland has
    few non-carrier units, but they have planes. Maybe he’s hoping to convince them
    to stop harboring Brazilians?
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene44.jpg
  narration: Of course there’s plenty of places in Europe that already harbor Brazilians.
    Hamburg, Malmo and Lodz are the latest additions to that list. Also wow the Balkans
    are a mess.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene45.jpg
  narration: Tigranocerta falls to Brazil, even as Sweden reclaims Adrianople. I think
    Hebron also flipped.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene46.jpg
  narration: Espoo is the latest Brazilian conquest. I wonder how long until Gustavus
    is forced to start nuking his former territory?
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene47.jpg
  narration: Brazilian troops pour into Scandinavia. There’s a Swedish advanced destroyer
    outside of Espoo, so it‘s nice to know that if Gustavus goes down, he’ll at least
    go down with a decent naval bias.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene48.jpg
  narration: Hawaii bravely states the obvious, but that’s a dangerous thing to do
    when Brazilians surround you. On the other hand, is there anywhere in the cylinder
    they don’t surround now?
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene49.jpg
  narration: The Kimberley close in on Batticaloa.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene50.jpg
  narration: Malamo and Hamburg are retaken. Can Gustavus turn the tide?
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene51.jpg
  narration: I want to say there’s more Swedish units here now, but sadly the Advanced
    destroyer isn’t amongst them. Malamo flips back to Brazil. Also, look at all that
    smoke in Sweden. Those Brazilian XCOMs must be doing some pillaging.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene52.jpg
  narration: Australia fails to make Catholicism the World Religion. This may in part
    be because even many of their own citizens follow Theravada or Pantheon, not Catholicism.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene53.jpg
  narration: 'In the bottom right you can see the reason we’re being shown Kruger’s
    stats: He’s joined the attack on Sweden. Kruger’s army is now only the 6th largest
    in the world, but the Boers are still the happiest, most scientific and crop-producing
    people in the world. Truly a prosperous place to live, but given how few soldiers
    they have, should they really be starting new wars right now?'
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene54.jpg
  narration: Illustrating that point, the battered Gustavus is only half a million
    men and women at arms behind Kruger right now.  But battered he is, and while
    the Swedes have had some great underdog moments in the past, it will be hard to
    pull this one out, especially when Skynet and Mini-Pedro are working together
    again.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene55.jpg
  narration: There’s not a Swedish unit in sight in the Balkans or Ukraine. Antioch
    has joined the green, as has Adrianople, ending Gustavus’s last outposts on the
    Black Sea.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene56.jpg
  narration: Pedro’s core, as fully carpeted as ever. Some of those planes may be
    better placed in his overseas colonies, but given how well he’s doing, who am
    I to question his strategies?
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene57.jpg
  narration: Buccaneer Africa is well carpeted and protected by a dense array of nukes.
    The pirates are doing their best to prepare for the day the inevitable lime-green
    reckoning comes.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene58.jpg
  narration: "“BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER.
    THIS IS NOT A DRILL” and indeed it isn’t. Korea is in fact the source of the missile
    threat with Sibir helping them out. Can Hawaii’s valiant navy defeat the might
    of Big Carrier, or will this little patch of orange be contained?"
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: Image 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene59.jpg
  narration: 'Kamehameha shows is his secret weapon: Triplanes! In fairness he’s got
    a jet there to. Why he moved them onto a vulnerable carrier instead of keeping
    them on his home island is beyond me.'
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: Image 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene60.jpg
  narration: "“We may be last in tech, but we are 1st in heart.”"
- scene_number: "61"
  scene_title: Image 61
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene61.jpg
  narration: This war is sponsored by Big Carrier, keeping Korea 12th in active duty
    military. Their technology may be second to none, but lobbying has crippled the
    government of Sejong the Pious (the first leader we’ve seen who isn’t “The Terrible”).
- scene_number: "62"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part104-scene62.jpg
  narration: Kuchum Khan is in the middle of the pack on everything. He’s pretty far
    from Hawaii’s tiny island, so I doubt he’ll matter in this war.

  narration: The Kimberley mechs land and F keys are primed as Batticaloa’s Finnish
    and Afghan defenders struggle against the Giant Death Robots and their marine
    escort. Meanwhile a Vietnamese worker and carrier are on a lonely mission to continue
    the OCP-II’s work. And here we conclude our journey. Will Finland survive? Will
    Hawaii be extinguished? Can Brazil be stopped? Find out next time on CBR.
