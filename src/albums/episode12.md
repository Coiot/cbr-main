  narration: "<p>Welcome to Part 12 of the Civilization V Battle Royale, otherwise known as CBRX (or “sea bricks”). I’m /u/AutisticNotWeird, one of the mods on /r/civbattleroyale and occasional OC writer (largely stories, as well as the power rankings charts). Having followed the battle royales for over four years now, it’s awesome to have a chance to narrate a part- and I hope the events of Part 12 will be as enjoyable for you as they have been for me. </p>"

  scene_title: "Can’t... stop… looking..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>For the intro OC slide, I have chosen /u/ARedundantSofa’s Uruguay civball. Because I just can’t stop staring at it. Those eyes have not just pierced my soul, but gained control of it… and every part of me has surrendered to its glare… it’s drawing me in to its sweet white maw… and I know all will be peaceful in its radiant sunshine…</p><p>Please. Someone help.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>However the hell /u/Vihreaa gets these out so quickly, it’s really appreciated by all of us. I could look at maps like this all day and still spot new things. The main differences between this and the post-Part-10 map are largely border expansions and a couple of settlements. Some main city switches include Korean Daegu going to the Khamugs, Seljuk Rey going to Palmyra, and the Vikings burning St Andrews to the ground.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>The second starting map is /u/ThyReformer’s “Subjectively Pretty chart of Objectively Relevant™ wars”, or SPOR map for short. As well as looking aesthetically pleasing, it’s a very useful guide to which wars are likely to have an impact during this part.</p>"
- scene_number: 05
  scene_title: "And guess who’s #1?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uruguay beats the tournament record for most weeks at #1, topping the charts for the fourth week in a row- an almost unanimous decision from the power rankers. Partly because of the expansionist nature of the civ, partly the passivity (or incompetence) of their neighbours, and partly the fact that they rank so highly in the little things like military, food, techs and production.</p>"

  scene_title: "Underdogs"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Quite generously, Blue Cassette has asked me to talk about Underdogs for a bit! (I was pleasantly surprised to be honest, but I’m assured I’m not the first person to be asked to discuss their projects as a thank you for their role in the sub.)</p><p>Underdogs, for those who haven’t heard of it, is a dystopia series with autistic/dyslexic/neurodiverse heroes- teenagers who escaped an attack on their special school. They are fighting to free the rest of the imprisoned population, learning how to use their strengths in a world that has only ever seen their weaknesses. As of last week the sequel got fully funded, so it’s officially becoming a series!</p><p>For those curious to know more, just google “Underdogs Chris Bonnello” or go to chrisbonnello.com/underdogs. For those who want Part 12 to just bloody start already, scroll for one more slide (although to be fair, most of those people aren’t even reading this sentence).</p><p>Let’s begin!</p>"

  scene_title: "Ah, linear empires."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>We begin with the Goths and their assault on multiple Muscovy cities. Muscovy’s empire has the same vulnerability as the Huns did in MkII- their empire is almost entirely linear. Pro-tip for any would-be emperors: in order for your empire to have a strong core, it needs to have a core. As in, not having every single city on the front line of any war with a neighbour.</p><p>(Side note- just look at that perfect diagonal line of Goth composite bowmen. Isn’t it beautiful?)</p>"
- scene_number: 08
  scene_title: "How does a Moorish settler propose to his girlfriend?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Al-Mariyyah. How romantic.</p><p>I’m not quite sure how that Viking worker has ended up within Moorish borders. Perhaps it’s heading towards the recently-founded city of Vasterås, which made the Vikings the third civ to settle Greenland. It’s only a matter of time before either they, the Manx or the Métis take the whole island for themselves, and presumably sell it to some future oddball world leader.</p>"
- scene_number: 09
  scene_title: "Alice about to spring again..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>With Alice Springs being one of the cities to do the flip flop last part, Papua looks almost mathematically certain to get it back. And once they do, they will have to defend it against an Australia with no melee land units visible on their continent (in this screenshot anyway), and a distant, marginally inferior navy.</p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "The sub pops out a spy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yep, we now have a spy! Don’t get too excited though, because s/he doesn’t get used this part.</p><p>The main feature here is the Haida attack on Qing’s city of Fuzhou. They have quite a sizeable fleet but their efforts may be hampered by the Yup’ik fleet in their way, which they’re no longer allowed to kill thanks to an inconvenient peace treaty.</p><p>Meanwhile, a trireme in a lake next to Busan shouts “I’m helping!”</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Malaqah? I hardly know ‘er."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rather concerningly, the Manx have started to look fairly thin on their own islands. The Moors, meanwhile, have brought up a huge force to defend their city on the tip of northern France- rendering it completely safe except for that one weak spot. If that Manx trireme takes the city, the Moors will have no excuses for not immediately taking it back.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Ok, smartypants."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Shikoku capital Kochi wins a previously-unknown contest to become THE WORLD’S GREATEST CITY.</p><p>For those wondering, this contest comes from a mod called “Greatest cities”. The rule means that “At the dawn of each new era, the highest ranked world city [based on a range of complex criteria] becomes a World's Greatest City, which allows that city to build a Triumphal Arch.” The arch gives the civ +5 happiness.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "“What about us?”"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Clearly, Hawkes didn’t communicate with his forces much before declaring peace with Maratha. Three of his ships- most notably a carrack (for those who didn’t know either, a carrack is a naval unit that comes with the Enlightenment era mod)- are trapped in the sea, unable to get home through Marathan waters. I just wish that carrack had been trapped between Java and Sumatra like those New Zealander triemes. Then I could have cracked a joke about Carrack-atoa being dormant for hundreds of years to come.</p><p>Meanwhile, Madagascar sends some of its people to Indonesia. Which seems like IRL history in reverse (Madagascar being settled by south-east Asian explorers in the real world).</p>"

  scene_title: "We are lumberjacks and we’re ok, we sleep all night and we work all day..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Canadian forests are loaded with the Iroquois Lumberjack squad, chopping their way to Ottawa. (Ok, fine, they’re tomahawk raiders- a swordsman replacement that doesn’t require iron and ignores zones of control. But they also have the woodsman promotion and they’re in Canada, so I consider them lumberjacks.) The parallel assault on Quebec City is going badly, with the two triremes from the last part gone and the Iroquois lacking in nearby melee units.</p><p>Also in this scene, you get to see the first in what becomes a large theme for this part- massively overconfident settlers. The Iroquois are so confident in taking Quebec City that they’re already looking to settle near it… but that pales in comparison to the Apache’s THREE settlers in the Canadian heartland.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "All calm in the Caribbean"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>For all the threats of Barcelona falling to Haiti and all the rest of it, this part of the world is fairly calm. Poverty Point have statoned a catapult in the Bahamas though, just in case.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Fun fact: in this universe, the word “minnow” is derived from “Minoa”."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>It was only a matter of time until the tide turned against Minoa… and it’s happened catastrophically. Derna fell to a desperately overwhelming Nubian force, and both Nubia and the Ottomans go straight for the capital. Somewhere under Knossos, Minos starts building a complex maze to hide himself in.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Sometimes, war means surrounding the enemy with reindeer."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Evenk city of Erema - forward-settling both the Nenets and the Kazakhs - falls to the latter. And with two more settlers out in the east, it seems that the Evenks are copying the old Kazakh strategy of settling a new city for each one they lose.</p><p>And it is lost, because those reindeer archers are chariot archer replacement who cannot take the city back.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "The Manx reach mainland Europe"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>That little gap was all that trireme needed. The Moors shouldn’t have any problem taking it back. In fact, they’re so sure of themselves that they’ve sent out an overconfident settler right into the Manx homeland. (I don’t think of it so much a Moor settler, but more like a Manx worker in training.)</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Dey of the Dead"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Don’t worry, I’m not going to come up with a Dey pun for every Algeria slide. /u/ThelpleJonesion’s efforts last part were admirable enough. The Dey is a great general replacement who build Ksars- more powerful versions of citadels. If they’re actually used, that is.</p><p>Despite the flipping of Oran last part and the fact it’ll probably flip at least once again, Algeria might end up ok here. But they really shouldn’t have to fight so hard to be as “ok” as this. All the great generals in the world are no substitute for competent strategy. And Algeria should know, since they must have most of the world’s generals.</p>"

  scene_title: "Worker of the Week"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Three of Venezuela’s cities get production bonuses at the same time!</p><p>If anyone’s wondering why, it’s because they’re chopping down their jungles. Pity, they could have used them for science bonuses someday.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Alice may or may not have sprung"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>I have no idea whether this city flipped or was never taken by Papua in the first place. I suspect it flipped, as it would explain the deaths of so many units since last time we looked.</p><p>Most likely, the Papuans conquered the city and immediately sailed back for Perth, heading home to party in the knowledge that their job was done forever and the city could not possibly fall again.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "End of days"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Looks like it’s over for Minoa. The only question is who will go down in history as their eventual killer. Nubia’s previous performance against Minoa is impressive enough, although the Ottomans will be looking to balance out their lack of anything noteworthy throughout this whole contest.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nenets become several leaders’ enemy right out of nowhere.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "...we cut down trees, we eat our lunch, we go to the lavatoryyyy..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The lumberjack forces around Ottawa are wearing thin, so they solve the issue by embarking. (Maybe that’s the answer to the age-old question “where do lumberjacks go to get away from it all?” Perhaps they go to the lakes where no trees exist.)</p><p>Quebec City looks like a lost cause, but the Iroquois have at least taken London once again. On the overconfident settler front, the Apache settle a city in the almost tile-perfect centre of the Canadian empire, and an Iroquois settler attacks Calgary single-handedly. And who would win? A 7-pop Canadian city, or 1 Iroquois settler? If it weren’t for how the Iroquois are struggling with their actual army, that would be a tricky question.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "How the not-very-mighty have fallen"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Seljuk empire is now looking utterly pitiful (and linear). At war with both of their neighbours and with a very small army, their best defence is the terrain they were spawned in. Rey is lost, out of range of any Seljuk melee units.</p><p>Up north, the Golden Horde do about as much as they normally do. And on the sidebar, the Holy Roman Empire joins in the mass war against the Nenets.</p><p>Incidentally, did anyone else used to get bullied by the occasional kid who didn’t actually hate you, but just bullied you to make themselves more popular with the cool kids who were also bullying you? Because that’s you, Holy Roman Empire, whoever’s leading you this week. You and all the other wimpy civs who just are picking on the weakling to get more popularity points for yourself. You’re those school bullies in AI form. Bastards.</p>"

  scene_title: "Boat-con!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ok, I’m feeling better now.</p><p>Macao is safe thanks to the peace treaty with Shikoku (however long that lasts), leaving the Shikoku navy to sail through the beautifully diagonal Boat-con. Meanwhile, a Madagascan composite bowman lies trapped between Canton and Qin, and a Sulu great prophet sets off to spread Bogomilism into mainland Asia.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "The Manx Sea"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Manx settle another city on Greenland. Although the city’s not great, it’ll be a decisive obstacle for anyone wanting to sail between Europe and North America until they learn how to enter the ocean.</p><p>Meanwhile, Scotland seem to be doing what I do whenever I’m attacked from the sea- not building a navy to fight them, but just carpeting my land with ranged units. (I’m not saying it’s a good strategy; it’s just what I end up doing.) Of course, when facing a Viking UU which can spawn land units right next to your cities, a bowmen carpet may be a good idea.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>If Madagascar put as much effort into Africa as they’re doing in Asia, Zimbabwe would be desperately throwing cities at them in surrender.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Seljuk island city of Kermanshah is looking healthy. It’ll make a fine capital for the civ in a few parts’ time.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Al-Bury-ya"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Manx navy have put up a decent fight, but that catapult and new naval unit (plus the city’s ranged attack) is almost certainly enough for the Moors to stay on Iceland.</p><p>Muscovy, Qin and India jump on the Nenets Hate Train, leading thousands of soldiers to ask “wait, what’s a train?” Libya, meanwhile, get their geography slightly wrong and declare war on the Kazakhs instead.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Burning desert"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>East Africa- the southern tip of Beta Israel- is now a pillaged wasteland. However, all that pillaging has not led to any meaningful progress for Zimbabwe against Balankab (not yet, anyway). But just look at that attack carpet! Even deity AI can’t lose in this position, right?</p>"

  scene_title: "And now, catch your breath."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>We now look at northwest North America, one of the quietest regions on the cylinder. Everywhere here is calm except for the sea, which is packed with potential reinforcements for the Haida’s cross-continental wars.</p><p>This shot also offers a revealing look into the Métis fringes: the Métis empire may look vast and widespread on any map, but this is what many of their cities look like.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Your ranged unit bias is showing..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Taungoo have slipped into inactivity, following an excellent start to the tournament. But it has to be said, they don’t look dreadfully unhealthy for it. A nice part of the world is theirs, it’ll be difficult for any potential invaders, and they have a nice healthy carpet. They even have a pet Seljuk scout in its own little pen.</p>"

  scene_title: "Scene 26- the twenty-sixth shot."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>A rare shot of Central Asia that reminds us why these shots are so rare. I’m sure in a few parts time some war will start here and it’ll be explosive, but right now the most interesting thing here is a Qing great prophet attempting to walk on water.</p>"

  scene_title: "What?! Alice Sprang?!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>A lone Motu warrior heads up to Alice Springs to see how their new subjects are doing, and is shocked to find that the city was retaken by Australia several turns ago! Perhaps he should run back to Perth and break the news to those who are still celebrating their victory, if he survives the run home.</p>"

  death: 'yes'
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>And that’s it- Minoa are eliminated in 60th place. (They do have a few melee units in various far-flung places, but let’s not pretend they could take a city.) The Ottomans storm the island of Crete, and Minos heads into his elaborate hiding maze, never to resurface.</p><p>A few weeks ago, I asked the subreddit whether those who had voted Minoa into the tournament had ended up regretting it. (I had no idea at the time that it would be me writing their obituary.) The general feedback was that nobody had any regrets- Minoa were likely to be an interesting civ, who would either do well and impress us all, or do terribly and leave more space in Europe for other civs to have a better chance.</p><p>And you know what? I think they’ve done both. Minoa may have been short-lived, but they were memorable. They made brave attempts to get off their own island and, despite giving away Malia in a peace deal, showed the occasional moment of badassery. Their capture of Derna may have brought them down, but it was a better way to go than just turtling on a two-tile island.</p>"

  scene_title: "Battle carpets"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the Marathan carpet navy attacking the Omani carpet army. If Maratha really, really commit to it they could flip Muscat again, especially since Oman don’t appear to have unlocked the secret to composite bows. Oman has too many melee units for Maratha to realistically keep the capital though.</p>"

Meanwhile Yaroslavl, Muscovy’s only city away from their linear empire, looks about to fall (if those Goth horsemen can survive the run into the city). “Hey,” yells Alaric with a laugh, pointing to the city of Yaroslavl, “that’s out of line!”</p>"

  narration: "<p>All looks calm in this region of the Far East. So calm, that the Khamugs only have a warrior defending the former Korean city of Daegu. It’s still in rebellion, which means if the Qing were to declare war now, that warrior would literally be the city’s only defence. (I doubt it would happen though- the counter-attack from the Khamug core may be easy to repel, but the Qing are unlikely to risk it regardless.)</p>"

  narration: "<p>This shot may only be a matter of pixels away from the last one, but a fair bit’s happened since then- most notably in the notifications column.</p><p>New Zealand peaces out with the Murri and immediately declares war on Australia. I know it’s over 800 years before 1984, but I get the feeling that citizens are being told “New Zealand is at war with Australia. New Zealand has always been at war with Australia. The Murri are our friends. The Murri have always been our friends.”</p><p>The Sulu are also part of the double-DoW, and if they can get their Proa navy past the trapped Tonga triremes, they may end up being dangerous.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here it is- the ultimate overconfident settler. Or, more likely, some poor guy who didn’t get the memo that war against Australia was imminent.</p><p>This poor settler’s literal best chance of survival is to morph into a city and try to kill units with ranged attacks. Not that it would work.</p>"

The citizens of London have changed leaders so many times recently that even they probably don’t remember who’s at war with them.</p><p>Quebec City is now an unmissable target, with a Iroquois trireme and a clan of lumberjacks close by. But let’s see what the AI says. After all, Ottawa- against the odds- is utterly unharmed.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode12-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Just for fun, not long ago I did some research on the Selk’nam, just to get a bit of background. It turns out they were a very small community to begin with, numbering only 4000 in the mid-19th century. They were shrunk devastatingly by European settlers in southern Argentina, falling to just 25 in 1945 (the last full-blood Selk’nam dying in 1974, although around 500 descendents are around today). So there are probably more Selk’nam people in this picture than there ever were in the historical community.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It may not have been mentioned in the visible notifications, but Canton and Shikoku are at it again. Macao is safe in the immediate term but they’ll be needing reinforcements before too long- especially with the Shikoku jizamurai coming (their UU pikeman replacement).

The Holy Roman Empire has a guaranteed peacetime channel between the Baltic and the North Sea, or at least denies it to the Vikings. It’s an extremely handy place for a citadel, as if the Vikings haven’t suffered enough at the hands of the Prussian generals. The HRE only needs one more general and they could take the whole of Zealand (the Danish island where Copenhagen is) if they place a citadel on the south-west tile.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minoan units mope around in Sami waters, praying that Minos is safe somewhere down in that labyrinth. Those Galéas can enter other civs’ waters, so they don’t have to rely on open borders to avoid being plunged into the ocean and vanished from the game.

Because the IRL Yucatan peninsula was apparently named after a Spanish explorer who asked the local Mayans what their land was called, and got a response sounding like “yucatan”. So, for centuries to come, our maps and globes labelled the land with the Mayan phrase for “I don’t understand you”.</p><p>In my own personal headcanon, the Kuikoru landed on this Carbbean island (or a “gahïtï”, as the locals call them), and asked the native islanders what their word for island was.</p>"

For example, the Timurids in MkII were shockingly bad, but the real Timurids were an enormously successful empire. The Seljuks were also huge, but I probably won’t be able to think of them that way after seeing what their empire has looked like on these maps.</p><p>Comparing this shot to scene 18, the Golden Horde have moved a worker, two settlers, and one composite bowman.
