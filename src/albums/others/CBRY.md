    narration: "<p>EW (ExplosiveWatermelon): Hello friends!</p><p></p><p>Coiot: Hello and happy holidays everyone! We welcome you to a short experiment that has consumed the last seven days for me to get ready from inception to completion in time for a Christmas release: CBRY Season 1 Episode 1. </p><p></p><p>Credits for this album go to JFD, Tophat, and EW for providing some debugging and code cleanup, Limaeus for all the work spent in our new S2 utilities and optimizations, and Lunar for providing city state code he made all the way back in 2017 intended for the original Mk2 rebuild and Mk3.</p><p></p><p>This game was run without DLL on a new M1 Macbook Pro. For anyone wondering, it runs AI games exceptionally well. In fact, not once did the fan even need to be turned on while recording this game, and it’s hardly warm to the touch. Apple sponsorship soon™.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: Now onto the game. CBRY, as previously, is experiential runs using CBRX mods within the smaller confines of the Endgame map to provide more immediate action. So that we can have the focus be on the gmapleplay mods instead of the civs themselves, I’d like to bring back the Mk2 roster since we are all quite familiar with them. </p><p></p><p>As a reminder, the major gameplay mods for CBRX S2 are JFD’s Rise to Power, a variety of small utility mods developed by Limaues and EW, Iska’s Holy Wars and Reformations, and LastSword’s Notification Logger. On top of this, for this setup, we’ll be adding in City States Evolved, which allows for city states to expand and develop their own trade routes. </p><p></p><p>EW: Here we’ve got a bunch of Mark 2 lads and lasses in their True Start Locations, back for another round. Yes, we’ve gotten the gang back together for Christmas! Although, here in Europe it feels like something’s missing. Eh? I’m not supposed to mention Hit-</p><p></p><p>Lore enthusiasts will remember these emerald isles as the birthplace of one of the great nations of Mark 2. Also Ireland and England. Iceland is however relegated to City-State status, whereas England is relegated to No-State status. France and Norway are also just chillin’ in the City-State club, leaving only Ireland as the true Civilization on this slide.</p>"

    narration: "<p>EW: The Ashanti, a vibrant people with little more to do other than enjoy life’s pleasures, have suddenly found themselves in Diplomatic Danganronpa. The Civ Battle Royale will not spare the weak, so let’s hope they can pick up the slack they had in Mark 2.</p><p></p><p>The Zulus, on the other hand, do not slack. They are led by Conquest himself, Shaka Zulu. Will the other horsemen soon join them, however? Ulundi has a lot of space, and the Zulus expansion bias is among the highest in Vanilla Civ 5.</p><p></p><p>Ethiopia and Kongo are City-States now. I don’t have too much to say on them, so I’ll talk about how I like the inclusion of City-States. Civs with City-State uniques can be really fun, and ultimately if someone like Teddy Roosevelt didn’t have City-State uniques, I would love to see them in CBRX. However, the case on my end is that I like being able to see Uniques in action. That’s a modders perspective, so I don’t know if it rings true for everyone- I doubt even other modders would agree.</p>"

I also didn’t notice, but apparently there’s ruins in the maps.</p><p></p><p>While I’m taking this time, I might as well have you take note that we’re running Rise to Power (RtP) for this game. It has some cute flavor elements, as well as some minor and some major gameplay changes. If there’s anything that feels new, it’s most likely an RtP thing.</p>"

But the party pope is top tier.</p><p></p><p>Coiot: And building Dvin. </p><p></p><p>EW: Timur is a cool leader, so I’m happy the Timurids are back as a major. I’m personally a flavor guy when it comes to AI games, what can I say? Mark 2 had some really good parts. I was especially a fan of How to Fight Wars Good. Did you know that it was written by a film director? Sorry, I’ve gone off track. Where was I?</p>"

For now, let’s look at the personality of each City-State here:I personally like Sri Lanka, but they didn’t do much in Mark 2. They’ve got a voice DoM, a cool leader, and survived pretty far.</p><p></p><p>Indonesia had one of the biggest downfalls in CBR history. It was iconic how a civ could REVERSE snowball. What would that be called? Crashing and burning, I guess.</p><p></p><p>The Philippines.</p><p></p><p>Yes, all civs are very unique and lovely.</p>"

Also, they’re technically called Nation-States now, but let’s be real, if I was a competent narrator you guys wouldn’t have read my divorce fanfiction between Seddon and Gambu Ganuurru back in CBRX.</p><p></p><p>Chairman Mao is here as a major. I could easily make some Chinese communist regime jokes, but I’m afraid we’ll lose our potential sponsorship with Apple.</p><p></p><p>Tokugawa’s gone;</p><p>Meiji took the throne again.</p><p>Something seasonal.</p><p></p><p>The heart and Seoul of Korea is back as a City-State.

    narration: "<p>EW: Are those really the Kimberley’s colors? I could’ve sworn they were different. Colonialist Legacies dominates indigenous Australia, which is a bit of a shame because we don’t get much modder diversity in this region. Especially since Australia proper is dominated by Senshidenshi.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Australia Proper; Sydney. Luckily, the Maori are back to nuke them off the face of the planet.

To that, Canada says Sorry!</p><p></p><p>A notable change from Mark 2 is that there’s horses in the Americas now. Perhaps that’ll lead to more conflicts and development in this region?</p>"

They’re back, baby.</p><p></p><p>Texas is also back, and with horses in America this time, they’ll do better. Their leader is Sam Houston, yet they start in Austin. I know that Austin was the capital the majority of the time, but Sam Houston himself wanted to make Houston the capital because it had his name. In any case, I lived in both Houston and Austin, and I can say Houston is better. Austin thrives on their ‘quirky’ persona, a game they’re losing to Denver. Houston, on the other hand, is a pretty honest city. What you see is what you get, depending on where you are. TL;DR I would actually nuke Austin off the face of the Earth because I am a horrible human being.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Cities I don’t like, Washington. I can’t say why I don’t like it without making a political statement though, and I don’t think Coiot wants to do that much subreddit moderating on Christmas.</p><p></p><p>The Maya are here, too. Remember they were in Mark 2? Hopefully they can rise to prominence here.</p>"

    narration: "<p>EW: Honestly, for a region that’s fairly populated with Civilizations, South America sure seems empty. I’m sure it’s for the best- it’ll give Buccs more room to expand. More importantly, there’s a bunch of jungle, so I think it’s great that they kept all the important cities on the coast.</p><p></p><p>The Inca deserve to be a major, tbh. They’re a strong Firaxis civ, but generally underperformed in Mark 2. I think they can pick up the pace here.</p><p></p><p>Chile is back, which I think is another great choice. It was either that or Argentina, and tbh I don’t think Argentina is as good as Chile. As a mod, at least. I’ve never been to any country. What can I say? Well, I can say that Chile will need to pick up a lot of land to break out in South America.</p><p></p><p>Argentina and Brazil are City-States.</p><p></p><p>Coiot: I tried Argentina, but they were boring. Chile has city state bonuses, too. </p>"

Meiji’s already off to a rough start, having no real good expansion opportunities, but they’ll get some good bonuses from Mt. Fuji, at least.</p><p></p><p>Mao sends his senior advisor to greet the Japanese. Unfortunately, despite my distant relatives’ assumptions, Chinese and Japanese are different languages. It’s a rough start to developing peaceful negotiations, so perhaps a non-peaceful alternative will work?</p>"

What’s worse for their competitors is they took a pretty good region with a few resources and a lot of food.

Instead of settling south or west, Texas has claimed a big portion of the US core. The Blackfeet, on the other hand, choose a pretty poor spot where they are open to a future forward settled by the Lone Star state.

    narration: "<p>Coiot: Going to include the Diplomacy screens to see if I missed screenshotting any wonders, social policy progression, and see who is allied with whom. Chile in particular seem to have recently renewed their friendship with the Blackfoot. They have the Statue of Zues so hopefully they put it to good use again soon.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: Canada is at war with Texas but has at least secured their backside from attack by allying with Iceland. Not that Iceland is an immediate threat or expansion option at the moment.</p><p></p><p>EW: They would be a threat if they were an actual civ >:(</p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: Ireland seems to have been focusing on the diplomatic side of the competition and has secured a number of friends. The Isles are quite a stronghold for now, so making friends with the continent is a good strategy.   </p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: Timur has Petra and Desert Folklore. Get ready for the r/civ circlejerk posts! Or is that too much 2017 nostalgia for the day? </p><p></p><p>EW: /r/civ should honestly ban those posts. I get it, you did the funny meme thing. How about some original content, for once?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: The Ashanti seem to be rather behind on social policy gains. Three points into Honor but most others have at least completed an entire branch by now. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: Maria seems to have still been friends with Ireland, but not enough of a friendship to do battle against Poland. She has eyes on the Mediterreanen it seems and is not interested in the colder climates occupied by Poland or Ireland. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbry-season1-episode1-scene107.jpg
    narration: "<p>Coiot: In the Demographics screen we find that the Inca lead in several categories. No doubt unquestioned expansion and a quick one-two against the Buccs put them in a very favorable position. We’ll see how they fare against Chile later in the game. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: In the Religion Overview map we see the spread of religions is still quite clustered around the middle of Eurasia. But there are still a few slots left so hopefully more of the map gets colored in. </p>"

    scene_title: "It’s Christmas! Get it?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbry-season1-episode1-scene109.jpg
    narration: "<p>EW: I like these religions. The most interesting I think is Wakan Tanka and Nestorianism, but I’m pretty sure the latter is just a fallback because the Mughals had their base religion taken. Personally, I wish religion was more influential in these games, but it’s still good to see the map painted with them.</p><p>Coiot: CBRX with the new religion mods should spice things up. CBRY has Holy Wars, but could not make use of the DLL dependent mods that made things more diverse. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Coiot: The Beliefs screen shows some of the bonuses so far. Nothing too impressive, though the Blackfoot seems to have a nice mix. </p>"

    scene_title: "Don’t stop-"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbry-season1-episode1-scene112.jpg
    narration: "<p>EW: Frankly, there’s little here I would consider game changing. Catholicism has Fertility Rites, which can be pretty good. Lutheranism grants a bonus to the Nation-States, which is fun. However, the case is that religion needs some larger dynamic to really be influential in an AI game, as much as I hate to say it. Still, religious civs can be some of my favorites- Priamurye, one of my designs, is one of my favorites that I’ve done. Anyways, this is the last slide, so I suspect I’ll have to say some final words before Coiot puts me back in his dungeon.</p><p></p><p>Alas! It has been a very merry Christmas, indeed! Though I am left with no conclusion, I am still satisfied. Coiot has put together a wonderful little game, and I hope you enjoyed this. </p><p></p><p>Coiot: That is all for this time. I’ll also be providing the notification exports in a separate post. If you liked the start of the game let us know in the post thread. We can either continue this game or start anew with a different roster. If we continue, I expect us to do a little more worldbuilding and develop some community roleplay as we show something like 15-20 turns at a time every week. So please do provide feedback, and have a safe holiday season! </p>"
