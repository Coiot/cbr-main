    narration: "<p>Zdravo svima i dobrodošli (Hello everyone and welcome) to the Civ Battle Royale X or CBRX Season 3 Episode 7. My name is BV (or anarcho-balkan on Reddit) and I will be your narrator for today. You might know me as the narrator of Season 2 Episode 18, in which case, I apologize for spoiling the results of the Para-Mara War half-way through. Although I can’t guarantee that I won’t stop making spoilers at all, I can promise that any spoilers I may or may not give in the narration won’t be anywhere near the blatantness or importance of that. Other than that, you might also recognize me as the maker of the Ainu and Yugoslavia civballs, or as that weird Montenegrin guy on Discord. This episode is due to be released on the 16th of November 2022, just one day before my 21st birthday, so I think that makes it obvious why, despite my busy schedule, I decided to narrate this episode specifically. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Another excellent map by Virrhea, our resident cartographer for the past how many seasons. We can also see their continued insistence that Castile isn’t real, a thing that I’ve chosen to interpret as a meme, because it’s funnier that way. </p>"

    narration: "<p>A big thank you to our Ko-Fi donators who made past seasons, make this season and will surely make future seasons possible with their donations. I’m sadly unable to donate myself, but if you can chip in some of your spare e-monis (I think as little as a dollar) it would be a big help. I heard donators get some cool perks too. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season3-pr6-scene61.jpg
    narration: "<p>With the minimal amount of surprise physically possible without it being no surprise at all, the Permyans have maintained the top spot in the power rankings. They have 10 cities, a large army, still plenty of space to expand to by both settling and military means. But they also had a sub-par showing in their invasion of Khazaria thus far, and their economy is kinda shit rn. Will the Permyans be able to maintain their lead? We shall see. </p>"

    scene_title: "Mandate of Heaven"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>On with the show. </p><p></p><p>On this slide, we see Ming deciding that a war with the Han is a good idea, actually. On one hand, I’m not too sure, given that Han is obviously the bigger and more powerful of the two Chinese imperial dynasties, but on the other hand, the Han army isn’t really well placed for defending the cities that would likely be on Ming’s path or for attacking Ming’s cities. The Han city of Xindu and the faraway Ming colony of Guangzhou both have minimal defenders, while the Ming army seems well positioned to beat the Han defenders of Longbian. The main Han army is somewhat far away from the frontlines, concentrated around the capital of Chang’an and the northern city of Fanyang. If Ming plays their cards right, they might get a city out of this. I guess we’ll wait and see. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Irish capture Rotterdam from the Anglo-Dutch, whom the Irish claim oppressed their ancestors in an alternate timeline. Wanting revenge for that, the Irish decide to burn Rotterdam to the ground, as a message that no Williamite Englishman is gonna step foot on what are now their islands. </p>"

    scene_title: "A setting Sun"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, we see that Egypt is essentially under siege. Turkish forces are barrelling down on Assur, Norman forces have started dealing damage to Thebes, and a combined Chadian-Yemeni assault is closing in on the capital Akhetaten itself. Akhenaten continues insisting that Aten is the only true deity of the land and that he will soon save Egypt from the invaders, but this increasingly starts looking like him descending into madness (if he hasn’t already) to his advisors. Egypt may not survive, and even if it does, its days as an imperial power are as good as over. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in Australia, we see that the Wiradjuri invasion of Yolngu has failed. Not only have they not penetrated the border but the war has moved into their territory, if only slightly. The Yolngu actually maintain at least local numerical superiority over the Wiradjuri, tho, of course, since we cannot see all of the Wiradjuri empire, we do not know if this translates into an overall numerical superiority or not. More concerningly for the Wiradjuri, a small Yolngu fleet has attacked the undefended colony of Wagga Wagga in Papua. Two of the three attacking ships are near dead, so Yolngu definitely isn’t gonna capture the city, but the fact that Wiradjuri allowed this to transpire in the first place should in on itself be concerning for them and their fans. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Anglo-Dutch and Ireland made peace. </p>"

    scene_title: "Religion map"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>Oh, oof. I probably should’ve made a list of religions on Word like I did last season. Uh… The largest religions right now appear to be Turkey’s Sunni, Arapaho’s Nestorianism, Anglo-Dutch’s Lutheranism and Vladimir’s Eastern Orthodoxy, with the mid-tier made up of Central America’s Catholicism, Timor-Leste’s Arianism, Kilwa’s Bogomilism and Gokturks’ Tengriism. Ireland’s Oriental Orthodoxy, Qocho’s Therevada, Kayapo’s Catharism and Comanche’s Peyotism seem to be struggling. </p>"

    scene_title: "Besieged river valley"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>The siege of Egypt continues, but it almost looks like Akhenaten’s praying and preaching has borne fruit somewhat. </p><p></p><p>The Normans seem to have abandoned the siege of Thebes, and a look at the thingy in the upper-left corner of the screen shows they are no longer on the list of civs Egypt is at war with. Indeed, the next slide will show that the Normans and Egypt have made peace. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, despite Akhetaten being almost completely surrounded by Yemeni and Chadian troops, the city actually seems to have fully healed. “Maybe Akhenaten isn’t that mad after all” an Egyptian advisor dares to hope. However, it might well be that the Chadians are merely reorganizing for the next assault, as evidenced by the presence of one Gwaggaeto the Great near Sarh. If CBRX Gwaggaeto is anything like OTL Gwaggaeto, this is a good sign for Chad.</p><p></p><p>IRL, Gwaggaeto was a king of the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo for 22 years in the late 4th and early 5th centuries. He consolidated Goguryeo rule in what is now Manchuria, defeated the rival Korean kingdom of Baekje and captured its capital, which was located where Seoul is today, and defended the allied Korean kingdom of Silla from a combined invasion by Baekje, the Gaya Confederacy and the Japanese, before vassalizing it. He defeated the Xianbei-decended Later Yan dynasty in northeastern China, taking Liaodong from them, defended against yet another Japanese invasion, and then conquered more territories in Manchuria, Primorye and even against the Rouran in Inner Mongolia. He also campaigned against the proto-Mongolic Khitan people, claiming to have destroyed 3 of their tribes in a battle. He even declared himself emperor. </p><p></p><p>Now you can claim to have learned some actual history from this season, and DocIto can now mark the audio-narration video as educational. You’re welcome. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Speaking of Korea, North Korea and the Han had just made peace after a largely uneventful war. It seems like a North Korean army has made its way all the way to Jiangling’s city borders, and a Han qiang spearman has sustained considerable damage, but that seems to be the extent of that tussle. Oh well, I didn’t expect much of this war anyway. </p><p></p><p>To the south, we can see the Ming entering Han territory southeast of Jinyang, and have started dealing some damage to the Han armies. Despite this, the low number of forces each side had in the immediate area tells me this ain’t gonna go anywhere. </p>"

    scene_title: "In the hills"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over here we see the void Castile. I think Isabella really dropped the ball when peacing out with William (who has just peaced out with Robert “the Old Fox” Guiscard). Now, she’s largely boxed in, more by Tétouan than the Anglo-Dutch. She still has a respectable army and reasonably strong cities, but she would be better off using them on neighbours. </p>"
  - scene_number: 14
    scene_title: "IMPOSSIBLE!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>For those who’ve been looking at the minimap since slide 9 - no, your eyes weren’t deceiving you. For everyone else - no your eyes aren’t deceiving you rn. This is real. Somehow. After who knows how long, the Comanche have finally settled their 2nd city, Penateka. This is a momentous occasion. We must do something to commemorate this. </p><p></p><p>This whole thing aside tho, it seems like the Mohave invasion of Comanche isn’t going so well. The border is filled with mountains, forcing the Mohave to funnel through multiple chokepoints, favouring the Comanche defenders. Even in places where the Mohave crossed these chokepoints, the number and type of unit simply isn’t adequate to turn the tide in their favour. Two scouts, one of whom is in yellow health, aren’t enough to outflank a wall of spearmen and archers, Irataba. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in western Siberia, we see the Permyans and Tuva, settling towards each other. Notably, Tuva is heading beyond the tundra into the Arctic wastes, settling Kyzyl-Mazhalyk last episode and Bay-Khaak this episode there, while the Permyan city of Izyur is settled between the Vasyugan and Irtysh rivers. </p>"

    scene_title: "Upper Plate War"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over on this slide, the main focus seems to be on the Upper Plate War between the Inca and Brazil. This seems to mostly amount to skirmishes on the upper Parana, near the borders of São Salvador. We can also see Rio dela Plata just kinda… being there in the south. The Inca, Brazil and the Kayapó all have settlers heading out, with the Brazilian one seemingly poised to settle a city first. </p>"

    scene_title: "War of Two Dynasties"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in China, we see that the Ming have advanced forward and are starting to deal damage to Longbian. However, it seems like Yongle is committing the classic AI mistake of splitting his army’s attention between multiple frontlines, as part of the army seems to be heading to Jinyang, where they’re making much less headway. If I was Ming, I would put a mere holding force near Jinyang to stop any Han reinforcements or counterattacks and focus my full attention on capturing Longbian. But, AI’s gonna AI, so Ming probably won’t heed my suggestion. Neither would Han heed my suggestion of moving their core troops to the frontlines, because, again, AI logic, I guess. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Maori have made their first tentative steps outside Aoteroa by settling Pirongia in New Caledonia. Their garrison of a composite archer and a nearby scout are immediately greeted by strange travelers from afar, for a damaged Bengali trireme has docked off New Caledonia’s main island. </p><p></p><p>To the side, we see that the Wiradjuri don’t have much of an army near Moothi and Wahluu, which, combined with what we’ve seen earlier, lends credence to my hypothesis that the Yolngu, at worst, have numerical parity with them. </p>"

    scene_title: "A big, sandy, gap"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>Mali has decided to declare war on the Normans. I don’t think the distance really allows this war to go much of anywhere. Mali only has 2 scouts near Capua, which, despite the city’s only defence being a trireme, I doubt is enough to capture the city. If Mali could send reinforcements from Fez or across the Sahara, we might see Capua be under bigger pressure, but that doesn’t seem to be happening rn. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, and only personally important to me, I’m noticing a certain city on Sardinia. However, I think I’m gonna save my needless hyperfocus on it for a later slide, where it’s closer to the middle of the screen. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Qocho has enhanced Theravada, which gives us an excuse to look at the Tarim Basin and the Taklamakan desert (the title of this slide is a translation of that desert’s Turkic name, btw). Qocho is still defending against a Tuvan assault, Guangzhou is defending pretty well from what seem to be half-hearted Han advances, and the Mohave, rather than continuing their pilgrimage to the Caspian (as I’ve been told happened in multiple testruns), settled Avi Mota on the Tarim river.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Yolngu and Wiradjuri have made peace. The war is best described as a draw. And since Yolgnu, IIRC, have been ranked much lower than Wiradjuri, a draw is just as good as a victory for them. </p>"

Yemen is sending some units to support the siege effort. Egypt’s empire is collapsing around them. Turkey has also settled Konya in central Iran, all but cutting-off the Yemeni colony of Asir. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we see the list of largest armies. Bengal and the Gokturks are in the lead, with over 110k each. The rest of the 100k+ group is made up of the Cree, Tuva and the Arapaho. Following them, at 90k+ each, are Lithuania, Chile, Afghanistan and the Inca. Trailing behind them is a pack of 80k+ armies, of which the only visible ones on this slide are the Zulu, Kokang, Han and America. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Brandenburg further solidifies its hold on Scandinavia, settling Allenstein, in between the somewhat earlier settles of Kleve and Falkensee. Although by now the major contender for this part of Europe, they aren’t the only ones tho, as Lithuania has been spreading its tendrils into Finland, the most recent settle (albeit one made last episode) being the city of Palanga, on the White Sea coast. Who will get to the roof of Europe first. </p>"

    scene_title: "Juche-Mori War 2, Spearman boogaloo"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>We now see why Kim Il-Sung gave up on his Chinese ambitions. He wanted to get rid of the thorn in his side that is Tajihi-Sarugake. “For too long have the imperialist Mori existed as a blight on the glorious land of Chŏson! The people shall now emancipate themselves from the Japanese! Long live Juche, long live Chŏson!” he stated during his DOW speech at the Pyongyang politburo. Indeed, 2 North Korean spearmen have already went on the offensive on the northern borders of the Mori city… and have already suffered damage against the local garrison’s archer. </p><p></p><p>Honestly, the Mori hardly could’ve settled their Korean colony better if they tried. On the coast, on a hill, behind another hill, flanked by two mountains. The natural defenses alone are imposing, and have already beaten back a North Korean invasion once. Although the North Korean army is bigger now, the Mori garrison of Tajihi-Sarugake has also increased. The city’s own anti-siege weaponry is further augmented by a garrisoned acher. A spearman is blocking the only land passage into the city, while another one is placed on a hill to the south of the southern mountain, ready to fight off or flank any North Korean troops coming up from Chongjin, and 3 triremes provide naval support. The city will be a tough nut to crack, and even if it does fall, the small but nevertheless numerically superior Mori navy has more avenues of attack and reinforcement than the North Korean army has, making flipping very possible. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Over on this slide, we see the newly settled Cree city of Loon River, on the wrong side of the Rockies, as well as the continuing Kwak-Modoc war. Modoc has reached all the way to the Kwak border, fighting along the Columbia river valley, but they very probably aren’t gonna be going much further than that. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode7-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in the Eastern Med, we see that the siege of Akhetaten seems to have been at least partially lifted. An ostensibly alive Botswanan scout has arrived inside the borders of Thebes, and there’s generally little interesting stuff going on here. Keen-eyed observers would’ve seen a Kyivan settler in the north Aegean and a Yugoslav settler in central Greece several slides ago. Well both moved further south since, with the Kyivan one seemingly about to disembark on Crete, while the Yugoslav one has reached the Messenia region of the Peloponnese.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we see the reduced empire of the Pandya. They gave Tiruneveli to Bengal last episode, which now has them firmly boxed in in southern India. Their army still looks decent, but they aren’t gonna break out with that. Especially as the Afghans still haven’t concluded peace yet. Pandya is already being visited by some peoples for afar - Kokangese, Kilwans, Zulus, Han Chinese, even Yolngu. Heck, even though proximity would suggest that black-and-white trireme in the Bay of Bengal to be Aghani, I cannot completely dismiss the possibility that it might be Maori. Afterall, how would an Afghani trireme arrive there undamaged, when the two civs are still at war?</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Brazilian settler, hoping to expand his civ north of Recife, got cockblocked by a Muisca settler, who founded Ubate on what was no doubt the same spot the Brazilian settler wanted. Worse, some of the nearest other settleable locations are already blocked by Kuikuro borders or a Chilean worker. Brazil isn’t doing good, that’s for sure. Their enemy, the Inca, had managed to go through Kuikuro territory and send a settler towards the Caribbean. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Over in eastern Europe, our main focus is Kyivan Rus’ taking up the Nomadic Horde as its form of government. Given the open steppes that make up most of their territory rn, this may not be a bad or weird choice. </p><p></p><p>We also get a look at their neighbours. Turkey seems largely empty of military units, focused as its army is on Egypt, Vladimir isn’t doing much of anything, Lithuania is sporting a respectable army, and Yugoslavia is sitting around with its army, skirmishing with Brandenburg near Ljubljana and Zagreb. </p><p></p><p>I have no idea how that Brandenburger horseman survived its way to the outskirts of Ljubljana, but it doesn’t seem like he’s long for this world anyways. For being a war between two of Europe’s three major powers, the Yugoslav-Brandenburg war is remarkably boring. </p><p></p><p>Off in the corner, we also see the Permyans attacking Balanjar, with minimal success. </p>"

Most of the states visible on this and the next few slides are still tribes, tho some have developed a dominant faction, and a few more even switched to a different governmental form. </p><p></p><p>Angola is dominated by its nobles, while populists run the show in Bengal. The Anglo-Norse, to cope with their defeats against Brandenburg last episode, have become a monarchy, dominated by nobles, while the Anglo-Dutch organized themselves, oddly, into a nomadic horde, dominated by its settlements.

Headcanon time: Isabella found out that Virrhea replaces Castile with a void on the maps, and was so angered by what was essentially a meme that she decided to go to war in a bid of relevancy, to force Virrhea to put Castile on the map. Iiiiiiiiiiit isn’t gonna work. </p><p></p><p>More personally relevant to me, we see a much clearer shot of Titograd. IRL, Titograd was the socialist-era name of Podgorica. Podgorica is my hometown. So it comes as no surprise that I love seeing my hometown in this game, even if it's at a completely different location than historically. Yugoslav may it forever stay in the cylinder. Titograd. </p><p></p><p>Other stuff on this slide? Well, a Malian scout has actually approached Capua, suffering damage in the process. A Yugoslav settler is moving into Tunisia.

Ming troops, Maori and Philippine scouts and a mountain block the most direct route for both civs, leaving the area between Longbian and the Tibetan plateau as the most obvious area of combat. However, both sides don't have much in the way of troops in this area. Kokang especially is gonna struggle with pulling in reinforcements due to all the mountains. </p>"

Two warriors are the city’s only defence from the oncoming invasion, and a third one is uselessly swimming in the gulf of Thailand. Any potential Philippine reinforcements are stuck behind a traffic jam of Timorese and Kokangese ships in the southernmost part of the South China sea. Even if they somehow navigate the winding path between them, the first units to arrive will be embarked land units - useless in a naval engagement. And that’s ignoring the very real possibility that future moves by Timor-Leste and Kokang might completely block off the path. </p>"

However, the presence of rivers, marshes, forest and jungle is still sure to slow down any attack.

They rally whatever troops (mostly composite bowmen) they can to defend what’s left of their nation, and put them under the command of Kittur Chennamma. The situation is getting increasingly desparate. Yemeni archers and Chadian composite bowmen and charioteers have reduced Akhetaten to deep red. All it would take for the capital to fall would be one melee unit. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately for the Egyptians, though, the coalition neglected to put any melee units in capturing range. There is one Chadian spearman two tiles away, but he is uselessly fortified at a bend on the Nile, even facing the wrong direction. Even if he wasn’t fortified and wasn’t blocked by one of his own composite archers, a hill and a river crossing are sure to slow down his advance a few turns. Less through the effectiveness of Kittur Chennamma and more through the incompetence of the coalition, Akhetaten still survives, and seems like it will for the foreseeable future. </p><p></p><p>Another impromptu history lesson: </p><p>IRL Kittur Chennama was a queen-consort, then queen-mother, and then regent of the princely state of Kittur in modern-day Karnataka, the largely Kannada-speaking state in southern India. During the 1820s, she led two revolts against the British, and actually seems to have been partially successful in the first one, kicking the British out after multiple victories in late October 1824, tho she was ultimately defeated in her second revolt in the following years, dying as a prisoner in 1829, likely of disease, tho folk legends in the area claim she swallowed the diamond on her ring after hearing the news that her lieutenant, who continued the struggle after her capture by the British, was himself captured, ending the revolt. </p>"

Until now, the Comanche have managed to keep back the Mohave at the mountain passes and even crossed the Rio Grande, but now that is all over. The Arapaho have nothing but plains, a handful of rivers and maybe 2 hills in the way of their conquest. It’s possible that the Comanche settle of Penateka, which cut Tecenoo’s direct connections with the rest of the Arapaho Empire, spurred Pretty Nose into action. It’s also possible that this is a religious crusade - an early form of nationalism has been tied with the Arapaho faith of Nestorianism by the rhetoric of Pretty Nose herself, and this invasion could be seen as a way to do away with Peyotism, a faith no doubt considered at least heretical, and at most half-heathen to devout Nestorians. The fact that a prophet, Thomas Aquinas, is following the army in its march south would suggest the latter the case. Or it could just be that Pretty Nose noticed a relatively easy opportunity for expansion and just took it. It may even be that all three of these reasons - cutting-off of settlements, religious zeal, and opportunistic expansionism - are all working in tandem here. In any case, things aren’t looking good for the Comanche now. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Over here, we see the new Afghan settle of Lashkargah, right under the noses of the Massagetae army. Completely undefended. Not a good spot to settle given the current circumstances, but if Massagetae chooses to ignore this for now, and Afghanistan either sends or builds a decent garrison, this could prove to be a nice jumping-off point further into Central Asia or the Iranian plateau. </p><p></p><p>As for the Massagetae, if they choose not to go after the defenseless Lashkargah, but still want to use their army on something, may I suggest sniping Khazar Derbent from under the Permyans’ noses? Or maybe heading into Khorasan and stealing Yemen’s far-flung colony of Asir? </p>"

    narration: "<p>Regrettably for Afghanistan, Turkey has given up on destroying Nineveh, preferring to keep it instead and solidify their newfound dominance over the Orient. </p><p></p><p>Disappointed by this, but still wanting to make the best of the situation, Durrani had his settler in Fars settle in Fars, founding Mazar-i-Sharif, while the settler in the Gulf of Oman crossed the Gulf of Oman and landed in Oman, founding Taloqan. Yemen is probably regretting their lack of settling in Arabia right around now. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of Arabia, the two Egyptian composite bowmen are nowhere to be found. I assume they were caught by the Turkish army and the supporting Yemeni contingent and slaughtered. Poor souls. RIP. </p>"

    narration: "<p>And here we see the result of the Inca-Brazilian peace deal that you may have noticed on the sidebar last slide. Brazil gave away its second and also largest city, São Salvador, away. Worse still, Kayapó has settled Mekrãgnoti between Rio de Janeiro and Recife. I’m sorry to say this, but Brazil’s stint in the royale is as good as over. Pedro II may have once led this great civilization to victory in Mk2, but Pedro I has via combination of his own decisions and things out of his control lost any chances of even regional prominence. Going forward, Brazil is gonna be a two-city rump, playing last fiddle to the other powers of South America. Mostly to their most immediate neighbours, the populous Kayapó and the continental powerhouse that the Inca have now confirmed themselves to be. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Huh, it seems like Sundiata actually read my earlier slide? A large army, complete with a general, is being sent over the Sahara, presumably to capture Capua. Another army also seems to be gathered to reinforce the war effort, led by general Arsaces I, who seems to have been personally appointed by Sundiata after a ceremony in Niani. </p><p></p><p>Historically, Arsaces was the leader of the Parni tribe, a nomadic Iranic tribe from the Dahae confederacy in what is now Turkmenistan. After Andragoras, the Iranian satrap of Parthia, and Diodotus, the Greek satrap of Bactria, successfully revolted against Seleucid rule and formed independent kingdoms, Arsaces led the Parni in a war of conquest against the former, overthrowing Andragoras and declaring himself king of Parthia. He went on to establish a strong state structure, which several generations later, under his great-grandnephew Mithridates I (yes, the one from CBRX S1) grew into an empire. </p><p></p><p>And that brings us to the end of another episode of the CBRX S3. I hope you enjoyed this. Give some commentary, constructive criticism and other feedback in the comments. Sorry if this felt a bit rushed, I’m having a busy two weeks between the 7th and the 21st of November, what with this narration, studying for at least two exams, going to uni even beside the exams twice, and celebrating both my and two cousins’ birthdays, so I wanted to finish this narration (barring the OC and PR slides) as quickly as possible. </p><p></p><p>I hope you have a nice day, week, month, etc. This is BV, signing off. </p>"
