    narration: "<p>Hello world! Welcome to Episode 3 of CBRX Season 3. My name is Captain Bohemian, and I am excited to make my narrating debut for you all today. I have been a fan of the CBR since the days when The Buccaneers held a slice of Africa and “How To Fight Wars Good” was merely a rough draft, so I consider it a huge honor to help chronicle this event. Without further ado, let’s sail into parts unknown…</p>"

If the AI actually makes use of that function, they can save their precious production in the early game for making military units.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Arianism is the faith of Timor-Leste. Their units get better healing and combat strength near their cities, making them a tougher nut to crack than one might expect.</p>"

While it may be a slow war of attrition, he’s confident he’ll unite his peninsula under one flag soon enough.

It doesn’t matter who they are or where they come from—Cambodian, Bengali, Göktürk, Lithuanian, Massagetaen, Tuvan, North Korean, Permian—all fear the invaders that may someday reach them and their homes.
