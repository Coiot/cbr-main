That’s Sardinia.” Guiscard has so far decided to not embrace the shadowy lands, as he settled his first city in Greece, and seems to be sending more settlers out there. Or sending them towards Sardinia. Either way, more cities is good.</p>"

Unfortunately, Frederick has only been looking at real-world maps and did not realize that, in this game, London is in France. He also seems to be keeping a large portion of his military in Potsdam and Berlin, which unfortunately for him are not The Hague.</p>"

They have almost no military, but luckily for them neither does any of the other civs within striking distance… except for Willie Seaweed, whose large military consists largely of archers. And also is separated by the Rocky Mountains. Note the last word, “mountains”, which is a synonym for “site for a meatgrinder war” in these parts.</p>"

Now that I think about it, Cavite el Viejo is actually in a well-defensible location. Defensible in the sense that it is hard to attack, not in the sense that it’s easy to send a backup military to.

Assyria looks only vaguely well-equipped to handle this attack: Ataturk has a lot more force, but this is an early-game war where one country has a military force to speak of. Do you expect the AI to be competent? Hopefully neither civ gets distracted by the war, as a disconcerting amount of civs seem to be too lazy to settle.</p>"

Any potential second-in-commands have probably fled to Europe as to avoid getting killed when the capital gets taken due to the lack of military forces. </p><p></p><p>On the focal point of this slide is the Modoc-Mohave war.

    narration: "<p>Mori is an exciting civ with a lot of historical background to it, and North Korea is a civ that got voted in for being funny nuke man. They do have a good army, comprised of soldiers from well-off nuclear families. The Ming are mingling around in their part of the world. The Ainu are in this game. This region is peaceful for now, one of the last vestiges where neighbors aren’t at war.</p>"

    narration: "<p>While Botswana is preoccupied with fighting off Angola, Cetshwayo siezes his chance to strike at the undefended back flank of Botswana. Once he gets his large army through the mountains, this could spell game over for Gaborone. It could also spell something else, like “failure”.  </p>"

They still need to pull themselves up a bit more, but they’re turning out much better than usual (again, thanks to their better AI in these tests). </p>"

Or if the Cree move their military down south to fight against the Arapaho. Given how messed up the Western United States are in terms of military, they may soon bring law, order, and plentiful seaweed to southern lands.</p>"

In the south, you can see a fifth settler, perhaps getting ready to settle Sri Lanka. Maybe even adventure in Australia. As this region isn’t too strong militarily, they have plenty of time to settle.</p>"

Given how the Anglo-Norse are, I think this is a good choice, as Vladimir is looking weak, and the Anglo-Norse will probably get taken care of eventually in the European mess.
