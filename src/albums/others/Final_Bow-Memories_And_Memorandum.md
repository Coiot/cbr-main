  narration: "<p>Hello everyone! LunarNeedle here on behalf of Blue Cassette to look back on all the memories we made; included is a grand eulogy of every fallen Civ and a super quick view on how Brazil managed to defy fate and challenge the Orange Ryk and succeed where all others have failed. The Green Menace, once on the edge of losing to the pirate hoard that dominated South America, took each and every capital in the world from Greenland to New Zealand. But, considering this is a memories episode, let’s see the path that that Pedro walked on his way for global domination.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Way back when the world was full of life, was the very first war dropped by Leonidas of Sparta; angered by the brazen forward settle, something that would become more prevalent later. Leonidas was amazing an army while likely Rome were constructing buildings. Remember this, this pattern of production will come back later with more dangerous consequences.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Despite the first war being over Cumae being settled in the face of Sparta, it would be another risky forward settle of Neapolis to be the first city flip of the Royale. We could see Brazil be at their weakest now with any factors being capable of altering fate, and altering who would hold the trophy. But alas, they survive...</p>"

  narration: "<p>...A fate not given to Rome, as their forward settles created hateful neighbours, allowing even Carthage to seize Roman clay as the empire fell. This area would become incredibly hotly contested for the duration of the game. Of note in this slide: Yakutia in Siberia are very large, Boer’s are beginning to amass troops for an eventual Kongo invasion and some powers are beginning to project power. But who would come out on top in the shuffle?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Considering the high naval bias, and the overall long border, it would take a modernized Boer army to recognize the weakness of Kongo to capitalize. Something that would help ascend them past the ranks of the others. In other words, now was the time for any of their heavily militarized neighbours like Ethiopia to take a strike, something Haile Selassie would do when it was far too late to resist.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It would be far too late to resist the Boer’s at this point. Possessing a rather immense infrastructure bonus, they turned the useless tiles around their many cities into hubs of production and food. It would be this, along with the high overall prioritisation of production that would aid Boer’s ascension past the mortal nations around them. Of note: Finland has began to take advantage of the Huns capacities to raise cities and the USSR’s prioritizations of the useless snow cities to settle border gore to the east of Russia proper. This would be the first taste of border gore for Urho Kekkonen. Something he would carry for the remainder of the game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Boer’s sweeped past the Mali in one part, and would take a few more parts to secure a stable hold onto East Asia despite Henry Morgan's refusal to give up the key coastal ports. It would be the later strength provided by key wonders like Skynet that would encourage Boer’s to challenge the seen number two in the world; Vietnam. People had already called the game for Boer’s by this point. We were just waiting for the credit roll… Right?</p>"

  narration: "<p>It would be a plague spreading over the Boer Ryk that would begin to choke the beast from the inside as outdated units flooded the lands, chugging turn times and halting production, causing the front to stop right before Asia proper. This would be as far as the Boers would be allowed to go. It would be a few turns of total peace, where the units stationed in his lands thanks to a open border agreement would disappear, flung to the far reaches of the world. Was this just a vacation, or were they scoping out their future lands?</p>"

  narration: "<p>With the drop of a gauntlet and powerful allies, it would be this war declaration that would finally wound the beast, where all the Boer’s gains against Vietnam would evaporate and the hotly contested coastline of East Asia would see a new challenger approach the gates, taking all of Mali’s old land, beginning to bear down on the Boer Ryk. The machine turning out units would not stop, as is given a directive to keep on producing Biotroopers and Paratroopers until the end.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The grip was truly shown when with a snap of his fingers, a seemingly mundane war declaration meant the end of Sweden’s painfully earned gains. It would be this menace forcing the peace of Sibir and Iceland against Sweden, but Brazil does not do such gifts without a price. It would take two parts for all of Sweden’s European holdings to become green. There was now two footholds on Boer’s front door full of troops. The result, well...</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sixty-nine turns later, the king of the Royale, the since truely undefeated champion of the Royale took a mortal blow to the core as he lost all of his Middle Eastern holdings, and enough of Africa to lose his capital. Of the ashes of the Boer Ryk gave birth to a new God, and this God had one goal, total domination. It would be Inuit; the undisputed second place world power now that Boer’s are out the picture; that would be the next to fall with startling precision. Thanks to Buccaneers nuclear assault onto south North American coastland, it wouldn’t take long for the Inuit capital to fall. By this point, it was obvious. The Green Lands in Europe and the Middle East were beginning to be full of modern infantry and XCOMs; it would be mere moments before Brazil pointed at people and killed them with the same devastation that the Inuit witnessed. The call was given from Nebuchadnezzar himself. Commence total war. It’s time to test the new God.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over one hundred turns later, it would be every single empire collapsing against the Carnival, a culture focused base game Civilization, to take every other capital. This would be the final breath of competition as the crown and cup were given to the world's next god. Nebuchadnezzar, like you, waited years to see the worlds conclusion. And through rebirth and change, the world remained turning. This was it. This was Brazil's destiny.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh Brazil, you were once deemed to be too lazy to defeat the Inca, a war that would last for majority of the game with no conclusion, and who would eventually be taken and conquered by the Buccaneers. You were brought to your knees and were considered dead when you declared war with the Orange Containment Project. Yet you survived, with your wall of cyber subs and paratrooper units. People were so amazed when you captured a city in east Africa for a series of turns against the Boer’s. Little did they knew, this would be the future as your green carpet spread over the world. Many others perished before you, and yet you survived. Godspeed, Emperor Pedro! You are Nebuchadnezzar’s sole survivor.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The reason, as demonstrated by /u/edse1991, was your desire to build units over all. As Buccaneers partied on their flotilla of carriers, you amassed soldiers. While the Boers and Vietnam were fighting each other, you amassed more soldiers. While Sibir and Vietnam wasted the turns away in the mountains in pursuit of a large empire, you cultivated units. And now that the world is on fire and no one is left, they have the audacity to ask for mercy? Memes aside, it was this reason the game was over. There were so many units wasting away in pointless wars, while Pedro just sat and waited until his army choked the life out of his neighbors, and executed his decree that all cities are Brazilian territory. And like a sword, his units swayed by the unwavering influence of their leader, marched onwards to their death. They, not Pedro, won the war. Each and every citizen of Brazil was sacrificed for the greater good. They were the true heroes.</p><p></p><p>Now now, instead of talking about how Brazil defied the odds and challenged a God and won, we need to talk about those who fought valiantly for their cause and failed their quest. Written by the CBR community under incredibly tight time restraints, the final eulogies. Take it away!</p>"

  narration: "<p>“The Zamburaks of Afghanistan were sadly not enough in Mk. 2. The impressive showing of Mirwais Hotak in Mk. 1 was so phenomenal, that is just what it was. A Phenomenon. Although Afghanistan held in Kabul with two other cities protecting it from a meatgrinder of different civs, it was not until the Sibirian Hordes and the Vietnamese descended on what was originally a top 10 civilization that the Graveyard of Empires became its own Graveyard. Regardless, we cannot help but be impressed by this civilization. They grew beyond their means, reaching every mountainous region of Asia and becoming one of the largest civilizations in the early game. Even later on, Afghanistan was still a large enough power to contend with its rivals, like Persia.</p><p></p><p>A secret fan favourite, Afghanistan will live on in our hearts as a civilization that could have done so much more, but did too little for it to matter. Perhaps in a distant mark, we can see the other Afghanistan take a shot at it, and maybe we can get the Afghani domination that we had all been seeking. Rest Easy, Mirwais Hotak.” - jmangelo67</p>"

Having only stretched to central North America with brief grasp of the harsh marshes of Florida and food rich Great Lakes, it was never really on Lincoln’s side. He was pincered by the ocean bearing Buccaneers denying meaningful ocean expansion and the aggressive Canadians bearing down on bereft American armies with great impudence, sending your ebony ashes of you empire to the shore, as you rose to the stars to meet your creator. Your valiance was beautiful, and your rise to hold onto Cincinatti ten parts later was beautiful. Regardless of anything, you always waved the flag of Freedom. God speed, Abraham Lincoln. You shaped the history of the Inuit, Canada and the entire game. F.” - LunarNeedle</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Some civs seem really boring until you look into them in more detail, and can chart their journey more thoroughly. Arabia is not one of those nations. Their first foray into global relevance was losing Baghdad to Persia, a loss that most people predicted would eventually be reversed - and never was. Instead, Arabia warred with the Ayyubids and Israel, neither to much effect. Eventually, most shots of the Arabian peninsula were of the strange territory of Batticaloa, a Sri Lankan-founded city that turned surprisingly Finnish (and remained so against all odds for most of history). Their starting location certainly influenced their lack of opportunities - Mecca was a sizeable city, but their other towns were underfed desert settlements. One day, Arabia turned another shade of green - at least, that's how fast it seemed to most readers, as Ethiopia declared war on Arabia and completely defeated them almost instantaneously, in what was the most efficient use of paratroopers seen up to that point. Later, most of the cities they founded would be blown into smithereens by Boer and Vietnamese nukes. A fitting coda, really.” - Lacsirax Ariscal</p>"

  narration: "<p>“On paper, Perón did terribly - the first civ to die on their continent, and no major wins to speak of. But Argentina were virtually cornered from the start, with a start that necessitated a thin empire of spread out cities, wedged between the roomier homelands of Brazil, Chile and the Inca. They even squeezed a city into Guyana, but the Buccs made short work of Parana. Argentina were an active co-participant in the never-ending wars between Brazil and Inca, even taking the Inca city of Machu momentarily. But Brazil responded to this by declaring war on Argentina themselves, and Chile followed suit. Sandwiched between two larger powers, Argentina was completely doomed, and soon the only lingering legacy of Peron's reign was the irritatingly misspelt city of “Neeuquen” - and another super-volatile border, this time between Brazil and Chile.” - Lacsirax Ariscal</p>"

  narration: "<p>“The Yang to Finland's Yin, Armenia had accomplished so much when it was still relevant. Originally ordained to be a bottom feeder, Armenia made one move that made it jump in the rankings with the chance of success: It settled south. Then all of Armenia's fans, few in number they may have been, rejoiced. The civilization had killed Israel twice, had practically killed the USSR, and was very close to killing off Finland even though Armenia itself was down to its last city.</p><p></p><p>The Enclavia to Finland's Exclavia. The last stand in Gaza was pitiful, but let us not forget that this civilization bruised its way to the center of the power rankings on more than one occasion. And even when Armenia was down to three cities, people still knew it was possible for Armenia to throw a few more punches before dying. Bravo, Tiridates III” - jmangelo67</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Having been a fan of the Maori at the start and a Vietnam supporter more recently, Australia was always a bit of a boogeyman, but it’s hard not to respect them. Sure, Parkes got a bad rap from the sub after seeing multiple continental invasions fall apart in the Americas and Vietnam - but at least Australia was playing to win, taking down their neighbors with ruthless efficiency, keeping a unit carpet at all times (hello Boers) and remaining at war almost constantly. And throughout it all they never left humanity behind, marching their good ol’ diggers through the streets as other nations descended into scientific travesty.</p><p></p><p>Brazilian green may have replaced Australian green, but Australia was undeniably the first cultural superpower, spreading the good word of Autocracy to all the nations of the cylinder. Well, relevant nations (sorry Tibet). And their initial success in the last war with ‘Nam was an early demonstration of the power of peacekeeper invasions. </p><p></p><p>Plus they outlived every nation that ever beat or mocked them, so that helps.

  narration: "<p>“Ahh (or should I say Ayy?) the Ayyubids. They could've been a true force were it not for Israel blocking their religion, leading to what was probably the most famous religion to observers with their 24-hour Party Pope, although he and his religion never really took off on the cylinder itself. In power playing fashion they founded Dvin right on the Suez canal, leading to much delight within the fandom but they never really capitalized on it. Just as Israel blocked them with their religions, Ethiopia blocked them. Period. That's not saying they weren't a force to be reckoned with at some point. Around part ~20 they were probably the stongest northern African civ, what with Morroco merely being involved in land skirmishes and Carthage being run by Hannibal.” - abkagd</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Paul Kruger was more than a man. He was a god, once. In his cybernetic grip, he steered the Boer Ryk to unimaginable heights. Once only a small agrarian people, threatened by regional powers such as the Zulu and the Congolese, the Boers steadily grew stronger and more advanced with every conquest. Never will the world forget the sudden annihilation of the Ethiopians, or the valiant defense against multiple world leaders during the Orange Containment Projects. They were truly destined for greatness, and the Skynet Singularity made them a force to be feared worldwide. If I had been told 30 parts ago that the CBR would be ending soon in a global conflict, I would've bet my bottom dollar on the Boers coming out on top.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, the Boers's time-tested tactic of defending and growing left them shockingly ill-prepared for the threat of Brazil. The fall of Pretoria was the moment we all knew that there was no chance for recovery. Reducing this once-mighty empire to a single Antarctic outpost, and then leaving them to rot for years before finally finishing them off, was nothing less than a slap to the face. From South Africa to the Iberian Peninsula to the Middle East and India, the Boers in their height deserved nothing less than the #1 spot in the power rankings, week after week. There was once a time where many began to ask: “Why can't we just end the game now and declare the Boers the victors? No one could possibly compete against them!” But all was for naught. And so, for Paul Kruger, we remember: the game isn't over, until it's over.” - Captain Bohemian</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Henry Morgan once led a pirate crew that stretched from FloridARRRRR to the northern half of South America, and spanned from PanamARRRRR to West AfricARRRRR and the former home of Maria the Mad. He was a legend in this world, even being Pedro’s equal during some earlier moments in the game. But, once Pedro sold his magnanimous soul, Morgan’s empire slowly began to crumble. However, despite Morgan having enemies all around him, he never gave up his home islands. That is, until the true War to End All Wars arrived. All of the preparation that was made for a final battle between Morgan and his old adversary seemed to be for nothing, as the final Buccaneer holdings were taken over by the Carnival in the blink of an eye. Honestly, Pedro must have offered the Buccs all the rum they could ever want in exchange for total domination. Sadly, even Henry Morgan himself fell under the spell of the Carnival, as the final Buccaneer city of La Habana was placed under Brazilian control after Morgan’s first taste of Brazilian rum. Rumors quickly spread that Pedro even let Morgan host his own personal Carnival, where the drunken pirate would never stop partying with his crew. Even if Morgan would want it to stop, there would be no end to the Carnival. It would be a spectacular but unwanted party that would last forever.</p><p></p><p>Hey, everyone, this is Algernon Charles Swinburne from the Discord server (or u/Volticore on the sub). Because I feel like my words cannot truly describe my appreciation for the Buccs, I will be brief. Henry Morgan’s Buccaneers were a fan favorite that were known for pulling off incredible AI feats, creating the greatest fleet of carriers in existence, and just being an absolute madman in general. You were fun to watch, Morgan. Thank you for your efforts. Have another F.</p><p></p><p>By the way, did I mention that I couldn’t get Copacabana out of my head when writing this?</p><p>Oh god.

  narration: "<p>“Often pencilled in as one of the most forgettable civs in Mk 2, Burma kept to themselves for much of history, founding a juicy canal city in Mandalay and then failing to capitalise on it. They constructed the Colossus in Rangoon, and apparently decided the best way of enhancing those trade bonuses would be to stay as pacifist as possible, even founding the state religion of pacifism, Jainism Buddhism. This commitment to peace was so great than when they did find themselves at war, they’d give up anything to secure a peace treaty, including the cities of Mawlamyine and Bago. Ultimately, Vietnam’s neighbours all went the same way, and eventually Burma ran out of cities to gift; their fall paved the way for Vietnam’s rapid western expansion. Still, the religion they founded remained a local powerhouse, and they kept a small but devoted following in the community.” - Unknown Author</p>"

Alexios spent many years in a simple and irrelevant existence on Crimea, watching how many civs crashed and burned. But he didn't want to follow that path: instead of choosing a long life of misery, he chose to be the first civ to suicide, dying in a blaze of glory trying to defeat one of the great powers of the cylinder: Finland. It was Alexios that invented suicide by Kekkonen, dragging the Huns along with him in an iconic civ moment. </p><p></p><p>In the end, that it was distinguished Byzantium from other irrelevant rump states, Alexios preferred the dignity of a glorious death instead of the long miserable life of so many other civs.” - SD.Chile</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Alas for thee, Canada! From the start, you seemed to be a competitor to win, the glory days of Canifest Destiny from the CBR MK1 heralding great things. Indeed, times of greatness were heralded. For an unbroken string of four parts, between Part 9 and Part 12, Canada held first place in the Power Rankings. After the momentary dip to eleventh in Part 4, it would take until Part 20 for Canada to fall out of the top ten in the rankings. Even as time passed on, Canada would remain in the top 20 civs as late as Part 58, shortly before their demise five parts later. Those who remember the days of Canifest Destiny will recall the fall of Washington, the defeat of the American forces, the push westward into Sioux territory, a disastrous war with Texas, and the various wars with the Inuit. Despite defeating the Inuit the first time with riflemen facing down infantry, when war came for the second time, no amount of pluckiness, artillery, or sheer willpower could stop the blizzard. After the Inuit collapsed the Texan front, the borders closed in, and Canada was pushed back to Hamilton, where they made their last stand. There they fell, with nothing but a few ships remaining to their name.” - Kang Youwei</p>"

They started off at 42 out of 61, expected to fold along with Morocco and the Ayyubids in one of the most crowded areas on the map.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't so. Hannibal's strategic brilliance lived on, netting Carthage victory after victory despite their technological disadvantage. Hannibal's prowess led to Carthage becoming an empire that spanned from Algeria to Egypt, and a formidable one at that. It was one fatal mistake that did him in however, winning the battle of Bilbais but losing the war as swarms of far stronger Ethiopian troops flooded into his lands. Nothing could save the general now, and Carthage fell quickly to Ethiopia and Morocco.</p><p></p><p>But their legacy lives on. Not only have their tactics been taught by many across the cylinder, including the same nations that killed Carthage, they ranked far above what their untimely demise brought them, a true testament to one of the greatest generals of antiquity.” - Chukens</p>"

  narration: "<p>“More than any other nation, Chile's history was indelibly tied to the mighty Brazil. In Mk 1 Chile was a breakout star, conquering territory as far adrift as West Africa - but Mk 2 Chile was far more concerned with the home continent, scrapping with their three immediate neighbours near-constantly. Their first major success was against Argentina, who they devoured with Brazil, with Pedro taking most of the territory but O'Higgins holding the crucial capital, Buenos Aires. The two nations would fight over the remains for decades to come, the border between the two frequently shifting. Meanwhile, the Buccs were reaching their apex, taking the strain off Chile's depleted armies in their fights with Brazil (as Brazil hit the lowest point in their history with major losses to the Buccaneers), but also allowing them to join in with the pirates' invasion of the feeble Inca, with Chile once again grabbing less land but finding the capital. But Brazil sought to regain face after their defeat against Morgan, and their next war with Chile was far more efficient; a coalition with Australia would finally put the nail in O'Higgins' coffin.” - Lacsirax Ariscal</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Mao’s China had the praise of the world. They were highly ranked in the power rankings, and it was expected that they would do well. Sure, they had settled two of their cities in a far off region of Siberia, and Vietnam forward settling was rampant, but one good war would fix that! But the war Vietnam declared forever sealed Mao from his dreams of being a top leader of the world, and he lost everything to a variety dish of powers soon enough.</p><p></p><p>Or, so one would think. Despite being reduced to a two city rump north of Vietnam, China’s story didn’t end there. Mao proceeded to troll Vietnam, essentially acting as the Mongols to Vietnam’s China-like state. They hassled them even when Vietnam was facing a national crisis and took a power ranking hit. They grew to a 4 city state from taking Vietnam’s cities when they couldn’t defend them. This won China many followers, and combined with their fun joke entries at the start of the power rankings, they became a plucky low rank hero.</p><p></p><p>While they faced a slow-motion carve-up after their peak, with 1 city being lost at a time, their reputation remained, and their stubborn survival was loved. Their power ranking entries became a running joke by this time. And as such, it was a tragedy when China finally fell to Korea in part 49.” - Docsy</p>"

Almost immediately they were one of the lucky 7 civs to found a religion, already cementing their position in the CBR's history. And with remarkable intelligence Halie Selassie conquered his way into owning a third of Africa, and upon Morocco's death, became one of the last two African civs to still be alive, despite the looming shadow of the Boers hanging over (or perhaps under) them. But it was not to last, for when the first OCP started Ethiopia joined the side against the Boers, an opportunistic albeit fatal mistake which brought a brutal end to not only them, but to an entire era in the cylinder's history. Ethiopia did extremely well for the position they were put into, carving a large empire from the coasts of Algeria to the hot sands of Arabia, all the more impressive when powers the likes of the Boers and Vietnam stood at their doorstep. They may have fallen when they were at their strongest, but they will be remembered as the last and greatest stronghold against Boer dominance.” (Chukens]</p>"

Unlike Poland or the USSR who pretty quickly revealed they were not going to be a factor in this game, France started strong with the potential to be a contender. There is an alternate universe where France takes the initiative and rules a European empire. Maybe even an empire to rival the Boers. Of all the civs France is possibly the one to squander their start the most.</p><p></p><p>They started ranked 18th and for a civ on the most crowded continent, that’s an achievement. Only Poland and the USSR ranked higher on the European continent. France was higher than eventual powerhouses Sweden, Iceland, and freaking Sparta. They looked like they were gonna meet those expectations as well. They snipped cities from Germany and Rome, while keeping neighbors like Portugal and England in check, they were an early European power and looked posed to strike civs like Sweden or Britain, possibly even an attack on the weaker powers in Africa, to set up a base down there and hem in Portugal for a kill.</p><p></p><p>But then they just stopped. Almost as if Napoleon looked at his acquired lands and said, “Yeah, this is enough. We can’t have unhappiness problems, that simply will not do!” Ireland took the chance to attack Britain and France did nothing. Sweden and Sparta started consolidating their power and France did nothing. Portugal was attacked by the Pirates from the west, and France still did nothing. The opportunities for France were fewer and fewer each day on the cylinder. By the time Iceland established itself as a European power with the Icelandic Isles. France just couldn’t do anything. And they knew it. Rather than wait for Iceland or Sweden to get bored of them one day, France took an honorable suicide and declared war on Iceland. Losing every city in 2 parts and giving Iceland an official foothold on the continent, starting the eternal rivalry of Sweden VS Iceland. France’s ending speaks volumes about their performance is the CBR. They had the path to victory practically gift wrapped for them and their biggest contribution was dying so other civs could flourish.” - Logical-knot</p>"

He can decimate your cities in the early game and he'll fight you forever unless you crush him. He was ranked 17th in the original power rankings, above Vietnam, Sibir, and Finland. We were expecting a civ that would last well into the mid game, and possible even become an empire like the Buccs or Sweden. And he started off well, fighting off Sibir and striking at the heart of the USSR. So how did this civ fall so far?</p><p></p><p>Well, you could blame it on a couple things. His enemies in Finland and Sibir were much stronger than anyone expected. Sibir was just a filler civ they needed to fill space in that area and no one thought Finland was going to survive past part 20, let alone become some sort of super state. The technology gap also didn’t help. Attila’s UA is the scariest thing on the cylinder but the returns become diminishing once you more past the classical era. But really, you and I both know the real reason the huns fell so fast and easily. Attila had a habit of burning the cities he acquired. In the game of empires, it’s generally not a good idea to take all your acquired territory and resources and just chuck them in the trash. Especially when that territory is the only thing between you and an upcoming world power in Sibir. Attila literally took a city off Stalin, burned it to the ground and then made peace. At which point, Stalin built a city in that exact same spot! Nice going Attila. I’m not gonna say you didn’t deserve the place you got but I enjoyed your escapades.

  narration: "<p>“Iceland’s path to victory was fairly muddled. Iceland started basically alone with pretty terrible land and expansion opportunities few and difficult. They started by settling in Greenland, which was a good start but from there, things got tricky. To the west was the Inuit, but they were set up to a major world power so making enemies with them was probably a bad idea. That left the British/Irish Isles as the only real option to expand, but both of them were going to be building armies to deal with each on the island. Just waltzing in and taking the capital was not an option. They needed to be patient and wait for one of them to overextend. When Ireland waged a war and took the British lands, Iceland saw their chance. They took the Isles in a quick, fierce attack and established the Icelandic isles.</p><p></p><p>This made everyone give them a second look but they still weren’t in a great spot. They were powerful but still only had the Isles as a base of operations on the European continent, with Sweden, Sparta and Finland looking very closely at their new neighbor. They needed an easy foothold they could grab quickly. Like say, a nation like France declaring suicide and basically giving Iceland all of its lands in a couple parts. When Iceland got a base on the main continent and basically became a European power, Iceland suddenly became a huge contender for not just Europe but the whole world.</p><p></p><p>And they would only get stronger, when the Boer menace started expanding its influence, Iceland sided with them, knowing that the only way to secure Europe was not to have an enemy at your backside. They would participate in the partition of Finland, Later backstabbing their ally, Sweden. Containing the swedes influence on the continent. They then backstabbed the Boers and set up a base in Africa. This was the height of their power. Unfortunately it would not last. Iceland couldn’t get past Sweden. Even with Boer assistance, they couldn’t crush the thorn in its side and being bought out by Big Carrier certainly didn’t help. Now Sweden couldn’t get them either so they weren’t in any danger but they both just sat there. Staring. Wasting resources until the Carnival came for them both, destroying them in the same turn, a fitting end. I sometimes wonder what would have happened had Sweden and Iceland teamed up, maybe attack Sibir or even the Boers. Would they have been prepared for Brazil? We’ll never know but for a start that everyone assumed needed in annihilation, Iceland did a pretty good job!” - Logical-Knot</p>"

They would even be semi-successful in their efforts against the Ashanti, contributing to the coalition war that extinguished the Empire of the Golden Stool. They remained perplexed by Morocco's ability to hold onto Kumasi and Mampong, however, denying Kongo further expansion into West Africa - and while they briefly gained control of a city in Iberia, through an iconically mad peace treaty, they soon lost that to Morocco too. Instead, they were left to fend off the Boers, already one of the most threatening nations on the Cylinder but with an as-yet-untested army. Kongo did manage to flip a Boer city or two, and clung on to their exclave Kakongo far longer than expected, but the war only ever had one expected resolution.

Unfortunately, his best efforts did not please the Babylonian overlords. “A civilization with practically no accomplishments”, “Nothingburger”, “Watching them was a pain because it was too boring”, “an utter disappointment”, “cricket chirps”, this was the sub’s reaction to their survival. </p><p></p><p>Desperate to curry favor, and realizing the success Carthage had with elephant invasion, Akbar had the Mughals create an elephant hauled cannon, but they came at such a great coast, and had so little movement, they were reduced to primarily display pieces, and the Babylonians went unpleased. Disturbed by the uncaring masters of this universe, and the constant threat of invasion, Akbar finally made a decision not for us watchers, but for his people, he made the decision to adopt Freedom as the ideology of the empire. This earned him plenty of ridicule on the sub, but for the first time, some saw his move as the caring move it was, and began to support him. The Mughals, unfortunately, lacked the resources to expand, and this decision all but ensured they would never become a power, but Akbar know that it was more important to take care of his people, then to entertain others, and when the time came, and the sky darkened with Finns and Vodka, Akbar knew he had done the right thing.</p><p></p><p>Even though Akbar died some time ago, his influence carried on. The first nation to understand the true genius of Akbar was Tibet, who were influenced by their neighbors decision and adopted freedom for themselves. Under Tibet, what was originally Akbar’s dream became known by those across the cylinder, and many consider him the father of eastern freedom. The greatest symbol of eastern freedom is the Statue of Liberty, which serves as a beacon and hope to thousands across the occupied world, leading to increased production. Even the Great Padro himself, not a champion of freedom by any means, respected the power of the Statue of Liberty.</p><p></p><p>And so, by deciding to look after his people instead of pleasing the great masters, Akbar inadvertently managed to do both, as well as create a lasting legacy across the cylinder of self care and Freedom. We should all learn this lesson from Akbar, take care of yourself before helping others.” - RanseStoddard</p>"

While all the other 3 Scandi nations made it to top 15, you... chose a different path. In your early war with Sweden, you chose to fight with an army of just 2 settlers, effectively gifting your neighbour a free city. From then on, you earned your nickname of Snoreway, staying quietly irrelevant for years, throwing a few armies at Nazi Germany when it suited you, but never gaining anything noteworthy as a result. In the end, Germany fell to your old enemy Sweden, giving the Lion of the North the edge when your old feud eventually restarted, resulting in you handing over all but two cities to Sweden in the peace deal before returning to an uncomfortable sleep. </p><p></p><p>Centuries later, you chose to follow the path of Freedom, and Sweden was happy to take that as the cue to quickly finish you off. Looking back on it now, I wonder, was this... a deliberate plan? Did you realise that Scandinavia was too crowded for any of you to succeed? Did you fall on your own sword to help boost Sweden to power, enabling the incredibly strong Scandinavian finish that we saw? Everything you did ended up helping your 'enemy', from weakening the Nazis, to all the gifts of free cities, even choosing Freedom to make the world hate you and reduce Sweden's warmongering penalty...

Their inclusion in the game is so distant a memory that it’s tempting to lump them in with those they died alongside, but besides the Sioux, no other early victim ever commanded such a large empire.

But this early on, one civ can never take on five, and a coalition of Australia, Hawaii, Champa, Indonesia and Japan was always set to triumph. When Champa navies strolled into Manila, they did the Philippines an even greater injustice than the third elimination of the game; the first TOTAL elimination, with no straggling units surviving into the far future, as with Rome and Ashanti.

Even after the Nazi’s declared an early war, Poland stood strong and managed to stabilize much of eastern Europe. Casimir was not insane though, he knew that his empire’s starting location was a recipe for disaster, so he made sure to allow all of his units time to enjoy the world around them, instead of hurrying them to their likely death. This policy resulted in one of the most infamous incidents on the cylinder, the Polish Scout standing immobile, smelling the flowers, blocking the entire Spartan army on their way to conquer Cuame. Who knows what the cylinder would look like now if Sparta had had the opportunity to take Cumae. Leonidas was enraged by the events, but Casimir himself is reported to have smiled when he learned that his units were taking his advice and smelling the flowers. Across the cylinder, the fame of the polish scout spread, and soon the scout was more than a symbol for taking time for yourself, but a symbol of peace, and the power of one man against an army. Other nations devoted themselves to the cult of the scout, most notably Hawaii, whose international peacekeepers were all required to learn the story of the scout. </p><p></p><p>In the end though, Casimir's fears proved correct. Despite creating a dominate eastern European empire, Poland was one of the first 5 civs eliminated. Despite their untimely deaths, the legacy of Poland survived through numerous peace keeping missions sent out across the cylinder. Casimir would be proud to know that his philosophy of not fighting the inevitable, and taking time to smell the roses long outlasted his time on the cylinder, and it is a philosophy we all would do well to implement in our lives.” - RanseStoddard</p>"

The most infamous move of all was ceding Braga to the Kongo despite the Kongo posing no military threat.

In their height, they held territory in the middle east, Europe and even some in Africa.

And in Africa, the metallic menace was springing to life. With all these powers showing their strength and crushing weaker civs, Sparta looked less and less impressive. The technology gap between them and the Boers was massive and despite the reputation, they didn’t have much of an army at all. They lost a fair number of cities through campaigns against the Boers and Armenians. Everyone just sort of assumed they had lost their touch. A product of the time.

Well, No. In fact, after their first engagement of taking out the Sioux, they were crushed by a Mexican army that took their capital and most of their land. Texas never really recovered from this but they got to the end through pure survival skills. Sam Houston was such a military genius that he connived a Mexican army that took his capital to just give it back and leave. After Canada started eying the weakened Texas, Houston marched on a revitalized America to grab some buffer zone territory. When the Inuit wave came devouring Canada and marching through texan lands, taking city after city, the capital of Austin stood as a bright star in the sea of Ice Blue. Even when Mexico went to crush this cockroach once and for all by taking Austin for like the ninth time, Houston stole a Mexican city and made it the new capital, the only city they would control for the rest of the game. Texas just wouldn’t die! They would watch as their old foe Mexico fell at the hands of the Blackfoot. Laughing as they lived in a Mexican city on a continent with two global powers. Texas was still inexplicably, alive. After wars with Mexico, Canada and the Inuit, they would eventually fall to the carnival. Brazil would take the city of Laredo in part 90.

But looking back on this civ's last moments, let us not forget that this forgotten tale of a few cities in the desert was still beloved by someone.

Arguably holding the title of such, Timur managed to be a good deal less bombastic than he did in real life, despite a start close to the densely packed Middle East, a reputation as an aggressive civ, and people like Attila and Kuchum as neighbors. He landed with both feet on the ground, owning a fairly sized empire in the early game. But he evidently forgot to run - early wars against Afghanistan and Armenia poked holes in his status as a dreaded civ to face, and before long he was in midfield, an afterthought who was easily passed by anyone with a pulse. Still, even by the fifteenth part, things looked promising - they still were a steppe civ, still had lots of land to work with, and, again, were within spitting distance of the turbulent Middle East. Perhaps he should have been higher - one pounce on a dying empire, and he'd almost certainly regain his upper-middle class status, with all the favorable housing, comfort, and respect it would entail.</p><p></p><p>So Timur wisely decided to forward settle Sibir, the largest civ he could find. Presumably, he thought a land of snow and ice was easily cowed. He was wrong. The war lasted all of four parts, and Timur never quite rebounded from his utter thrashing at the hands of the future King of Khans. From there, the pretender to the raddest throne out there became a chew toy for other, stronger civs, and we all collectively spent one part wondering what might've been before moving on to more exciting things, such as the simultaneous collapse of Poland and Germany. In retrospect, he played how we expected him to - used his geographical safety to core up until the medieval era, then declare war on every nation within spitting distance. It's just he was so terribly incompetent at it that he managed to achieve and do so very little, and to this day the only people who keep him in their minds are historically minded Sibir fans and prolific readers of the Lazy Portugal Show. Timur could've ruled the world. But instead, he ruled nobody and died a dishonorable vandal, and not the Rome-sacking kind. Ironic. He could save others from irrelevancy, but not himself.” - EndlessVoid0</p><p></p><p>Lunar Note: These were provided at the exact same time and inputted by Lime and myself; so both are here.

Provided there’s no issue, we can see the new iteration of the Battle Royale begin to turn, and shortly after it launches, we’ll begin to vote for the next season so we can keep the Battle Royales turning without end. This is our passion, and from every heart at Blue Cassette, we thank you for the memories, the memes, and the memoirs. </p><p></p><p>We also thank Burgerkrieg and Dawkinzz for providing a voice to the narration from the beginning to the end, and we can insure you that we can hear more beautifully rolled syllables for the many royales to come. We also thank the lovely map creators, who helped forge a unique identity and help us understand the world around us that more. We also thank TPangolin on starting this game and giving birth to such an amazing community. And finally we thank you for making the final part one of the most upvoted threads in a very long time. </p><p></p><p>See you at the coming dawn, everyone. See you for Civilizations Battle Royale X Season 1; coming soon.</p><p></p><p>Coiot's Note: Wednesday the 20th</p>"
