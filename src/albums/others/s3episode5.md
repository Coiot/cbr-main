    narration: "<p>Welcome and greetings to all you guys, gals, and nonbinary pals, it is I, Orange (aka u/Orangechrisy aka that weird depressed girl who makes the civball comics)! I’m back again with Episode 5, just like I was with MkX2 and MkX1, keeping this useless streak alive for some reason. Anyways I love the CBR too much and am so glad it’s still going on and that I can contribute more to it. I’ve finally bribed, uh I mean applied my way into being a Power Ranker! Maybe next time I narrate I’ll have infiltrated, ack um… “joined”, yeah, I’ll have joined the dev team despite my lack of skills.</p><p></p><p>So prepare yourselves once more for my terrible humor and a look into the stream of fuckery that is my thoughts. Oh and sorry in advance for how much I wrote, but I do hope you read it all. With that, let’s begin!</p>"

    narration: "<p>The lad whose name is three letters is bringing us through all the letters to take a look at every civ. This week u/E_C_H gives us the low down on the Anglo-Dutch. William III is an interesting character and some family drama leading to a Dutchman taking over England in the Glorious Revolution is quite the story. Though his performance in the game is not quite as “glorious”.</p>"

I’m being informed that neither civ has units on the front or really capable of doing anything. Seems Willy III lives another day.</p>"

Mali has finally gotten off their butt and produced some settlers, one founding Krina on the Niger and one heading up the coast towards Mauritania. Will Tetuoan follow suit? Eh, probably not.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we see the remains of the Mori settler, now but a slave to the Ainu. In their last moments as free men they penned a letter that was sent back home to Yoshida-Koriyama. It read: </p><p>Fade in, fade out</p><p>This crazy dream</p><p>Without a direction, floating aimlessly</p><p>There's nothing left</p><p>Back there for us</p><p>Breathe in, but it won't stop the rain from pouring</p><p>- Your Loyal Servants</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the letter Motonari held a period of mourning and made the letter a national artifact. He also called on Shakushain to end the hostilities between them. Sadly it was too late for the settlers, as they had already been sent to work in Ainu’s new city of Shiraoi.</p>"

But either way Kamehameha I has left Hawaii to join Isabella in her failed campaign against the Anglo-Dutch. He reported back to the queen “Their defense is over 9000 15!” and she immediately sent William III a request for peace while quaking in fear. And she was so close to taking the city as well.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The more important notification from last slide was the Permians allowing Massagetae to make peace, at the cost of Oxus. This is gonna be a devastating blow to Tomyris’ ambitions and further solidifies the Permians’ dominance of Central Asia.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We catch a look at Pandya’s defense of their southern half of the subcontinent. Things are currently looking fine for them but it could quickly go badly. Rani is quickly building up her Maraval’s. They gain an extra attack before their melee attack when on the coast, so Tirunelveli can be fairly easily defended with enough Maravals. </p><p></p><p>Also in the north we see another settler out for Bengal who continues to build up quite the empire.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Shifting a bit east is a Philippine settler preparing to surround Cambodia with a settle near irl Bangkok. Kokang is also seeking to settle a bit to the north. Sihanouk is reported to have sent letters to Yang and Aguinaldo saying “Pls no hurt :(“. Emilio Aguinaldo returned the letter with one of his own stating “No.”, while Olive Yang used the letter to smoke opium with. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode5-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>So from a quick google it seems Corenlius Smelt was a British general during the American Civil War, and then a governor of the Isle of Mann. His historical career seems just as interesting as the war between Brazil and Argentina. The two civs have some slight squabbling but it looks like the Inca may take over the war. Maybe Tupac will spit enough fire to burn the jungle down and give him easy access to the Brazilian cities. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Angola and Chad make peace to allow for Chad to turn around and attack Egypt along with the Normans. Idriss Deby posted to Claytabletgram a meme showing himself as the chad and Aten as the soyjak. Akhenaten soon responded with multiple posts saying “ATEN IS THE CHADDEST, ALL THOSE WHO REFUSE HIS LIGHT ARE THE SOYJAKS”. One of his advisors was seen keeping people away from his chief’s quarters. </p><p></p><p>Angola also sends a settler along Chad’s borders and perhaps seeks to surround Chad in the east.</p>"

    narration: "<p>A closer look at the Norman-Egypt front we can see Egypt really lacking in a western army. The Normans boast a respectable army and navy, but will it be able to take Thebes? I don’t know there’s like 60 more slides and I don’t look ahead.</p><p></p><p>Akhenaten continues to furiously post about how only Aten deserves to rule the Mediterranean. Robert Guiscard just questions how the sun in the sky is going to rule the sea.</p>"

We feel a bit sorry for Qocho, forced into only one city. Two fellow settlers, one Han and one Ming, are seeking to surround them further. Hopefully they may have some respite in these violent times.</p><p></p><p>We continue our trek west. The promised land is still out of our reach. Perhaps we will find it in the Gobi.

    narration: "<p>Azykay halts the raising of Oxus, keeping their city in the middle of Massagetae. It really is just devastating and I doubt Massagetae will be able to come back from this. Makes my ranking of them lower feel good (though I really should have had them much lower from the start). At least they were able to keep Khazaria’s somewhat retreating army at bay, for whatever that’s worth.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode5-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>My bois look at them they are doing so well I am so proud. </p><p></p><p>They settle another city on the Mexican coast and build the Gate of the Sun which grants +3 food and +1 gold on lake tiles, +15% growth in all cities. Not entirely sure if that lake bonus is for all cities as well though (Coiot pls make a note on this slide for that thank). But ah, I’ve been absolutely adoring Mohave’s performance this run, and I see them going far. Basically all of Mexico to themselves because of Comanche and Central America’s lack of settling. And they didn’t send their first settler to the other side of the world (they waited for their third settler to do that, keeping their fun absurdity). Basically I simp hard for west coast civs (you should too) and Mohave are fulfilling all of my expectations and more.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Now what others may consider more important, but I don’t know why it would be more important than seeing Mohave doing good, it’s Muisca’s declaration of war against Kayapo. Muisca doesn’t have that big of an army and Kayapo is absolutely surrounded by jungle so it’s not looking good for them. But on the other hand, Kayapo has no military and no production. If Muisca focuses on Bau then they can probably take the city, but I don’t see them being able to take Gorotire with that army. If they manage to somehow take it though it will set them as the premier power in South America.</p>"

I hope. Well, I don’t hope that much since I like Egypt more than Turkey but like you know what I mean.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Vsevolod watches over Sarkel from his big chair that was brought over to the outskirts of the city. He’s proud of his conquest, as he should be. As he watches he commands his men to go after Balanjar as he heard about a nice big chair location in the city. Khazaria has barely any units back for defense which means this is their demise. </p>"

    scene_title: "Gate of the Mohave"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode5-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>We get a nice little zoom in on Mohave’s capital where they built the Gate of the Sun. The lake bonus won’t be too helpful here, but if it is for all cities then they have a number of locations elsewhere that will benefit from it. But more importantly they get that sweet sweet +15% growth in all cities. I’m also not sure if that is actually +15% growth is actually growth or if it’s food like the Temple of Artemis which also says growth. Difference being that the percent food is based on the total food while the percent growth is only based on the excess food after the population has consumed their food. Hopefully it’s the first. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Gokturks expand out into Siberia with Nevkat and another settler about to settle a bit further away. A nice growth of two cities will as they currently lag behind their two neighbors that aren’t major fuckups in like every stat besides military (and they really aren’t putting their military to use). Perhaps this will signal good things in the future but for now it’s just them playing a bit of catch up.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Uganda-Kilwa war is still ongoing for some reason but it finally creates some action as Uganda decides to do the stupid move of settiling a city on the Somalian coast, right next to the naval civ that they are fighting. A bold strategy that is likely to result in further gains for Kilwa, which I mean hey, if you support Kilwa this is fantastic news. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season3-episode5-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>Okay the title is a bit of a stretch but Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan is the channel Andrew Callaghan created after his old channel got more or less taken from him which was called All Gas No Breaks. I thought of that because Qocho just can’t catch a break with all these wars. Sungulug Khagan just wakes up, finds another war declaration that was sent to him, and goes back to sleep wanting to ignore it. Though in this case Tuva has a rather large army that will likely do more than Han so I doubt he will be able to get the sleep he so desires.</p><p></p><p>Also Ming found their outpost in the Gobi Desert, this is surely a good idea to have a super cut off city that can only benefit them.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Vsevolod sets up his big chair once again, this time around Balanjar, in order to watch the siege unfold. His army is quickly battering down the city’s walls and it doesn’t look like anything can stop him here. I still think they need to found some more cities before being considered to be in a good position but it’s far better than it used to be already.</p>"

Though he has relinquished his duties in Japan after two grueling wars and seeing Mori fail to settle their island, and decided he really needed a vacation in Brazil.

Hans Egede has decided to do a sneak attack on Vermont while their army is fighting America. Only he forgot to put his units in position to do a sneak attack. But maybe with all those fleets in the vague vicinity will be able to take Montpelier. </p>"

Meanwhile Tetuoan continues to do nothing with a bit of nothing to go along with it.

    narration: "<p>Hold that thought as it seems Tetuoan did in fact settle a third city! Only it’s in Iberia. But to be fair, Castile did somehow mess up their Anglo-Dutch war and don’t have much of an army right now so they are pretty safe. Though the Normans also found Capua right near Tetuoan’s capital in return.</p>"

They also have another settler just east of Ribe that may settle Gotland or perhaps Lappland. Frederick-William I goes over to Cottbus with a large megaphone and shouts “That’s what you get for forward settling me you scum!”. Canute doesn’t hear it as he is busy sleeping after a heavy night of drinking his problems away even though drinking can’t stop the fact that they won’t build more settlers. </p>"

Some say he just wanted a beach mansion for himself. Some even say it’s an elaborate plan that uses the claiming of far away lands as a method to better consolidate the lands in between. Others just take it as what it is, a weird tropical city. </p>"

Afghanistan founds Peshawar around irl Hyderabad while Bengal’s settler heads into SouthEast Asia. Alli Rani has a lot of units back at her capital which she really needs to bring to the war front.

    narration: "<p>Quanah looks at the approaching American ship. Will it be their savior? Or will it be their end? He ponders these questions as he thinks about the orders from Iron Jacket. Sent on a journey across the continent, into boats to cross the northern Atlantic, down the coasts to Iberia, and then the order to come back. It didn’t make sense to him. Long ago his next in line, Mupitsukupu, suggested that perhaps Iron Jacket had a vendetta against them. Quanah had initially balked at the notion and dismissed it, seeing the trek as a spiritual mission, but as time went on he became more weary. Seeing the American ship approaching he wondered if maybe Mupitsukupu was right after all. Time moved forward.</p><p></p><p>The ship decreased their distance and Quanah called for his fellow journeymen to raise the flag of mercy. It was quickly raised. They shouted for help to the approaching ship, hoping their fears wouldn’t come true. The ship increased speed. Time moved forward.</p><p></p><p>The American ship grew closer. Time moved forward.</p><p></p><p>Quanah and his journeyman’s voices began to strain and falter. Time moved forward.</p><p></p><p>The American ship was close enough for Quanah to see the American sailors on the bow, close enough for him to see their eyes full of anger. He prayed to the Great Spirit that perhaps it would allow them a merciful judgment in the afterlife. Time moved forward.</p><p></p><p>The crunch of wood sounded out like a crack of lightning as the American ship rammed straight into the side of the Comanche journeymen’s boat. The Great Spirit would be more merciful than the Americans, providing a quick end, but the path to the afterlife would be wet, painful, and splintered. Time didn’t move forward for some.</p>"

But this time they will be losing it to the originally ranked 61st civ. On a brighter note for Cambodia, the Philippine settler has turned away from central Thailand and heads down the Malay peninsula, allowing Cambodia a slight bit more room. For now.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Eight slides ago I was reminded that Brandenburg is at war with the Anglo-Dutch since their turn quick look thing in the top left showed up. I totally forgot about this war cause Frederick-William I was doing jack shit to fight. But it seems they have woken up a bit from their settling spree to go send an army to The Hague. However they seemed to forget that they don’t have a navy since they have forced some of their land units to embark and attack from the sea. Time will tell if this strategy will work or if Frederick-William I - Frederick + 2 will somehow survive once more.

(Pretty sure it’s going to Brazil since I didn’t see them make peace but I think it’ll just immediately get destroyed by the unit in the city. Didn’t know you could send caravans on paths that go through cities you are at war with.)</p>"

Chad on the other hand brings Gempaaten down to red with melee units around but difficult terrain to get through. They’ve also split some units to go attack Akhetaten, and Egyptian units are beginning to help fight. By the way, Egypt’s unit is the Khopesh which gains +25% damage towards injured units and +50% if within two tiles of an obelisk (their UI).
