  narration: "<p>Here is a spicy Mancui declaration: Japan goes to war against their religious adversaries. Looks to be rather foolish as Khanbaliq has yet to fully recover, and the Manchu will welcome not having to go all the way around Kaiping to send units to Ganzhou.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Vietnam is about to break into Ganzhou, but no celebrations just yet as Bhutan senses a chance and declares on them. Hai Phòng looks like an achievable target, despite the presence of many Fort improvements by Vietnam. Also on-screen is the new Somali settlement of Jowhaar. Somalia is keeping their game alive by boldly settling out of Africa.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Khanbaliq now belongs to Nurhaci! Japan looks to retaliate, but the Manchu horde looks far too strong for them. Elsewhere, Girn is besieged by Perm’s navy after mopping up the meager Manchu defenses up north.

  narration: "<p>Yuan finally falls with the Manchu capture of Ganzhou. It looked even for a little bit, but ultimately having to fight on all sides was far too much for Yuan. The Manchu look ascendant; Japan’s flip of Khanbaliq is calmly brushed aside.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>On the western side of the Urals, we find that Perm has quite the long highway connecting most of their cities. Impressive to see such a long road, doubly so since it means Perm can easily move units quickly from their safe core into either Europe or the Near East. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The New Netherlands expedition is mostly wiped out, but there are still Permian troops nearby. I would like to point out that the Manchu settler will be captured and converted into a worker next turn. Despite having acres of free space, Manchu wants to try to settle more of the Arctic. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Again on this screen I would like to point out a settler capture. The now Peru-Bolivian worker on the front lines was a rather optimistic hope of a forward base for Gran Colombia, but surely a sign of relief for the already boxed in Peru-Bolivia. We also spy that legendary Henry Morgan has joined the fight. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Teutons begin to fight on two opposite fronts as Perm not only are ready they even built the well positioned city of Vychegda between two bodies of water. It looks like a good defensible terrain, but having no troops in the face of the majority of the Teuton army does not bode well. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Well this is a sad sight. Not surprising, but surely disappointing. Despite the fight looking even, Peru-Bolivia has opted to give away one of their only three cities in a massively disadvantageous peace deal. Peru-Bolivia’s chances in this game are over. Andrés de Santa Cruz really was in an inside job. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Somalia enters a Dark Age. War on multiple fronts, a growing population before EE, and probably not enough luxuries all contribute to a sad state of affairs. On the bright side, Somalia claims Madagascar before Namibia ever gave it a thought. More cities is always a good long-term prospect.</p>"
