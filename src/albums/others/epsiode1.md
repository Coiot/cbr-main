    narration: "<p>Welcome back everyone, I’m happy to introduce CBRX Season 3. We were not quite able to achieve the seamless transitions between seasons as we did with the previous two cycles, but a four month gap is still a record (and in truth the recording itself was much less). At the moment the game still does not have a winner, but it is beyond T700 and the roster is looking rather slim. Thanks to much hard work, we’ve ensured that this time around there are no embarrassing bugs hidden about and thanks to a few modifications, we are seeing no overflowing peacekeepers whatsoever so there is a likely chance we’ll have the full map in one color without resetting the game. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The newly expanded PR team has been hard at work the days preceding this episode and when the dust settled, Rio dela Plata is the competitor tipped to perform the best this season. Now it is of course far to early for certainty, but you have several civs in the top ten spots that occupy your usual geographically favored locations. Time will tell which meet expectations, which will flop, and which will make you smile far into the future. </p>"

    narration: "<p>On to the show proper, we begin as usual on the leftmost side of the map with Ireland, the Anglo-Dutch, the Anglo-Norse, and Brandenburg. The sparsely populated isles are contrasted with the immediately bunched up group of competitors on the continent. Brandenburg starts the game already being a fan favorite, whilst the other three feel the weight of that forecast with downcast initial ranks. </p>"

If you’re looking for competitors with high potential, I would pick one of these two to go the distance. Qocho on the other hand has a different outlook.

    narration: "<p>The Arapaho chose the Pantheon belief of *checks notes* Nationalism Animals?? Well what seems to have occurred is that the SQL command for adding the Spirit ideology looks for the word Spirit and replaces it with Nationalism when certain RtP modules are active so this belief’s text was caught up in that. But it is nice to think that the Arapaho have instead proclaimed that all animals in their domain are state property instead.  </p>"

The Arapaho have seized more bison as part of the collectized inventory as the Cree look to expand southwards. We’ll catch everyone back here on CBR.tv next week. This episode was a bit lengthier than what we should expect moving forward given the initial intros, so expect faster reads this season.
