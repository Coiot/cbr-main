Things begin to heat up now that the map is getting filled up.</p><p></p><p>Like in C2, we’ll begin by looking at the Governments first so you know what state the competitors are in throughout the episode. A few changes around as V.O.C. changes to a Tribal Confederacy as each of their islands seek some form of autonomy, and the Ptolemeis rally around Dictator Cleopatra while holding the Suez line. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Muism is well set for a good military advantage over their Yuan neighbors with Just War if they keep spreading to their cities. Ramadan might not be good early on, but they could be a Culture juggernaut with that and Arboreal Communion. Lutheranism looks built for spreading far and fast, which is not what Namibia seems to be doing with it so far. Televangelism might not be getting yields from Broadcast Towers for some time, but the spread bonus begins right away. </p>"

What Perm will do with so much Faith remains to be seen, but maybe we’ll see Missionary and Inquisitor spam later on.Calvinism has a well-rounded set of beliefs. Bit of a grab bag, but seeing Mandatory Tribute, knowing their capital also has the Hanging Gardens, then I can now see why the city is so huge and New Netherlands leading in total Food.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Forgot to include the map the previous time, but here is the current religious spread. Most impressive to note is Vajrayana, which is present as far as Africa from their base in India. Best not to confuse them with SHinto, which is almost the same red hue as them, and has made landfall in North America.  </p>"

Shoutout to Japan for being so densely packed and Wales leading the way in literacy. That is all for now. Hope you enjoy the show. Let me know in the comments if this pace is good or if you would prefer slightly less or more slides per album. I’m recording this slowly in my spare time, so I can adjust freely based on your feedback. </p>"
