  scene_title: "Taking Flight"

  narration: "<p>Salutations! Welcome back to the Trajan Royale, the only game of Civ where the winner is already predetermined. But which Trajan will take the prize? Last time we saw impressive performances from Capital Rome, Upper Rome and Old Rome, and less impressive performances from Far Rome and Neo-Rome, both on death’s door. But it’s still very much all to play for. Let’s see which Romes can unite the Mare Nostrum, and which delenda est.</p><p></p><p>Free Rome, with their advanced navy, are looking to bolster their land forces with the help of Gaius Marius. A key figure in the Republic’s politics and armies, he emerged victorious against both a Celtic/Germanic alliance and the Numidians, while helping craft the Roman Army into a professional outfit rather than a combination of various levies. He also enshrined the aquila (eagle) as the standard of the Roman Empire! No Celts or Numidians to fight here though - only other Romans. We’ll see how he fares soon, I’m sure.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Explosive Rome seems to be discontent with some distant colonists settling on their backdoor, and are sending a healthy contingent towards the Old Roman city of Qart Hadasht. They’re led by a fellow with a fitting name, but Roman isn’t actually a Roman of course - he’s a rather brutal warlord who fought against the Soviets from his base in Mongolia, where he acquired the sobriquet of the Mad Baron. He certainly has a beefy enough army here to inflict pain, but as far as I know war hasn’t even been officially declared yet, so we’ll see. Meanwhile Capital Rome has backed off a little on the last vestige of Far Rome. A little rebuild is probably in order - as successful as the war has been, it’s taken a little out of them.</p>"

  scene_title: "Mountains Beyond Mountains"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>Instead, it’s Neo-Rome who looks like they’ll be first to be eliminated, as Upper Rome assaults their capital with enough melee units to likely see it out. Like Capital Rome they look a bit spent - but it might be a much bigger problem for them, if that army north of Golden Rome is anything to go by. The Alps are a formidable barrier though; I think they’ll be safe for the time being. And again, no war officially declared yet. Responsible for defending the homeland is Lady K’abel, a Mayan queen also known as Lady Water Lily Hand or, incredibly, Lady Snake Lord.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sultan of Oman etc"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>The closely fought war between Punished Rome and Shiny Rome comes to an end, and in the end the two sides couldn’t be divided. Both appear to have emerged stronger, in fact - the military production for both sides outstripping their losses. This is sure to be a tense subcontinent for some time to come. The other nearby power, Old Rome, builds a new wonder too, Stone Town. That’s the old city on the Isle of Zanzibar, and will give them a couple of trade routes among other monetary bonuses.</p>"

  scene_title: "Does Hippo Regius Mean Horse King?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chad Rome has been thoroughly settling the Numidian coast, with their latest city Saguntum being settled close to the modern city of Melilla, a Spanish exclave in Morocco known as Rusadir to the Romans. When we last left them they’d been at war with Just Rome to the south, but it seems that war’s petered out, as the bulk of their army is now located ominously just west of their territory, possibly aimed towards the mysterious Forgotten Rome. Meanwhile their transmediterranean colony of Hippo Regius is unprotected, but currently uncontested, with no foreign armies nearby. An invasion by nearby Broken Rome would almost certainly wind up a tit-for-tat exchange with their colony in Morocco, visible in the minimap.</p>"

  scene_title: "Isle of Copper"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shiny Rome settles Lilybaeum on Cyprus, which was known to the Romans as… Cyprus. Well, that’s anti-climactic. Of more drama is the invasion of Far Rome’s last city, Hispalis, by the Capital Romans. The pikes and bowmen might not be enough, but we can see Capital Trajan boasts newly built musketmen and crossbowmen behind the lines. Meanwhile at the top of the screen, South Rome is sending an army, well, south - finally looking to invade their rightful homelands, perhaps. A more noteworthy news story appears in the sidebar...</p>"

  scene_title: "Mr. Anderson Wins This Time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>As predicted, Neo-Rome will ironically become a thing of history books as they are the first to be eliminated, with Upper Rome waltzing into Palmyra. Neo-Rome had a pretty unlucky time of it - invaded by both of their immediate neighbours, they briefly managed to turn the tide against their aggressors but were ultimately overwhelmed. Not an embarrassing performance by any means, but style alone won’t win you a game. Upper Rome looks pretty strong now, but an elimination will definitely make them a target for other nearby civs - although Golden Rome’s army still can’t figure out a route through the Alps, it seems.</p>"

  scene_title: "Tagus Divides Us"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>All is quiet in Iberia. These two states were at war fairly recently, though neither’s force looks large enough to initiate a new invasion. There’s a lot of land here still to be settled, with Free Rome focusing on the north coast and Broken Rome focusing on… uh… other things, it seems. It might well be Chad Rome who snaps up this land, though no settlers here so far.</p>"
- scene_number: 09
  scene_title: "Punishing the"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Eminent Rome have dodged the cameras in this game, which isn’t surprising given how far away they started from most of the other Romes - they’ve not had much chance to interact with their competitors. That might change soon, as Punished Rome settles Fregellae right on their doorstep - and even with their outdated army of spearmen, this would be a decently simple taste of blood for the Eminent Romans. They do have a couple of wounded units, so perhaps they’re already at war.</p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "How’d You"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well Forgotten Rome has little to worry about from Chad Rome, as they’re not the targets of their anger - they can keep on building the Sistine Chapel, as our spy informs us. Instead, Chad Rome has declared war on Broken Rome, which isn’t a huge shock - Sena Gallica is a sitting duck. But remember, so is Hippo Regius, Chad Rome’s colony in Spain; as I mentioned before it wouldn’t surprise me if they merely traded one colony for the other here. Sena Gallica is settled close to the real Roman city of Lixus, now known as Larache in Morocco, which is known in mythology as the home of the Garden of the Hesperides.</p>"

  scene_title: "It’ll Be More than a Month in the Country"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hispalis is surely doomed. Not a great sign when your main defenders are artists and writers, like Turgenev here. All is not necessarily lost for Far Rome though - a settler floats just outside Palmyra, which could theoretically find an escape route for the beleaguered Romans. It’s unlikely though - I think Shiny Rome is still at war with them, and they have a trireme within spitting distance. Meanwhile South Rome and Explosive Rome both continue to send their armies into foreign lands. In fact, it sort of looks like they’re both looking for each other. Time will tell where their eventual target is.</p>"

  scene_title: "I Found Them"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lost Rome has been quietly strengthening since the start of the game, keeping out of everyone’s way. That changes now, as they send an advanced army on the relatively unprotected colonies of Just Rome. This is modern day Tunisia, known to the Romans simply as Africa. The coastline looks lovely and lifelike, almost nice enough to distract from the rather less pretty rendition of Sicily in the top right.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Sayonara Sena Gallica"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chad Rome conquers Sena Gallica, but in a rather un-chad move immediately burns it to the ground. I suppose they figured it would be fairly undefendable if Forgotten Rome came knocking, which may be true but… you know… why invade, then? The good news for them is that Broken Rome has made no attempts to march on Hippo Regius as of yet. Maybe they don’t know it’s there.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "The Crouching Dragon"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Zhuge Liang. In China, his name is as respected as Sun Tzu, a masterful Classical leader and strategist. I mean look at this - he’s managing to win a battle that he’s not even at! Yes, as expected, Lost Rome is making short work of Castrum Novum, which is built near the real Roman city of Sicca Veneria, or El Kef today. Castrum Novum just means New Castle, though. Well, it’s certainly about to see new ownership.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Too Sad to Tell You"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh Jupiter! That wasn’t meant to happen! Far Rome does indeed fall, but not to the city that’s put all the pain in - instead it goes to Explosive Rome, who appear to have captured it with a stray pikeman that last time we saw this area was floating absentmindedly in the middle of the Med. Unfortunately this impressive conquest will soon be forgotten by the historians as Hispalis is also being razed to the ground. This almost seems like more of a FU to Capital Rome than Far Rome, to be honest. In any case Far Rome’s spare settler has been destroyed, so they too are eliminated. They didn’t have quite as plucky a showing as Neo-Rome, never really getting their feet off the ground before Capital Rome decimated them. Now they’re reduced to Turgenev and the artist Bas Jan Ader, a very bizarre Dutch conceptual artist, who unfortunately drowned quite early into his career. Very fascinating guy.</p><p></p><p>In other news, Shiny Rome to the north beat Forgotten Rome to the Sistine Chapel. Better luck next time.</p>"

  scene_title: "Reverse Albigensian Crusade"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Resident wonder-whore West Rome has been a bit invisible this game, again thanks to a rather isolated position and not much desire to expand out of it. They founded Anglicanism last episode, but haven’t found much of a desire to expand that either, unlike Upper Rome who’s sent Cathar missionaries to convert the heathens. How the tables turn, eh?</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Burning Buffalo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lost Rome sweeps into Castrum Novum and, as is the theme of the episode so far, sets it alight. The army’s next target is surely Sirmium, as the core city of Satricula seems a fair bit better garrisoned. I’m not immediately sure what that wonder Supreme Rome has built is - it must come from JFD’s Rise to Power mod, but I don’t see a mention of it on the Wikia. My guess from the image is that it’s the Selimiye Mosque of Edirne, but there’s a few others it could be.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Extinguishing Flames"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ooh, I wasn’t expecting this. Chad Rome’s just showing off now, starting a naval assault of the Broken Roman capital of Tyrus. Without a dedicated amphibious assault I’m not sure it’ll be enough to take the city, but never say never. Broken Rome certainly doesn’t seem too concerned, taking this opportunity to finish work on the Grand Canal. Does that refer to the Chinese one or the Venetian one? The answer is yes. In-game it doesn’t do a huge deal, giving a healthy gold boost for trade routes in and out of the city. Of more note is that Sena Gallica is no longer being razed. We’re using a mod that means AIs can actually stop razing cities if their happiness becomes a net positive, and that’s what’s happened here.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Even Further Rome"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Er… sike, I guess. Far Rome is back. I really thought that settler had been killed, but turns out it was just waiting offscreen, ready to continue its nation’s legacy. And this new glimmer of hope was immediately overshadowed by war declarations from left right and centre, most notably from Capital Rome, South Rome and Punished Rome, all of hom border the Republic of Zama Regia. But I gotta say - given Far Rome’s only real strategy here is “hope we don’t die”, Zama Regia is a perfect settle, surrounded by mountains and just a tile away from the coast, creating a near-flawless bottleneck that’ll make actually taking the city a difficult feat indeed. Still, their lack of any military force whatsoever might make it a tad easier.</p>"

  scene_title: "One Fiery Lamp"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shiny Rome looks for new shiny landmasses to conquer, as they settle some of the Greek islands. They’ve been one of the more expansive nations, with another settling wandering into Phrygia, just south of Old Rome. Given how militarily strong all the nations in this region are, this is a wise strategy. Back near their capital we can see their newest general, Lampião. He was a brutal Brazilian bandit who’s since garnered a reputation as a folk hero, a little like Dick Turpin or Ned Kelly. At the moment there are no good wars to fight, and no legends to make. I’m sure it’ll change soon enough.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Crom-well-ulent Performance"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Two of the most arrogantly named civs go to war, as Eminent Rome invades neighbour Supreme Rome. On first glance they look to have a real advantage, but those Supreme pikemen should tear apart the antiquated spearmen that Eminent Rome is fielding. The colony of Fregellae just to the right would’ve been a much more manageable target, but that’s the AI for ya. Trust Oliver Cromwell to make questionable decisions.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Teurn Around Now"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Upper Rome faces the consequences of their belligerence as the powerful Golden Rome declares war. I was worried that any invasion would be staggered by the Alps, and indeed only a few troops have made it through the terrain so far. There should be plenty of time for Upper Rome to move their defenders from the huge city of Cremona to Teurnia. In the meantime Mr Walmart will be hoping to pay off any attackers that come near. Upper Rome has the first cannons I’ve spotted, too - that’s a great improvement over the trebuchet, but there are no cities to prove them on right now.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "No Gilgul for These Guys"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>All is quiet on the Alboran Sea, as Sena Gallica recovers and the assault on Tyrus peters out. Broken Rome has made no attempt on Hippo Regius, but then, they don’t really have any army to speak of - that’s a miserable contingent for this era, although it’s at least keeping up with advancements with the pikes and cannons. But Chad Rome has no desire to turn their advantage into further games, sending only a prophet into Iberia. That’s Isaac Luria, the father of contemporary Kabbalah, a type of Jewish mysticism that goes way over my head.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "African Union"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lost Rome completes the unification of Africa (the Roman province, not the continent), capturing Sirmium. They’re currently razing the city, but we can see they reversed their decision to raze Castrum Novum and may well do the same here. That’s if it’s not retaken - there are probably enough ships there to flip the city back once. A further invasion of Just Rome would see them up against their star general Abd al-Rahman. Abd III will be familiar to CBRX fans as the leader of the victorious Moors, but this is likely the first of his name, the first ruler of the Caliphate of Córdoba. In the top right, we see Golden Rome settle the malformed Sicily. </p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "You Lose Some"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well, this was always a possibility. Forgotten Rome remembers this is a domination match and declares war on Chad Rome, their whole army pointing towards their recent conquest of Sena Gallica. Yeah, that’s gonna be a massacre; Chad Trajan can only hope they don’t push further.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "You Think for Being Explosive They’d Have Researched Gunpowder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The other war declared this turn is a rather more even one, with Explosive War attempting another invasion of Lower Rome after their successful fake elimination of Far Rome (they did wind up keeping that city after all). They’ve even brought Sternberg back for the battle, though he’s holding tight in Velitrae for now. These two sides have a twisted kind of tech parity - Explosive Rome has the crossbows, but his pikes would be no match for Lower Rome’s muskets. The former has a decent sized invasion force, but unlike Lower Rome they’ve nothing in reserve - if that initial wave fails spectacularly, this could backfire horrible for the Exploding Emperor.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "The Hated Hermit"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yet another war is declared on Far Rome, this time by the not-too-far Old Rome. You want to know my theory why such an innocuous little nation is facing so many war declarations? It’s because this region has so many powerful civs this is the only city any of the nations stand a decent chance of taking. Punished Rome seems to be taking the initiative more than most, though even with their huge army it’ll be tough to round those mountains.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "It Has Some Amazing Stained Glass"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sena Gallica falls as expected, though Chad Rome should flip the city back next turn. Broken Rome is just happy to be out of the spotlight, giving Forgotten Rome some naval support and not much else. Free Rome is escorting a Great Musician to Catalonia, for some reason. There is a lovely opera house in Barcelona, I guess.</p>"

  scene_title: "Initials U.R."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Golden Romans look to have evaporated, with their forces dispersed across Provence. Upper Rome haven’t even moved their defence force, confident as they are that this invasion will peter out soon. Instead the armies are listening to wicked chansons of one Serge Gainsbourg, the French troubadour behind some of the most controversial and explicit French pop of the 20th century. </p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "All Quiet on the Northern Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>War finally comes to quiet North Rome. Not through their choice, of course - I fully believe left to their own devices they’d have stayed at peace the whole game. It’s Shiny Rome over the Aegean who declare war, along with Lost Rome who probably don’t pose a threat. In fact I’d say as it stands no threats are posed - Shiny Rome certainly has a bigger army, but not much of it is naval. Neither side has much of a fleet, and ultimately this is a battle that can only be fought on the waves. Though Shiny Rome may want to change that, sending a cursory settler into Thrace for potential future land incursions. Old Rome was invited to the war, but appears to have gotten the wrong memo, declaring war on far off Lower Rome instead.</p>"

  scene_title: "Still Stitched Up at Londonium and Londinium"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of Lower Rome, they’re doing a decent job at defending Nicopolis, which is down to yellow health but has enough support in place that the city should flip back if it’s captured. They’re also sending exploratory settlers out into Cyrenaica to the northwest. There’s a huge gap of virgin territory between Lower and Lost Rome, so good to see it being settled at last.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "How the Tables Teurn"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Scattered armies, you say? No, Golden Rome was just executing the perfect pincer movement, having evidently learnt their lessons from Cannae, a battle where Hannibal decimated Roman troops with this very tactic. Teurnia falls and is likely safe. Can Golden Rome push further? Luceria in particular looks very uncomfortable, though Cremona and Caesarea are probably secure for the time being.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nicopolis is briefly taken by Explosive Rome, but it doesn’t take Cassandra to see it won’t last long, the Lower Roman defence corps having fully mobilised. In the sidebar, Chad Rome sues for peace with Forgotten Rome, who had successfully gained the only thing they went to war for, Sena Gallia.</p>"

  scene_title: "No Winners in (This) War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Both armies here are absolutely spent, but even as Ostia falls to yellow I reckon Supreme Rome have done enough here to fight off Eminent Rome, the latter only having two melee units remaining on the battlefields. Still, this war’s done little more than stunt both nations - with both lagging significantly behind in tech and territory, this is a serious shot in the foot for both of them.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Self-Depreciation"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oof, Just Rome paid a hefty price for peace with Lost Rome, giving up their third city of Saticula in the treaty. This city was very unlikely to change hands through warfare, so it’s a messy sacrifice. For now Lost Rome’s burning the city, but we can see once again they’ve spared Sirmium at the last minute, so I suspect they’ll do the same once again. Both Saticula and the remains of Just Rome look very vulnerable to Chad Rome, who will surely want a positive war after their loss to Forgotten Rome.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hopefully Cleaner than the Name Implies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shiny Rome conjured up an armada from somewhere, and has seized Curia, though the battle for the island is likely still ongoing as the bulk of North Rome’s navy rushes to defend it. The fleet of frigates hanging outside Corfinium suggests there’s only way this war’s ending though - and given the remainder of North Rome’s cities are coastal too, there could be mortal danger on the line here. And Shiny Rome did manage to settle Thrace, with the rather unfortunately named Hippo Diarrhytus. Yuk. It’s placed on the site of the real Roman city of Aenus… oh God, I’m not making it better, am I? Meanwhile the Iberian nations make peace… wait, they were at war? Wow, neither side was making any effort in that conflict. Just as well it’s over.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ostia-perosis"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’ve not been the best at predictions these past few slides, and here’s yet another example: Ostia does fall to Eminent Rome, and there’s actually only a slim chance they’ll lose it again. While Supreme Rome does have a decent army to their name, it’s mostly ranged units, which can’t take back a city by themselves. Perhaps their new general Nurhaci can come up with a solution, though those watching the fellow lead the Manchu in CBRX2 will know that’s pretty unlikely - they were devoured in that game. Wanna learn more about CBRX? /r/civbattleroyale is the place to head to!</p>"

  narration: "<p>The two great armies of Gaul finally clash at Teurnia. Both sides look very even, though Upper Rome have the slightly harder job of assaulting their former city rather than defending it. Serge’s raunchy numbers rally the troops to the Upper Roman cause, but let’s hope this campaign doesn’t end up like Bonnie & Clyde for the chanteur.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Nicopolis is recaptured as expected, and while the city doesn’t look super safe, there’s only one Explosive Roman melee unit in range, and it’s nearly been finished-off already. Still, the war ain’t over til it’s over, and there still looks to be life in this conflict, with both nations fielding decent reserves. LoCuwer Rome settles Motya in Cyrenaica, their first coastal city. Already Explosive Roman galleasses scout out the new threat.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Since we last saw this area, Curia had flipped back to North Rome but is now back in the hands of Shiny Rome, who have also dispersed the last remnants of the North Roman navy. They complete their domination of the Aegean with a new city, Leptis Parva, and begin blockading both Neapolis and Verona. Still, unless they can commit to one of these cities, I’m not sure they have the firepower to finish off the Northerners once and for all. They do build the Alhambra though, a fairly handy wonder. To the south we see an Old Roman settler, seemingly a little damaged, I’m not sure by whom. I wonder what shores it’s headed to...</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/trajan-part2-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>The now-at-peace Iberia looks, unsurprisingly, incredibly similar to the at-war Iberia. Peacetime has at least allowed Broken Rome’s culture to flourish, birthing the musician James Brown, who should need no introduction! Forgotten Rome settles another city menacingly close to Chad Rome, Sulci. And see that just outside Sena Gallica? That’s a Neo-Roman trireme, long outlasting its parent nation. Hell, Neo-Rome only had a coastal city for about five turns, so this trireme has done well to stick around.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shiny Rome are the wonder-hoarders of the episode, claiming another to their name, the less useful Globe Theatre. Their core’s really solidified now, but so have Old Rome and Punished Rome’s - there’ll be no easy fights in Asia Minor. It seems to be a bit of a golden age for music right now, with Oliphant joining the Shiny ranks.

North of that, Shiny Rome also settles Lixus, on the site of the real Roman city of Heraclea Sintica in modern Bulgaria. And they build a humongous palace, Versailles, to top it all off. They’re rapidly becoming one of the hot favourites in this game. Half a world away Eminent Rome also picks up a wonder… but I can’t figure this one out, it doesn’t appear in any of my Wikias and I don’t recognise it by sight.

It’s not unbelievable that Zheng He was the instigator of this diplomatic coup - as the leader of the Ming Dynasty’s treasure fleets, his job was essentially to convince nations to become tributaries of China through diplomacy and/or intimidation alone. He was a eunuch though. You kind of had a choice in Imperial China - kids or power, pick one not both. Chad Rome has been consolidating their Iberian gains with two more cities - Oea, near the incredibly important Roman city of Tarraco, Tarragona today.

Hopefully something snaps in this war soon. I didn’t even notice until just now but holy hell - South Rome never even built a third city. Pretty humiliating in all honesty. Capital Rome meanwhile have settled loads since we last saw them, and have yet another settler creeping into the bottom of this screen. We can see in the notification at the top that Agrippina has, indeed, fallen to the Gigachads. And Free Rome claims another wonder not much use to us in this game.</p>"

Upper Rome has a merchant league economy, a la medieval Venice, in total contrast to the strict military police state of South Rome. Old Rome appears to have a functioning socialist republic, which is nice to see, while their rivals Shiny Rome is a more traditional imperial state. West Rome is a strict theocracy - I assume one of Anglicanism’s tenets is isolationism.</p>"

Ultimately I think Chad Rome’s riflemen will eventually overcome the resistance, but we’ve seen weirder peace treaties yet. For now though, Chad Rome is firmly on its path to reclaiming all the old Carthaginian lands. Libya and Sicily oughta do it. South Rome and Punished Rome end a war that was going nowhere, and Upper Rome builds… the Gate of the Sun? That’s an ancient era wonder! How has no one built that yet?!

Key to the victory was Carlos III of Spain, who fans of the CBRX will recognise as the current season’s Spanish leader. He’s doing significantly better here than there. A war between Explosive and Capital Rome would be a sight to behold - the Capital Roman forces are already swarming through the area around Hispalis, but with both sides having formidable reserves it would be a very difficult conflict to call.

It’s maybe too much for Broken Rome to take on both of these powerhouses at once, but I wouldn’t rule anything out.
