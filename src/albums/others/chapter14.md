  narration: "<p>Greetings everyone, my name is ExplosiveWatermelon. You might be wondering why I introduce myself in every episode.Anyways, after major bloodshed and the fall of 2 formerly major contenders, as well as not-so-major Sumer, we continue the conflicts where we left off.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter14-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Azande delivered a crushing blow not only to Sierra Leone, but to the whole of the CGR last episode. They now make up a major portion of Africa, and have proven themselves fierce contenders. However, if we look at their core, it seems like they’ll need some time to prepare for the next war. That said, I doubt they’ll be challenged anytime soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The independent Choctaw city of Tuskahoma begins a brand new day, having re-elected mayor Pushmataha for the 417th time. Really, there aren’t any other candidates, and the only one legally allowed to vote is Pushmataha, but he won at least 50% of the votes. “Can’t argue with that,” said one unmotivated citizen.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter14-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>Eystein of Norway’s defense of Tonsberg is so shoddy they might as well have left the door open. Seeking safety, local nobility have teamed up with the commoners in order to compose a letter to Eystein, reading:“Dearest Leader,</p><p></p><p>We know you have a kind heart and open ears, so please, if you have any assistance to save us, we would greatly appreciate it.</p><p></p><p>Regards,</p><p></p><p>-Tonsberg”</p><p></p><p>Eystein sent them, in return, a box of small white flags.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If I had a dollar every time Japan impressed me during a test, I’d have a dime. That said, they’re doing pretty well in the final version of CGR- having successfully occupied Korea. However, much like historic Japanese invasions of Korea, I suspect China’s gonna get involved. For now, Japan made peace with England, having found national unity in making shitty cartoons.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While we’re taking a detour through Asia, I’ve decided to stop by Goguryeo, who seem to be preparing a proper invasion of the Yakut homelands. Tygyn Darkhan better watch out! He’s only a full infantry tech behind!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sun Yat-Sen’s China continues to be a thorn in the side of Rouran- and by thorn I mean cannonball. After taking a huge chunk of Yoogly Moogly’s core, it seems like Yoogly Moogly might even be weaker than Tsakhiagiin. You know what they say- the early Golden Sparrow gets the worm.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Portugal somehow continues its streak of domination by declaring war on Christina and capturing a Swedish colony that I didn’t even know exists. I was so surprised by this capture that I evidently took the screenshot too soon- poor Linkoping has its name censored.</p>"

  scene_title: "Claiming Kingship"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter14-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yup, it’s time.</p><p></p><p>Washakie of the Shoshone hasn’t prepared a force compared to Louis de Buade’s New France, but with that said, the difference in tech is probably going to decide it along with the powerful Shoshone production base. Not to say it’ll be an easy war- in fact, Louis de Buade has a clear path to victory if he can push early- but I don’t suspect New France can bear the burden for long.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shin has been reclaimed by Gwanggaeto’s Riflemen, but there’s a pretty large force in the Japanese city of Mokjeo. I also didn’t realize it until now, but Goguryeo doesn’t have much to protect either. A well-timed invasion could wipe them off the face of the earth.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter14-scene14.jpg

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter14-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems our beloved Grand Commander has an impressive core, but don’t be fooled- if you’ve been paying attention to the infographic at the top, you’ll notice that they’ve fallen back to a middle power. Their lead is diminishing, but they still maintain an impressive military for whenever they do decide to wipe someone off the face of the planet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Barbarians ravage the wastelands near Salt Lake City as Brigham Young pays for his political transgressions of ‘not joining the Liberalism League.’ People are pretty miserable in Salt Lake City- a man can’t love another man for fear of being targeted by his peers, people try to maintain old traditions in spite of changing necessities, and Brigham Young has plastered his name on every building.

  narration: "<p>Presenting Goguryeo- the little orange-red blemish on the face of the cylinder. What can be said? Their uniques are no longer useful, they’re reduced to 2 cities, and they’re losing a war to a civ whose greatest enemy is the American animation industry.
