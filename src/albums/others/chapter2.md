  narration: "<p>Let’s take a brief pause to review.</p><p></p><p>Our last chapter ended with a small lead by Shang, who we can see here is fielding a decent military. If it continues to grow, we can expect good things.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Lawspeaker Jandamarra (Bunuba) represents a majority Oligarch government. The Oligarchs are one of the factions that will decide certain policies that the Bunuba will adopt. Right now, it doesn’t mean much until they have enough sovereignty to adopt these policies, but this is definitely a bold first step for the Bunuba.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sri Jayanasa (Srivijaya) sits in Palembang on a throne made of fine wood and bison leather. God decides that’s pretty cool and gives him the divine right, allowing Srivijaya to establish the world’s first Monarchy! There are various different bonuses to the governments that will be established, and the Monarchy is very different from the Republic that Jandamarra established down under.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Will ‘If the glove fits, the devil’s responsible’ Stoughton (New England) decides that monarchies are okay, and says “Watch this” as he waits for God to establish his divine right. God somewhat obliges, and declares Stoughton a prince, creating the world’s first Principality!</p>"

  narration: "<p>In Egypt, before a person’s death, it has become a tradition for them to pass their tales onto the next generation, slowly creating a collection of family stories that spans history. This grants +1 culture to Plantations for some reason. Who am I to question it? It’s a great choice, considering how much sugar Egypt has available to them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hungary and Pomerania, two very notable underdogs, send off settlers to the east. This could be a very big move for these civilizations which are starting from the bottom. Perhaps this is the start of a rags-to-riches tale?</p><p></p><p>To the south, Lissos is actually quite big.</p>"

  narration: "<p>King Kamehameha puts down his fruity drink as celebrations die off. He points towards the screen featuring the Azande.</p><p></p><p>The Azande are a pretty aggressive civilization, and this slide shows that they’re willing to pump out the units. Once they get their UU, a crossbowman replacement called the Kpinga, it’ll be a long time before anyone can successfully invade Azande land. However, they do have their weaknesses- in that Gbudwe loves his Kpingas way too much.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj (Mongolia) has three cities, as well as having an additional settler at the ready. Rouran, on the other hand, seems to be struggling with their unit composition. If they’re able to properly pump out an army, Rouran could create a strong empire in Northeast Asia.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The results are in for the first Republican election of the Choctaw, and the winner is Pushmataha by unanimous vote. It also helps that he was the only candidate.

  narration: "<p>Nestor Makhno (Makhnovia) sends his forces around Khazar territory. Perhaps this is set up for our first war? Bulan (Khazaria) doesn’t seem to have much of an army prepared. This could prove to be a disastrous opening for Khazaria.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Maravi want to start off with an early tech lead, and they showcase their willingness to enter into the fields of research by constructing the Great Library. Inside is a vast temple of knowledge guarded by the fierce librarians. Those caught breaking in never seem to break out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Olgit (Ket) sets up a bunch of rocks in a circle. Onlookers have no clue how he set up the rocks, but theories range from superhuman strength to telekinesis. One man’s claim that this was an effort by a secret arctic civilization that oversees human progres, and that Chief Olgit is one of many immortals who are participating in a great experiment, goes overlooked.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Good Chief Tupac"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our first Epithet, one of the many JFDLC mods, goes to Tupac Yupanqui (Inca), who gets ‘the Good.’ Each epithet grants a unique bonus, but you can only get a new epithet upon entering a new era. However, being ‘the Good’ doesn’t necessarily mean being ‘the Best.’</p>"

  scene_title: "St. Peter’s Gate"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Let’s talk about Russia- lowly ranking Russia. Yes, they’re not a domination civ, but they do have some valuable bonuses, including the generation of a Great Artist with every Scientist, Merchant, and Engineer earned. However, their UU comes at Rifling, and their UB at Architecture, meaning that they’re relying on their UA for this part of the early game. They’ll have to play their cards right if they want to crawl out of the grave they’ve dug themselves into.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tygyn Darkhan (The Yakuts) opens the doors to the brand-new Temple of Artemis. This is actually one of my favorite wonders- not only does it give a decent production bonus to ranged units, but it gives a bonus to food production in EVERY city. That bonus shouldn’t be overlooked, especially if you’re in the tundra like the Yakuts are.</p>"

  scene_title: "Artemis, you say?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Russians, hearing about the temple constructed in the far east, make it a tradition to make their yearly pilgrimage there in order to offer their finest game to the goddess. Perhaps Elisabeth relates to strong women, somehow?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Japan has 4 cities all settled on Honshu, which is quite an impressive feat. However, these cities are not quite as valuable as a mainland Asian city would be. This might not push Japan towards domination, but it does give them a pretty good edge for now.</p>"

  scene_title: "It begins..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Girls, guys, and GNC gents,</p><p></p><p>It has begun.</p><p></p><p>Fierce General El Cid has appeared out of hiding, ready to command the Shang forces against the Rouran menace! We have entered the next act on the world stage!</p>"

  scene_title: "A to Zealand"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter2-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Let’s talk about New Zealand. As some might’ve noticed, they’ve actually got a decent ranking for an island in the Pacific. How can that be? Well, they have a good combination of abilities that can be useful, including food carried over after growth from Economic buildings. They also have an early UB unlocked at Trapping, although their UU replaces the Artillery. However, don’t count these guys out yet - there’s plenty of fight in the Kiwis.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I wanted to talk about the UFC here, and I will, but I realize now that they actually don’t have any of their unique abilities active yet. However, they’ve got a decent empire, and personally, they were one of my favorite civs during testing. As we see more of them, expect this landscape to change drastically.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Holy shit, what did you do Lula? That’s 5 cities. 5. What are you doing?</p><p></p><p>Okay, but seriously, this is a tremendous gain for Brazil. Perhaps Lula looks to turn the Amazon into an easy tech lead.</p>"
