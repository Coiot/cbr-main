  narration: "<p>Timrtabor: Hello and welcome back to CBRY. For those tuning in for the first time on the second episode for some reason this is a series focused on smaller experimental royales with mechanical changes that would be infeasible in a full game (in this case City States Evolved by Charsi with tweaks by Coiot). Our first full game here is centered on a slimmed down version of the MK2 roster with some of the Civs demoted to city state slots. Think of this as an Elseworlds or “What If?” series in comic book continuity terms. Skies: Hi I’m here too, helping out in parts. Most of the full civs present had a bad showing in Mk2, now’s their chance to shine, as we show off RtP to prep for CBRX2.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbry-season1-episode2-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>Timrtabor: Since this is a new series and original community content is thus a tad limited I’d like to shill my own content I mean highlight an AI game series currently being done on our sister subreddit CivAIGames. The premise is simple: if you decided CBR starting regions by TSL game results, who would come out on top? Rhea, myself, and Nightman are aiming to find out. We currently have 16 of 60ish regions worth of content recorded so plenty to backread if it sounds like your cup of tea. Skies: I’ve also recorded a game for RotG and have been following along closely. Would recommend.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: We start off in Australia, where the Aussies have decided to take us out back for some barbecue. We’ll have to see how much Jandamarra likes that, as he begins spreading the Orthodox word. That Maori navy also looks beefy for Turn 90. Meanwhile, offscreen...</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Osei Tutu grabs Qart Hadasht, making Saladin’s scorching plays all for naught, as he laughs from his Golden Stool. Konongo is under threat but it looks like Saladin will get there in time to reinforce it. In the top right, some intrepid Spartans set out to settle on Cyprus, spreading the world of Leg Day.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: In the new American tradition, a horde of republican thugs are out to try and destroy one of the nation-state’s oldest institutions. Except these are the Buccaneers, and New York is an entire city. It drops into the yellow, as Kingston (which amusingly, is not in Jamaica in this world) has taken no damage, Houston clearly having some kind of problem getting in.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Well then, guess I was wrong about that. The Ashanti claim Konongo, and make themselves Kings of the Sahara. Even if they’re not a Kingdom yet. It works, ok. Dvin is now the last bastion between them and Party Pope Sali-G himself, who now has swordsmen which is a real step up. </p><p></p><p>However, Maria isn’t going to be lazy anymore! She’s had enough of this squabbling and sets out to put her southern neighbours in their place, for their own good. Colonialism never changes. Sparta still hasn’t settled Crete, too busy flexing.</p><p></p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Meiji decides that the Philippines are, like, so far away, and goes back to watching some anime, which in the ancient era I assume is just an actual play with the same surreal tropes. A whole host of wars have broken out meanwhile. Clearly not enough anime over there. China also looks to be approaching the Pearl River Delta, and Hawaii and Korea haven’t done anything. Sad.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Some Irish boats make nuisances of themselves as the fighting grows fierce on the Baltic front. Never fear, though, for Top Kekk has built the Oracle. A device for downloading and playing the latest EA Prophecies, he’s sure to reach the apex of warfare soon. A city-state joined this war earlier but I don’t recall seeing which one it was, it’s probably unimportant.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Anawrahta’s Kyundaw Conscripts are pushing through the central Indian jungle towards Agra, looking to get their swords red to match the as-yet-unconstructed Fort. They’re better when adjacent to enemy cities, and a little better adjacent to other cities. The terrain is definitely slowing down this push, however.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Captain Morgan’s lads stick two fingers up to America, SOPA, and Big Broadband as they take over New York. Times Square now only advertises rum, whilst the World Trade Centre is rebranded the Plunder Exchange. Elsewhere, Kingston drops to half under a barrage of Texan arrows.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: In a quick and tidy bit of diplomacy by Salazzle, he’s reobtained Konongo in a peace deal with Osei Tutu. The Ashanti boss is having a rough time of it too, as Maria’s navy instantly captures Qart Hadasht and looks to be supported by a hefty land force. Will be interesting to see if Portugal can break into the Sahara.</p><p></p><p>Day 1432. Sparta still hasn’t settled.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: Trigger Darkhan has a message for the sub. If you give five units today, he can send them fruitlessly towards the Ashanti, only to inevitably have peace made before the get there. Rap songs aplenty will be written in your honor! Just think, one unit sent today could see a hero’s welcome in a few hundred years’ time. Call now, at 0800-666-CBRY, to donate. You could be the difference, between life, and many painful deaths on a hellish, 10000km forced march. Thank you.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hello Everyone, it’s me, ExplosiveWatermelon. You may be wondering what I’m doing narrating this part? The answer is simple- I’m staging a coup.</p><p></p><p>EW: In relevant news, we see a Buccaneer settler on a mission. Reports say they’ve found some weird fruit. Best not to eat before swimming.</p><p></p><p>Yankton finds its home on the Northwest Coast, while we get a quick look at Honolulu. Unfortunately, unlike some sad horse shows, there is no road from Hawaii to the mainland. They’re kind of just stuck there, vibing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>EW: Iceland does what it does best- settling islands that aren’t Iceland. Here, they’ve gladly incorporated the Faroe Islands into their empire. Unfortunately, there aren’t too many islands left in this area.</p><p></p><p>--MEANWHILE IN THE EMERALD ISLES--</p><p></p><p>The Irish Empire debates the meaning of their existence. What point is there to a united Ireland if there’s no England to spite? After all is said and done, perhaps there is no Ireland without an England to rival it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>EW: Chile built the Great Wall, which gives us a chance to look at the hidden dragons of this game- that is, the South American civs.</p><p></p><p>If you remember from Mark 2, a reset caused Brazil to come out on top as the victor. While that’s not necessarily a sign that there’s advantages to South America, there are some traits that make South America a particularly good region to have control over. Most notably, it’s very fortified and has plenty of Jungle to help produce Science. I’m keeping a particular eye on the Inca, who have a very solid start and some strong growth bonuses. They could potentially pull ahead once Universities become available.</p><p></p><p>Salvador was settled by Brazil, giving the Mk. 2 victors their third city. </p>"

  narration: "<p>EW: Finland’s defense proves itself highly effective. They’re getting dominated, yes, but it’s at peak efficiency. This could prove to be bad for Kekkonen- he needs to rein in Casimir before it’s too late.</p>"

  scene_title: "Act of Agra-ssion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbry-season1-episode2-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>EW: Burma’s invasion isn’t going quite so well, which gives me the opportunity to talk about India a bit.</p><p></p><p>India is perhaps the hardest region to break out in. There’s mountains blocking off most paths, and the terrain is particularly rough. It’s good for turtling, for sure, but unfortunately unless you can develop a Navy, the odds are you’re not going to do well in India. Burma, however, is not in India, and has plenty of room to expand. Why they choose to expand into India, I don’t know.</p>"

  narration: "<p>EW: Amongst the Kimberley people, there is a legend about a great counsel- the man who speaks law, Jandamarra the Brave. The story about how he got his name was simple- they were handing out Epithets one day and Jandamarra proudly proclaimed himself ‘the Brave.’ Nobody could argue with that confidence.</p><p></p><p>So, with their newly Braved leader, the Kimberley gathered their poor and huddled masses, and set off for greener pastures.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this is Australia.

  narration: "<p>EW: GASP! This unforeseen event totally didn’t happen several slides ago, where it went unnoticed! Yes, Portugal took Utique from the Ashanti, giving Maria a solid base in Africa. This could be a huge step towards world domination- Africa is full of City-States, and there’s not too much competition. It’s a relatively easy option for expansion, should Maria venture further.</p>"

  narration: "<p>EW: The Yakuts have settled four cities, putting them ahead of some Major Civilizations.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Buccaneers are clearly making a genius play. They’ve got their capital in the Carribean, yes, but settling Siberia to get more land? That’s honestly not too bad of an idea. All they’d have to do is defend their capital while they expand into Asia. Of course, in Siberia there’s not too much to expand into, besides City-States. I, for one, welcome this expansion. </p>"

Utique, which frankly sounds Portuguese, falls to Maria’s land troops as her trireme snipers sail round the Atlantic coast. Coiot’s all-powerful cursor draws our attention to some African Forest Sheep. Less powerful than elephants, these were used to train Carthaginian babies prior to the Punic Wars.</p>"

  narration: "<p>EW: Maria has somehow snuck a settler all the way to Arabia without my noticing. Damn.</p><p></p><p>This city is rather undefended, but could serve a vital role in future colonial expansion if it develops further. I think it’s funny, though. Civ 5 AIs don’t really have a bias that encourages them to settle far away, and yet Maria did it. Historically accurate, yes, but surprising nonetheless.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Skies: As we close out with a shot of a heavily militarized North America, I’ll leave you with a small, tiny bit of history. San Antonio used to host an international exhibition, from 1888-1911. Described as “as fine a line of exhibits from mills and factories as was ever shown at any fair south of St. Louis”, it was Texas’s equivalent of the World’s Fair. With prizes worth over 12000 dollars (over 300k today!), it was a pretty substantial, but almost entirely forgotten event. It’s almost impossible that this cylinder’s San Antonio will produce such history, but if there was such a world it could happen, this might be it.</p>"

I opted not to use our new religions expansions for this game and it meant there were not enough beliefs to support more than nine religions. Wakan Tanka is off to a good lead considering its spread on both sides of the world and being uncontested in the Americas.</p>"
