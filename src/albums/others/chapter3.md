  narration: "<p>In review of the last part, we had our first conflicts, including the Shoshone’s conflict with Texas which resulted in a great expansion of their empire. Washakie is a force to be reckoned with already, but treacherous terrain will make it hard to expand elsewhere.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Another winner from last episode is Makhnovia! Nestor Makhno’s home city of Huliaipole is the base for a thriving anarchist empire… Wait, isn’t that contradictory? </p><p></p><p>In any case, with Atil in their grasp, they hold the most capitals so far. If they can keep up the pressure, Makhnovia may become a force to be reckoned with.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sam ‘The Zemurray Man’ Banana leads the UFC into the Medieval age, being the first to do so. This suggests that they have a pretty decent tech lead, considering a lot of civs JUST entered the classical era!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Bulan (Khazaria) makes peace with Nestor Makhno- a crucial move but ultimately too costly, as they part with Samandar in the trade deal. Having divided their empire, Khazaria can only keep digging their own grave at this point, hoping that they’ll strike gold.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Bengal, in a critical peace deal, holds onto the two cities it captured previously: Mayurkhandi and Pattakadal. With the large-scale empire they’re forming, they could easily be one of the first major contenders. Time tells all, however.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Sweden gets the Forum Magnum and the Azande make white peace with Yemen.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Stockholm is the center of the Swedish Kingdom, but what exactly can we expect from Sweden? While they don’t have their UU or UB yet, the Pinnace and Konstpalats respectively, they’re in a pretty good position. Norway to the North is relatively weak, Finland is wide open, and for a naval civ to have control of the Baltic Sea? Hell, they could create a pretty decent empire.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Timur has a pretty decent shot at victory. Not only does he have a large empire, but a lot of the available land at his disposal can give incredible yields- lots of freshwater, salt, and even some floodplains and oases? Those cities can rack up population, and given that the Timurids do get some science bonuses as well, they might be able to form a large tech lead.</p>"

Nestor Makhno must be quaking in his boots, surely- they’ve sent a total of 4 warriors, with another on the way!</p><p></p><p>In all seriousness, if Tyushtya can scrap together his forces, there could be a decent push here against the Makhnovist Menace.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah. It’s no wonder China’s winning. They have Zhukov, a man with so many medals that you could melt them down into yet another statue of Zhukov. A man with so many war honors that he could give 1 away each day and at the end of the year, he’d still have a net gain.</p><p></p><p>The Titan who felled Hitler. Yeah, that’s who’s leading the Chinese offensive.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If you look south of Kashiwabara, you’ll see the Torii- Japan’s unique improvement! It’s a wonderful little unique, but it seems Japan only has 1 so far. In any case, this allows us to get a better look at what Japan has been doing with their land, as well as giving us the opportunity to talk about the island nation.</p><p></p><p>Japan has a Composite Bowman replacement, which they should be getting soon, and obviously the Torii. However, they’re a civ more focused on Faith than anything else, and it’s hard to say whether the civ has much of a fighting chance.
