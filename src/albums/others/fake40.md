  narration: "<p>Ah, the beautiful Western Europe countryside. I’m surprised Scotland made it to Endgame — they seemed to be in a real pickle last time we saw them. I could’ve sworn they’d be dead by now. Anyways, there’s also Prague, right where it belongs in Northwest Germany, and Brno.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Onto Northern Africa. Seeing Songhai make it to Endgame is no surprise. After their strong start they would have had to try to lose in order to be eliminated. Algeria on the other hand made it thanks to a single Dey. Also featured are Libya, Minoa, Ottomans, and a curious smattering of Ndongo units.</p>"

Our competitors include Muscovy, the Golden Horde, Two-Swords-Land, and the Seljuks. Thankfully the people didn’t vote for Putin, so we’ve got Ivan in Moscow instead.</p>"

Hey, wait a minute, isn’t this the same picture that was on the power ranking slide? How did those damn PR’s get it? Have they been getting advance access to the part this whole time?

Of course, the Murri are an extremely formidable foe, and considering how easily they eliminated Australia prior to Endgame, it might be hard to face them down when they have a whole continent to themselves.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ivan expands east, a good move considering the vast stretch of empty land east of the Urals. Of course he has the Seljuks to thank for that, since they improbably eliminated the Kazakhs pre-E, making a remarkable comeback after being temporarily reduced to a single tile.</p>"

  narration: "<p>SMH I can’t believe how inaccurate this is. The Selk’nam? Worshipping a deity other than my Garfield OC? However, with three cities and the Temple of Artemis, the Selkies (Editor’s note: Please don’t call them that) are sure to be a powerhouse in the region.

  narration: "<p>Az-zawiyah must be the toughest city on the planet because Songhai is attacking it with MULTIPLE WARRIORS and it still has not fallen. It just smells so damn good that the Songhai army doesn’t really want to attack it. The damage is caused by one warrior literally just inhaling too forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Note that Poverty Point is now worshipping the Old Man Above, a.k.a. Nebuchadnezzar.
