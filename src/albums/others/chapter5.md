  narration: "<p>Hello friends! Welcome back to the Civ Grand Royale. In the last episode we saw some empires fall from grace while others took leaps and bounds towards victory. In particular, the devastating collapse of the Almohads has piqued my personal interest. How shall the world cope when faced with the collapse of a civilization? Let’s find out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sierra Leone hungers for the first elimination in this royale, but it looks like there’s a few obstacles in the way first- namely, a coalition has formed against them. However, Sierra Leone has the high ground for now.Also of note, that’s a Marajoara Settler looking to settle the Western Sahara.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Timurids topped the power rankings after a few parts of Shoshone domination. What could this mean? Are we bearing witness to the fabled Timurid game? Legends have told of this day, when a shunned power restores its legacy of its own merit- this could be it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While the focus is on the Illyrians’ invasion of hungary, let’s talk about the UUs present on the field- the Lembos and the Sibyna Spearman. The Lembos helps embarked units move faster and is weak and cheap- plus if adjacent to several other Lemboses, the units are much stronger against enemy naval units. Meanwhile, the only relevant bonus the Sibyna Spearman is gonna get is a speed bonus near Coastal tiles. Overall, a very naval-focused civ. Not helpful for a land invasion.</p>"

  narration: "<p>England’s been amassing a lot of land, but none of it seems to go north of York. However, we do see Henry V fielding the first of his UUs- the Longbowman. It’s like the vanilla Longbowman, but it finds better use in the hands of the Henriac forces.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shu Han is getting invaded by Rouran, who look to take Wenshan. What could make this worse?China’s invasion, obviously. The impressive carpet Sun Yat-Sen fields compared to the empty lands Liu Bei has gives a stark contrast, and one that won’t go unnoticed.</p>"
