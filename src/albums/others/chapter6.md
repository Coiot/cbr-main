  narration: "<p>Welcome back! My name is /u/ExplosiveWatermelon and I make civs like I make bad decisions-</p><p></p><p>Quite a few in a short amount of time.</p><p></p><p>Last we left off, 3 Civilizations got eliminated: The Almohads, New England, and Pomerania. Of the three, the Almohads were probably the biggest surprise from when we started off, given that they were a pretty decent civ in all performances. However, AI games combine a number of factors, and this just wasn’t their day.</p><p></p><p>Sierra Leone was also getting eaten by Sokoto, before Sokoto itself got eaten by Luba. Let’s take a look, shall we?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Shoshone, led by the infallible Washakie, have left a huge blister upon the face of North America. Not only have they chipped off Texas, but they also hold the capital of the Choctaw. However, they don’t field an elimination yet- the only elimination in North America so far has been that of New England by New France.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Ket declared war on Yuge Muge of Rouran, but perhaps their biggest threat is the growing Kazakh presence. Good luck breaking through to Woulouhou.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Let’s begin!</p><p></p><p>Stavropol has been captured by one of the most unique Unique Units on the face of the planet- the Meadow Ski-Axeman, which sounds like grant randomly rolled adjectives and added them together until they made sense. In any case, the Eastern Finns hold Stavropol at this point and are likely to hold on to it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Bauh has been captured by the Wahgi. King James Brooke is looking to get Sarawak’d off. However, it should be mentioned that the Wahgi are a notable underperformer from tests, and yet seem to have a powerful empire forming in this game.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter6-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Bengal is one of the most notable civs on this side of the cylinder- having been a constant overperformer in tests, and an easy powerhouse. Not only are they militarily competent, their growth bonuses make them a threat to early neighbors, such as the diminutive Rashtrakuta. The Paik is actually a UU I helped design, and it’s pretty strong near rivers and while stacked with naval units. If you couldn’t guess, this region is mostly rivers.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter6-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well, Sokoto’s pretty much down and out. Their last city isn’t even annexed. Perhaps it’s time to explain a bit of why Sokoto got in-</p><p></p><p>Sokoto was an inside joke because a member of the dev team, DarthKyofu, had a dream about CBRX where Jamaica was eliminated by Sokoto, who wasn’t appearing in the game. Thus, it was determined that this would be ‘good banter’ if we included them in CGR. It was not. Moving on.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Guaycuru declare war on Kaweskar, and Marajoara joins in, but don’t be fooled by Kaweskar’s lack of any military or skill- the terrain gives them a distinct advantage. That is, if Guaycuru doesn’t just use boats.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-chapter6-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Mixtecs are currently sitting in a comfortable hole they’ve dug for themselves. Not only have they failed in all military manners, but they manage to outdo themselves each time they fail. They previously gave up Tlaxiaco to the UFC, who quite frankly could never have taken the city by force. It’s just not in the nature of the UFC to steal territory in Central America.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Louis de Buade sets his gaze to the remnants of the Choctaw empire- a smart move if he wants to pull ahead of the Shoshone, but ultimately it seems the Shoshone have already made the deciding play, having split Tuskahoma from Puskus Takali with a well-placed citadel.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sokoto has made a decisive peace with Luba, thus securing the safety of their empire. Who could’ve convinced Ilunga Sungu of the Luba of such a treaty? None other than the great Sokoto general, Charles Martel!I mean, they probably could’ve used that earlier.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh dear, it seems James Brooke has misplaced Lundu in the Wahgi Empire. Sarawak’s irrelevance comes at their own volition, it seems, as the White Rajah gives up his own city to appease the warlord of Southeast Asia.</p><p></p><p>The most upsetting part is that the warlord is the Wahgi Empire.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mayi falls to Nursultan’s “Supreme Forces of the Consolidate empire of Kazakhstan, the greatest country in the world, or at least in Central Asia.” It’s gonna be hard for Rouran to send forces to defend Woulouhou, but it’s gonna be even harder for me to continually type that name.</p>"

I took Kyudo for a bit, and I can tell you it’s not really that well-suited for combat, but of course that’s because the modern tradition evolved from a post-war ideology.
