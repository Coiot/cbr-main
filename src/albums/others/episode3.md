    narration: "<p>It’s not every day that somebody gets exiled from the submarine. This was a special occasion; my friend, Bel Buruk, happened to leak the future. One of the most prized possessions of Nebuchadnezzar, he told of an event that was to be- the fall of Kyoto to Chinese naval forces. However, Bel failed to realize that once the future is released, it cannot be recaptured.</p><p></p><p>There’s no reason the city shouldn’t have fallen today. Yet it seems that knowing the future changes the future. Thus, the city still stands, as the naval forces fall to the depths of the sea. You know what they say-</p><p></p><p>Loose lips sink ships.</p>"

Ever since she was told by the Babylonian emissary, she knew things would be different from that day on. Now, as her city faces a deadly siege, she receives what can only be described as an ephemeral voice- the singing of a choir, within a large hall, only to be silenced suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Time works to correct itself, and the city of Buenos Aries falls in the place of Kyoto. The consequences are still not felt, however.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Ayyubid forces have once again engaged the Ashanti. The Ayyubids are a particularly faithful bunch- they couldn’t understand the belief of the Ashanti to bow before no god. Don’t they feel fear? Do they think that there is no cruelness to their way of life, that they should not be afraid of their creator who could force upon them such horror?</p><p></p><p>Or worse, could they believe that there is no being so vile to create such a universe.</p>"

It was better to keep the citizens out of war, but food supplies were growing limited- the citizens started to question his command.</p><p></p><p>In Sioux territory, a grand construct emerges from the Earth. This is their act of rebellion against their gods- for a people fated never to hold the Earth, they served only to spite the balance of the world. The Texans laugh at the irony- for this construct signals to them only what they had once said before.</p><p></p><p>“Come and take it”</p>"

Still, the newfound settlement of Reydarfjall confused the citizens. Was this some sort of joke? There’s no sea here, no source of food.

For good reason- nobody should bear witness to a king. If they did, they would realize he was only human.</p><p></p><p>Could a human have created an empire as great as Armenia?

Did I make myself clear?”</p><p></p><p>No man could deny Chief Houston. There was something about him which seemed unhuman… or perhaps a bit too human.

The chieftain speaks, “I hear you’ve got the vision over all plains.”</p><p></p><p>“Yes, I suppose you could say that,” Bel started, “It’s the ability to see through the lives of every being on the planet. Within a moment, I could experience a thousand lives from start to finish. In fact, I’ve seen where your path leads. This knowledge comes at a cost though.”</p><p></p><p>“Tell me!” The Chieftain begged.</p><p></p><p>It seems like only a moment passes, but the eyes of Bel went hollow for a moment. Then, he gave a curious look, as if something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>“Your death will be mourned by only a single girl,” Bel took a sip of the warm drink, nested in his hands. “You’ll have abandoned everything else, and in the end you’ll abandon her too. But now, you’ll ask me what it means, and I’ll tell you right now there is no metaphor. That’s simply the cost of such knowledge.”</p><p></p><p>Somewhere, time shifts once more. Chief Houston speaks to his generals.</p><p></p><p>“On second thought, the Pirates aren’t enough. We’ll conquer all of America, and if we make an enemy of the world, we’ll conquer them too!”</p>"

They’re limited in resources, and Aotearoa itself isn’t the most productive place.”</p><p></p><p>“Nonsense.

Mao himself sat upon his throne, his short stature seemingly more intense in comparison to the large warped wood that formed the seat. He watched his court celebrate the fall of a city, as Mao wonders how he ever pulled it off.</p><p></p><p>“My lord,” a court eunuch spoke to Mao, “You’ve a guest.”</p><p></p><p>“At this time?” Mao questioned, “Well, I admire their courage. Whatever they say must be good.”</p><p></p><p>Introduced to the court was a rather small fellow, with bronze skin and brown hair, who patiently greeted every courtier who crossed his path.</p><p></p><p>“Greetings, Lord Zedong,” he bowed to the lord, “My name is Bel Buruk.”</p>"

For now, war is war.”</p><p></p><p>The men silenced themselves. They couldn’t argue he’s wrong… But until they’ve won what?</p>"

That’s why, to live their lives under siege, is but the bravest act.</p><p></p><p>The Portuguese fleet is held back- though reinforcements are sure to come. However, there’s not one person in panic. They remain terrified, yes, but they’ve accepted their fate- yet defy it all by living all the same. Really, all are faced with death… Except Osei Tutu.</p><p></p><p>The Ashanti king had never known death. He knows love for his people, he knows all the traits of a true leader… yet he cannot leave his palace. Why were the citizens so eager to live, knowing death would meet them?</p>"

What happens from this point on is entirely new. Smerdis could no longer predict which wars Houston would enter- Sam’s mind was so crossed that his next enemy could’ve been Texas itself.

It was admirable, albeit Pearson knew it was futile.</p><p></p><p>Pearson adjusted his bowtie- you had to look good for your people. One look at the man could tell you he was not meant for war- which was why he had stayed hidden for so long. Now, it was time to step up.

The Portuguese were astonished- the archers that had held them back weren’t a professional regiment. They weren’t even well equipped. It was just… people. A citizen regiment that held them off for so long just so they could live a normal life. The Portuguese almost turned back out of guilt, when their commander came out.</p><p></p><p>“No, men,” the Admiral-General spoke, “You may think they’re regular citizens, but they’re soldiers all the same. Furthermore, we’re citizens of our home, and we’ve picked up our swords for the same reason they picked up their bows. All we can promise them is a time to rest- they’ve lost whether we leave or not.”</p><p></p><p>The sailors who were bold enough marched through the halls of the palace.

Thus, she declares war on the Ashanti people, as well as her former ally the Ayyubids. All the pieces were coming together.</p><p></p><p>Maria could not be said to be the wisest ruler. However, none had the courage she possessed- and with good reason. Maria may be considered mad, sometimes even lazy. But it was for these opportunities in particular that she had waited. She never took a rest. She spent all her time making sure things went perfect.</p><p></p><p>Africa holds a strong resource base. The Jungles in the Congo were ripe for research, and it was only these two fools in her way. She had already set her foot down on the continent- now it was time to prove her worth.</p><p></p><p>If any madness had become of Maria, it was only out of duty.</p>"
