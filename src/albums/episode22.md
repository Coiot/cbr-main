  narration: "<p>Greetings fellow gamer dudes and dudettes, and welcome back to another amazing episode of CBRX. My name is /u/Ludicologuy00, but there are some who call me Ludi. Most people know me as ‚Äúthat üéà guy from 3-4 years ago‚Äù, but nowadays I mostly lurk while sometimes submitting power rankings on time. But that‚Äôs enough about me, let‚Äôs move on to some OC.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Some have noticed, by sifting through the ‚ÄúCBRX Info Sheet‚Äù, that Uruguay has begun researching Atomic Theory. The poor Amazon rainforest can‚Äôt seem to catch a break. Even in the digital world, it will end up being burned down by fire. Nuclear fire that is.</p><p></p><p>Credit to: /u/Chicago_Ball for the image.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This week‚Äôs map is provided by /u/Vihreea and includes some hand-drawn borders. You should definitely give it a closer look if you‚Äôve got some time to spare since we‚Äôll see some major border changes in some regions this part. </p>"

  narration: "<p>And here‚Äôs another edition of SPOR, the diagram that shows us all relevant wars by /u/ThyReformer. By looking at this map we can see a few nations that might have a(nother) tough part ahead of them, namely Songhai, M√©tis, the HRE, Papua, and Nazca. Will they persevere or fall flat on their faces? Stay tuned and find out for yourself.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>By taking a sneak peek at the power rankings chart, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that Uruguay will come out at the top once more for the 13th part in a row. But that‚Äôs not surprising considering that they are about to field planes and nuclear bombs against their green neighbour‚Äôs cannons and crossbows.</p><p>Coiot: Can't escape :cursedguay: this week.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Moving over to eastern Europe, we arrive just in time to see Frederick the Great take Vladimir from Ivan the Terrible. The odds of Vladimir being flipped by Ivan are slim to none, while the risk of Ivan being eliminated slowly increases each and every turn. </p><p></p><p>Right outside of Suzdal, a Prussian Landwehr (one of the Prussian UUs) is showing off his fancy new uniform, fine goosestep, and impressive +15% combat ability for standing next to an allied unit (which increases to +30% if next to another Landwehr).</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hwangju falls into the hands of Shikoku, expelling Korea from Korea. This may end up being the last city capture of this war (or at least for a very long time) since neither side really possesses the number of military units required to push up to, siege down, and take a city from their opponent. </p>"

  scene_title: "Gold makes monsters of men"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>And here we see a fleet of Uruguayan pirate ships raiding what I suppose is a single military vessel from Songhai escorting a smaller squadron of trade ships. The Uruguayan pirates must have heard about the great riches of the gold coast and therefore decided to bring everything they had against this ship. Let‚Äôs just hope that civilian casualties were kept to a minimum‚Ä¶ eh, who am I kidding. We are here because we love massive amounts of simulated bloodshed, who then would care about some poor sailors in the middle of the Atlantic?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Winnipeg takes some more damage in the Iroquois-M√©tis war while Wood Mountain also receives some damage. Some red and blue units have arrived to garrison Fort Maurepas, but that may not have been necessary since the northern parts of Iroquois realm seem surprisingly empty of units.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Sea of Cannons"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>One day the Moorish admirals asked themselves if it was really necessary to build huge boats for their cannons when they get smaller ones for free by just disembarking them. This led to the scene you are currently witnessing, a carpet filled with disembarked cannons taking Hombori, and about to take Niani and Araouane. Was this just a fluke, or have we just witnessed a new major advancement in naval strategy? Only time will tell.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Perth is dangerously close to flipping now, and Rajapapua has no way of stopping it. Rumours say that he has already fled to Bunbury and that that is why the whole fleet is anchored there instead of trying to stop the Kiwi navy.</p><p></p><p>Not too far south from Perth, Gambu Ganuurru watches closely as the siege continues. This may be the last shot at glory Murri will receive, but it‚Äôs also a great opportunity not to rock the boat and take the attention of Bob Hawke away from Seddon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The collapse of the HRE continues as the Vikings begin sieging Augsburg and both the Vikings and Venice have units standing at the gates of Aachen. Aachen will probably hold unless the Venetian army makes some really aggressive moves while Augsburg may be at the risk of falling, facing both siege, ranged, and naval units while two fully healed melee units are close by.</p>"

  scene_title: "And my axe!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Konstantiniyye is once more in the hands of Palmyra! On a more interesting note, take a look at those warriors that Havel is still fielding. It‚Äôs almost like he believes that we aren‚Äôt about to enter the atomic era in a few more turns. It will be interesting to see what units he‚Äôll be fielding when his neighbours are building tanks‚Ä¶ assuming that he survives long enough for that to happen.</p>"

  scene_title: "The corps of Madagascar"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>A new peacekeeping corps from Madagascar has formed in eastern Benin. They could potentially move west and take part in the coalition against Songhai (since Ranavalona has already declared war on Askia), but going off of what AI usually do in CBR I‚Äôd guess that they‚Äôll just stay there for an eternity and a half.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>While things are looking somewhat dicey on Riel‚Äôs eastern front, he seems to have a much better grip on the western front. With some luck, he could potentially take both Tanu and Sukkwan. He won‚Äôt, however, be able to take and hold any Haidan coastal cities since he has no way of dealing with Koyah‚Äôs massive naval carpet.</p>"

  scene_title: "That‚Äôs got to be the best admiral I‚Äôve ever seen"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Araouane falls and Niani is on its last legs as the disembarked canons continue to wreak havoc on the West African Coast. Askia must develop a countermeasure and swiftly put it into use if he doesn‚Äôt want to lose all of his coastal holdings before the part ends.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: ""
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Adelaide flips and with the number of land units that Hawke has brought to this front, I would be surprised if Seddon still found a way to take and hold the city for an extended amount of time. It might be a good idea for the kiwi fleet to retreat, regroup, and rethink their plan of attack before every ship is spent on flipping a single one pop city.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Did anybody say ‚ÄúTonga Time‚Äù?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tonga and Iroquois sign a peace treaty with Nazca while Selk‚Äônam sends a laughably small invasion force to take Cahuachi. Omar Mukhtar has decided that he doesn‚Äôt like being a ghost and blamed all of his mistakes on Ablai Khan.</p><p></p><p>And since we have an ideology pop-up on the screen, I‚Äôll mention all of the civs that got one this part:</p><p></p><p>New Zealand, Shikoku, Prussia, Kazakhs, Venezuela, Nazca, M√©tis, and the Vikings all go for autocracy while the HRE goes for order just to piss off the Vikings even more.</p>"

  scene_title: ""
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>As we move back to the Iroquois-M√©tis war we see that Winnipeg has fallen and Wood Mountain has taken a lot of damage. Riel has mostly ranged units in the area so recapturing these cities may be a bit harder to do then you‚Äôd expect, but Hiawatha also lacks a substantial amount of melee units, so he might be unable to push much further for some time now.</p>"

  scene_title: "Twice the size..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>And now for a shot of Benin‚Äôs invasion of Songhai. Both Kangaba and Djenn√© have taken substantial damage and may fall in the next couple of turns. With this shot, we can also take note of Songhai‚Äôs lack of a real army. I counted roughly 30 military units in this picture which is comparable to the number of civilian units also present in this slide.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As expected, Niani falls and in addition to this, a handful of Moorish units have made it past Mascara and could att a few different cities. Askia must mobilize a large army ASAP if he wants to stand a fighting chance against the foreign invaders.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The kiwis have taken Perth and Rajapapua has immediately decided, from his secret hiding spot in Bunbury, to make Baruni his new capital. Not too far from the new Papuan capital, a Japanese settler has found an empty plot of land to potentially settle, right next to an old, abandoned holy site. </p>"

  narration: "<p>While Augsburg flips from the HRE to the Vikings and back again back on the mainland, an exiled Scottish Squadron on Greenland watches as the Vikings attempt to take the city of Strassbourg. If they manage to do so, they‚Äôll also get to keep it as the roman emperor won‚Äôt have any way of flipping it back.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Winnipeg once again flies the red and blue banner and as I mentioned last time we took a peek at this area, Hiawatha barely has any melee units left on the frontline (I think the unit south-west of Wood Mountain might be an Iroquois pikeman), so expect this front to stall some more.</p>"

  scene_title: "Silently watching from the sidelines"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode22-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ewuare‚Äôs invasion has achieved its first major accomplishment by somewhat swiftly taking Djenn√©, and soon we might see another city fall into their hands. While Benin is winning tremendously, Nubia is watching from the sidelines with their almost completely filled, but somewhat outdated carpet. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if Piye decides to join in on the coalition or if they will try their luck once more on Benin if they overextend themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Goths and Sami also made peace, but I can‚Äôt tell from the minimap if anything has flipped since their colours are somewhat similar, hopefully we‚Äôll get a closer look soon.</p>"

But here‚Äôs a picture confirming that it‚Äôs still the case.</p><p></p><p>I‚Äôll also take this moment that the Seljuqs have made peace with a lot of its former enemies this part, because why not.

  narration: "<p>In a somewhat surprising move, Qing DoWs both Yup‚Äôik and the Apache. This may backfire as the Yup‚Äôik outgun them in Siberia and could maybe use that advantage to take cities from them. But upon closer inspection of the slide you‚Äôll notice that half of the New Ice Sheet Fleet is stranded on an actual Ice Sheet, so maybe not.</p>"

Fish Creek, Cut Knife, Battleford, Duck Lake, and Fishing Lake are all lightly defended and could swiftly fall if Geronimo goes all-in on the offensive. This could also end the stalemate to the east, as long as Hiawatha decides to bring some more melee units there.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Kiwis have recaptured Myede but in the meantime, Paeroa has fallen to Taungoo. It seems to me like the current situation favours Bayinnaung over Seddon. Sure, Seddon might have a few more ships in the area but they are a bit outdated, especially when compared with Taungoo‚Äôs powerful ship at the western edge of the scene.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Venitian advance on Liberec and Aachen slowly carries on while Augs- and Regensburg continue to burn. To the east, we can see a few units approaching Brno, but that attack will hardly go anywhere. The Venetian core looks worryingly empty, so maybe the Doge should prioritize creating a favourable peace deal over fighting more in this costly war.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of peace deals; it seems like Frederick knows better than to go after Moscow, opting for a peace deal instead. This will ensure that Ivan gets to live on for a few more turns.</p>"

If they succeed in capturing the city, there‚Äôs no telling how badly the locals will be treated by these foreign, loot hungry invaders. Knowing this, a handful of workers are attempting to escape the city on rafts under the cover of a cloudy night. It seems like they‚Äôve made it past the blockade, but now the real trials begin. Will they be able to survive mother nature while at sea for several years in a row, or will their rafts be hit by a stray cannonball and sink, leaving no survivors? Well, the Uruguayans have just finished building a huge statue of Jesus, so that may be a good sign for these civilians.</p>"
