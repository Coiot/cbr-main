  narration: "<p>Welcome one and all to another episode of the Civilization Battle Royale! After a hiatus, 37 rebooted parts, another long hiatus, and another 18 parts, for a total time of just shy of three years to the day, this is u/X-Rok once again stepping in for a narration. It’s good to be back, let’s get into it.</p><p>Coiot: It really is three years since the last Mk 2.0 release.</p>"

  narration: '<p>JFD: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mxXSEdtRQg21r-E-ojnFcfQNUOEuX0px">In this eleventh issue</a>, we take an extended and self-reflective look at some of the recent civ mods to have been released. Deliverator also embarks on his first part in a series aiming to look at the way in which the natural world is depicted in the civ series. And we speak with the modders that made the 12 Days of Africa about their experiences.</p>'

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>We open with the Apache and Metis clash in the American midwest, Frog Lake being pillaged and surrounded. A strong complement of crossbows led by a healthy force of four Cuirassiers, the Enlightenment Era horseback unit, has already brought it to the yellow, and their chances look good.</p><p></p><p>The Metis make a push of their own into Dzilthdaklizhéndé making some noise, but it may not end well as Apache reinforcements in the area flank around them.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>On to the Kuikuro-Iroquois conflict in the Caribbean, where Itsagahiti has been decimated. Iroquois captured it since it was last seen last part, and Kuikuro recaptured it before the end of the part, leaving it undetected on the end of part maps. But this may be the final flip, as Kuikuro’s naval force is cut off, outnumbered, and outgunned.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ewuare’s troops retake Eko, a lone Cuirassier making its way into the city, and a couple Pikemen knock at the gates of Ewohimi. Piye seems unconcerned with the loss of these gains, focusing his few melee units in the region on the push on Udo.</p>"

  scene_title: "Salya’Hard Times"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Finding that their colours look really good in the frozen north, the Kazakhs continue onwards, trying to make the Nenets not actually exist like the rumors say they don’t. Salya’Harad flips, from 20 to 10 to 5, and likely to 2 as the assault advances.</p><p></p><p>Ablai Khan also makes an interesting move, offering support in a coalition war with the Yup’ik against Korea.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Kazakhxy Brain play"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>And by ‘offering support’ I mean talking them right into a trap. Kazakh units will not be participating in this theater of war, the exclave of Naparyarraq is scarcely garrisoned and isolated, and the only route for Yup’ik units is a one tile gap between Haida territory that is also a one tile island, blocking naval support completely. A contingent of land units make their way through to the Korean borders, likely to be slaughtered.</p>"

  scene_title: "Burn It Down"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Calgary is captured and set ablaze again, although Canada will have one last chance later in the turn to save it delay the inevitable. Louis Riel seems intent on burning down the last of these Canadian-founded cities, and certainly dedicated forces to this area to do it. We’ll see if he looks to finish the job afterwards.</p><p></p><p>An impromptu Scoutcon 2210 Hudson’s Bay breaks out as a New Zealand scout has found his way through open borders with the Iroquois to witness this event, and bumps into a possibly trapped Kazakh scout.</p>"

  scene_title: "Tactical Retreat?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Prussia repairs what they can in Bergen and shuffles their navy around a bit, but with no new land units in sight it seems Frederick is prepared to loose their foothold across the sea. A navy can retake a city, but against the land army the Vikings are marching in, it will not hold, only further demolish the city.</p><p></p><p>Venice and Beta Israel join the dogpile on Ndongo, and Korea and Haiti declare on Papua? I don’t see any of them making it to Relevant status.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "The Battle for the Isle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Viking reinforcements make their way across the waters as the Manx Crossbow corps have Port Erin surrounded. It won’t be taken by land, but that embarked Knight can make it around the coast next turn.</p><p></p><p>Haida and Maratha join in on Papua, still not likely to be Relevant… but that does have Korea and Haida fighting on the same side, maybe that will have further repercussions for the Yup’ik.</p><p></p><p>Nubia and Ndongo also start up a coalition against Parthia...</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "The Gothic Acquisition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>And I think I know who rounded up the irrelevant supporters. Taungoo declares on Parthia as well, followed by the nation seeking to do most of the conquering here, the Goths. Parthia’s core is depleted from fighting in the mountains to the south for hundreds of years, and Alaric wishes to ride in those northern fields and fertile desert flood plains. The troops aren’t on the front lines yet, but heavy reserves in the north and a much stronger production base should see the units draped in black charging in soon.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Punching Up"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Sulu declare on Australia, trying to take advantage of their more powerful navy in the region. Though the Power Rankings gap is vast, this war is somewhat evenly matched… for now. Tech counts are even, and overall military is fairly even, but Sulu is densely packed and fielding Privateers while Australia is spread thin across the empire. So while they hold the advantage for now on the push for these islands, Whyalla already in the yellow, Australia’s more-than-double production will turn things around in due time.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "I’ll take you both on."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>The puppet master is revealed, as Seddon declares war on both of his most threatening neighbors, Australia and Papua. Likely responsible for dragging the Irrelevant Coalition into the Papua war, the Moors also join in. Seeing as it’s only Sulu and New Zealand against Australia, that could have been suggested by either party, but is mutually beneficial anyway, attacking the Aussie Empire from both sides. However, picking both fights at the same time may be too much on one plate.</p><p></p><p>Madagascar joins the Parthia warwagon...</p>"

  scene_title: "Deserted Desert"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>As do the Kazakhs. Sharing borders, they too could make gains like the Goths in this region, if they can divert some forces from erasing the Nenets. We’ll have to see who gets units to the area first.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "The Moops"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>A nice carpet in the Moors core, though north Africa is still looking a little sparse.</p><p></p><p>Korea and Shikoku make peace.</p>"

  scene_title: "Border Skirmish"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Frog Lake remains in the yellow, Dzilthdaklizhéndé recovers, and Cut Knife gets scratched by a wave of advancing Apache ranged units. This front is going to be a bloody grind.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Bergen Time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings take Bergen, and Prussia bombards the city to the black. Unfortunately, as we all know surrounding cities with ranged units like Galleasses? Galleaii? makes it rather difficult to capture, even with melee Galleons in range.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "ReJelleration"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene22.jpg

- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Privateer Party"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Sulu press onwards, Whyalla down to red and Newcastle down a quarter. Minimal Aussie reinforcements thus far.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Peacekeeper No More"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Madagascar’s joining of the coalition is not irrelevant, as their supposed ‘peacekeepers’ around Nizwa go hostile and chip away at the city. Were it not for Palmyra also playing peacekeeper and taking up space, this would be much more swift. But no, the populace will suffer for another turn or two before over half of them are wiped out.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Peace Out"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Manx get some relief as peace is brokered with the HRE, allowing them to focus on the Vikings. Port Erin still stands under the orange banner, though melee units are on approach.</p><p></p><p>Tonga and Uruguay, and the Golden Horde and Parthia also make peace.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Rev up the meatgrinder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Goths reach the front, but Parthia has summoned up a defense of mostly Crossbowmen only a step behind. Kazakh units trickle in from the north as they peace out a couple irrelevant wars with Palmyra and Nepal.</p><p></p><p>Over in North America, the Metis city of Frog Lake falls to the Apache.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Goth Backdoor Squad: Operation FADO"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Goths also get a division through the open borders with Muscovy, and begin to threaten Frankfurt An Der Oder.</p><p></p><p>Nizhny Novgorod is also the site of a large clash with Sami forces, which could go either way.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Shook"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nepal didn’t see that war as irrelevant, and give up a city in their Kazakh peace deal. If Ablai can get that production under control or get some troops over to the new exclave of Patan, it could serve as a great flanking base in an eventual war with the Khamug Khanate.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Masangone-o."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Masangano falls, pushing Ndongo further out of southern Africa, and a bunch of civilian units escape into the ocean. Next up for Zimbabwe, the capital, Kabasa.</p>"

  scene_title: "Eviction Notice"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nubia peaces out with Benin, freeing them up to redirect forces to the south into Ndongo, surrounding Kavanga and bringing the walls down. Nzinga’s core is crumbling, and she may be kicked off the mainland soon.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "An Exclave in either hand."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Two turns later, and the Parthian exclave of Nizwa falls as predicted. Madagascar’s foothold on the mainland grows, and with no more opposition in the area now is the time to eye a new target, keep the momentum going. India’s new holdings on the horn look sparse for now, but a land army makes their way across the sea from their core. Who will strike first?</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "You Were Not Prepared"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene33.jpg

- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "A Key Defense"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>A look at the now-at-peace Nubia-Benin borders show Nubia managed to retake Eko and barely held Ewohimi while Benin successfully defends Udo, protecting a major production center from crumbling and preserving their future opportunities.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Tongan Tropics"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Tongan core is looking a little empty, and all that water doesn’t provide much production to pump out units, but their military strength is quite high for their low Power Ranking. We’ve seen some rather large navy groups roaming about early last part, and with peace made with Uruguay a couple turns ago, I believe their sole remaining war is with the Sulu, likely sending that navy north around Papua.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Let Them In"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shikoku makes real progress since we last saw them, landing a significant army, thanks in part to open borders with the Qin, and with cannons set up Hangzhou is in very real danger of being flipped. The Qing navy lying in wait can easily retake it, but allowing cities to be decimated is not a winning strategy. </p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Not So Long Live The King"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’m honestly not sure what we’re seeing here, but I believe this is Calgary being founded anew upon its ashes, by that settler two tiles away that has appeared to have not moved yet, judging by the borders not appearing yet. The last of the Canadian army dissipates under Metis assault, and Windsor has almost finished burning, but WLMK refuses to give up… I don’t know what he expected from declaring this war.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Bergen Flipper"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings and Prussia have been playing hot potato with Bergen and it is reduced to a minimal population, but it appears Prussia may hold the territory as the remaining Viking melee units are scarce and several turns away.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Take Two"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sulu’s northern Australia campaign starts well, taking both Whyalla and Newcastle and running the Australian navy off. Taungoo thinks they have an opening and strike at Sulu with the meager forces stationed in their exclave of Bhamo, I believe those are Galleons and Ships of the Line unleashing upon the ports of Dungun and Geelong. Jamalul has enough Privateers nearby that this attack should be repelled, but we may see a city flip.</p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "The Walls Are Closing In"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Benin Advance continues. Kavanga falls and is set ablaze, and a small naval regiment softens up the offshore Mpungo A Ndongo, suggesting to Nzinga that she maybe seek her exile in one of her further-flung colonies.</p>"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: "Defend The North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Parthia summons a defensive force to fight its northern aggressors, but are far too late to save Zadracarta, surrounded by Kazakhs and in the yellow.</p><p></p><p>The fertile fields around Turkistan in the peaceful Kazakh core have allowed it to blossom to a massive 42 population.</p>"
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: "Something Will Happen Evenktually"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Evenks core and Khamug border. Both sides are a little light on melee units here, I count 7 Evenks to the Khanate’s 8, but several of those Evenks melee units are in the back lines. If war did break out here it would likely be a bloody ranged war with few city captures.</p><p></p><p>Looks like Taungoo brought some irrelevant friends to the Sulu war.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Papuanut Brain play"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>I guess Rajapapua really wanted those north aussie islands, because despite being engaged with New Zealand to the east, Papua joins Taungoo in this fight with a slightly technologically superior and manpower-ready Sulu to the west. This may be a critical overextension that has significant repercussions.</p>"
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: "No Chance"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well so much for an Antarctic colony escape for Nzinga, as Uruguay makes quick work of the tiny islands. Despite the losses, Nzinga can have a moment of respite as she begs for mercy from Benin and gets it.</p>"
- scene_number: 45
  scene_title: "Bhamo Battalion Burnout"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Geelong has flipped, and Dungun may do the same, but the Bhamo Battalion is running out of steam and will not make any permanent gains. Damage has been done, but now the question is can they hold on to Bhamo itself.</p><p></p><p>To the north we see some of the fighting along the border to the Taungoo mainland, where Sulu forces hold strong for now. Taungoo appears to be in the process of upgrading their Trebuchets to Cannons, while Sulu already field their UU Cannon, the Lantaka, en masse.</p>"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: "Papua Panic!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>Northeastern Papua is under heavy assault, not just from New Zealand from both the north and south, but determined to prove they can be relevant, Haida sends a navy contingent across the ocean, threatening both Vabukori and Elevala. Seddon’s push from the south has almost surrounded Boera and looks like it will succeed.</p><p></p><p>The sharpest of eyes and memory will notice that the Iroquois have founded a city of their own on the island two tiles east of Itsagahiti, which now used to have a Holy Site on it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zimbabwe advances. Kabasa crumbles. I see seven Ndongo melee units left, and as they die so do Nzinga’s chances of surviving. The Antarctic colonies are gone, will Uruguay come try to get an African foothold?</p><p></p><p>Songhai also joins the Parthian Irrelevant Coalition.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qing repel the Shikoku forces, and a capture of Hangzhou is now in doubt, despite the city being at 0 hp. The embarked Musketmen could land, but being unfortified in open terrain at two-thirds health, would likely be dead before they could act next turn. Will Cixi push back?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode19-scene50.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the southern Papua front, we see Boera taking another hit, and the mainland coastal city of Darwin also takes damage. Papua’s navy appears to be mostly Frigates, so that lack of melee ships may be an issue if anything flips. Y’know, aside from the loss of millions of lives from these massive cities.</p><p></p><p>New Zealand shows what is I believe the cylinder’s first Cruiser in the bottom center of this slide.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zadracarta is taken by the Kazakhs, but Parthia’s defenders have managed to prevent damage to other front line cities so far. Rhages specifically is a surprise, but the hills surrounding the city protect it from the Goth Crossbowmen on flat terrain behind it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh. It was a distraction. For an equally drunk declaration of war. Yeah, the western Zimbabwe core is a little sparse with all the fighting in the east, but Ranavalona forgot to move troops to the front before declaring war. So that advantage is gone. And that’s all you had.</p><p></p><p>A notification indicates Ndongo managed to retake their capital...</p>"

  narration: "<p>Does Ragnar have his shit together? I think Ragnar got his shit together. A well balanced navy escorting a land army makes its way north around the isles, taking Colby and thrashing Onchan, with plenty of steam to move onwards to Kirk Patrick and Ballasalla when he’s done.
