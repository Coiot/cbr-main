  narration: "<p>Welcome Lordies and Gentlewomen to the Sid Meier’s Civilisation Five Battle Royale Version X Part Thirty Starting At Turn 500. I’m your narrator today, Fiona Danger aka Lungora, here to infect your computer screen with words and/or possess our video narrator Dawkinzz’ body for the next thirty-ish minutes. You may know me as the primary creator of the map the current game is running on, a long term member of the community since the first planning of CBRMK1, or as a novice mod creator who has just now released her third one onto the workshop. I’ll be going into this part just as blind as you are so hold onto something as we dive into this latest part.</p>"

  narration: "<p>User ARedundantSofa on the subreddit blesses us with this amazing piece of OC this week, showing our favourite East Asian Storemonger about to call for the manager demanding larger cities than the ones she ordered and received from the poor Koreans, Evenks, and everyone else.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>As has become a tradition at this point we have Vihreaa’s stellar hand-drawn map. I must admit the last few parts always meld together into a mega-part in my head and so while I would otherwise point of the recent changes displayed I might accidentally tell you about a capture from part 25 and that would be embarrassing.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>Edse1991 on the subreddit has provided the most interesting map to be released this last week, showing all the positions that were settled, destroyed, settleable, and not as of the end of Part 28. It may be a week behind but the information is still incredibly great to see and valid for the upcoming part to happen.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>Last place in the alphabetical list, and first place in the power rankings again is Zimbabwe. They’re a powerhouse and their recent conquests in the Horn of Africa being integrated alongside catching up in tech behind Uruguay solidify them as the real top contender. </p>"

  scene_title: "Tanungoo doesn’t know Dawei"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We start this part with a shot of the ever present stalemate in the HImalayas as Taungoo continues to bombard Nuwakot down. I hate to be pesimistic but I don’t think this city is going to fall as long as they continue rushing artillery forward into the only two tiles they can get into as opposed to say maybe that landship.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Up in the Arctic, a glance of Metis spillover around Vorkuta and the Prussian colony of Elbling is shown. Someone reports seeing a little bit of smoke from the damage of something in the snow but that’s just hearsay.</p>"

  scene_title: "Indian Update"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the North, Indian cities are bombarded by what appear to be Khamug planes, though between peacekeepers and mountains nothing will happen besides potential temptation for an eventual nuking. In the south Bhaktapur is solidly in the black, but so are the chances of anyone at war with Nepal from taking this juicy prize until enough ranged units are slaughtered. Or maybe one will get lucky and have a melee unit on the front lines.</p>"

  scene_title: "*DABats on Benin*"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>As far as the mysterious notes on the side of the narration slides tell me, Benin is engaged in conflict with the now extremely fragmented and rumpy Beta Israel. Long from its days of being a chad, the civ that actually owns the lake would be in a good position to take one of Gudit’s last cities from her if not for Zimbabwe taking on a new lifestyle protecting rather than eating their Ethiopian neighbours.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our screenshotters provide us with an image of Uruguay’s island across the Pacific. Much more interesting is the Benin battleship to its west who seems to have invented anti-gravity engines. Unfortunately they don’t know how to keep their ship upright when activated. I hope the two planes aboard are strapped down.</p>"

  scene_title: "All eyes on the Bermuda triangle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>More to the north end of the Pacific we see Porlamar, and many many Prussian immigrants heading across the sea to the new world of peacekeeping. Uruguay has a few future worlds drones(?) in the sea but as long as that displaced Gothic machine gunner is in the city they’re just going to have to float around being bombarded.</p>"

  scene_title: "Norwest Just Passing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Both Saint-Paul Des Metis and Port Pitt are reconquered by the Metis after having lost them in the last war. Their armies stream northward and some even use the congested territory of the Haida to make other inroads into Yupik lands. Saint-Paul will likely flip once from the Ice Sheet Fleet but with all those Paratroopers around I think it’s captured for good once that happens.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Peace on Earth, or at least Louisiana."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Venezuela's Generals are having a bad day. Despite previously made inroads, the Apache tenaciously hold on and reconquer both Jaketown and Tsokanende. There’s troops for the Carribean power to keep the war going, but much like the Iroquois front, peacekeepers are streaming in fast and it’s only going to be a matter of turns before this end of the Apache empire becomes impenetrable as well.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "One man army"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shikoku’s on a roll, or at least an Air Force kick. Somehow, by the Grace of G-d and the tactical genius of Sakamoto Ryoma, a lone paratrooper drops into the wilderness around the Evenki city of Taimura and under the cover of night takes the city all on their own. Holding it might be difficult without backup but I can see at least one more droppy boi ready to reinforce.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Nuku’Alive-fa, just."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Seddon pushes his navy forward, creating a solid front of mixed ships and embarked troops to the north around Vaini, but also sends a second prong to attack the Tonga capital. Two destroyers flank the city, one firing as the image is shot, and a pair of cruisers and a nuclear sub look to bring up the rear and confirm this kill.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Ham(hmam) is not Kos(h)er"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>With Koser firmly in his navy’s grasp the Warlord of the Southern Seas pushes harder on the now-exclave of Hamhmam. Local Selk’nam cultists offer sacrifice upon sacrifice to their eldritch gods to save them, but the only infinite power of destruction in these seas is Seddon.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Sulomay flip in a turn"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sneaking past the walls of watching Uruguyans (literally) and Metis, Ablai Khan strikes against Sulomay, bringing it under his control. The city isn't worth much being all snow and ice and surrounded in units ambivalent to the war, but it’s another capture on the list in the slow decline of the Evenk’s empire.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Battle of Kamchatka"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>“Damn son” was what I said to myself as I flipped onto this slide. Shikoku is doing work. Sure they’ve got a strong tech lead and sure the Evenks are pressured on multiple fronts with as many great people as military units in this slide, but I figured it’d take a couple of turns, not just one, for Ryoma to send these power armoured infantry north and take the next city on the list. At this speed I’m now expecting every Evenki city visible to be taken by the end of the part and with PAI already engaging Kislokan, and Miryuga in the black, I’m betting on it.</p>"

  scene_title: "ronks"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah Nishapur. This city whose owner, (thanks to me being informed by OC that didn't quite make it into this part) is climbing the rankings simply because it’s not valuable enough to eliminate.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Pirates of the Indian Ocean"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’m… not entirely sure who’s attacking Gudit’s privateers in this image. Benin? Taungoo? Maratha disliking all the piracy going on? Eitherway this shot shows some awesome potential. I’d love to see if Maratha wants to have a proper boat fight with Madagascar. </p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Khamugs? Fighting?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Boy is this a surprise. Jamukha actually having to use his armies for something. Leaping into Shikoku Manchuria have appeared a small army of India’s unique Garuda Troopers. These lads heal up when next to each other in enemy territory so if Indira could get several times this amount in place she could really give any civ on the cylinder a run for their money at least briefly.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Seddon fire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>This just in: Vaini burns. Its citizens flee to the quarries and plantations in the surrounding countryside as NZ troops commit unspeakable horrors within the streets. Will the unit of heroic paratroopers save the city? Time will only tell.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "A cthulook into our favourite cultists"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Man, the Selk’nam are getting pretty small over here. Losing their entire west coast is a huge blow throwing them, imho, into the bottom rungs of the game - and for Seddon having his trans-Pacific empire is really an achievement. Hamhmam just offscreen to the north doesn’t look to have flipped yet so at least there’s a distraction before the Kiwi fleets swing around the Drake Passage to finish their foes off properly.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "World Taungress"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah it’s nice to have a break from all these wars, and see some diplomacy for once. All the nations of the world getting together to sit down, have a nice chat, and otherwise be civil. Except that’s not what they’re doing at all. This is another battlefield and if anything it may be more bloody than the outside world. Bayinnaung is throwing around his diplomatic weight, leading the civs into condemnation of Seddon. Something about all of that warmongering gives me the feeling it will be well received (Dawkinzz - Because everyone actually loves Selk’nam). And Louis Riel has come up behind Abdelkader and shoved the man off the podium to propose his own embargo of the Moors. I don’t think either of these civs deserve it. What did they ever do to the Metis?</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Bermuda tries"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>More Prussians, more Uruguyans, more Iroquois, more Rockets, and the Goths are still preventing anything actually happening in Porlamar. Jesus christ that’s a lot of Prussians.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Korean Metis"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Does anyone else instinctively think “I thought Korea was dead but they have all these units” whenever they see the extensive Metis carpets in Kazakhstan? No? Just me? Despite them, Ablai Khan continues to push his offensive, working with Shikoku on the other side of the sleeping Mongol to hemorrhage cities from Bombogor’s Evenk empire. Vanavara is the latest in this attack to be taken as city by city, the Kazakhs make way towards the deer-lovers’ capital.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "It’s ORCwantke"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Following what I believe to be another flip of Orukwantke, Seddon pulls his warmonger cap on tighter and decides, “if his empire’s going to be embargoed what’s the point in not burning everything to the ground?” I feel for the city, as I’m also a victim of savagery on things I love that are currently called Oruk. My poor Orcs and Goblins. GW why did you have to butcher them so? Sorry got out of hand there. Tl;dr Seddon is a barbarian.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Slingshot"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Back up north we slingshot to the Evenki “empire”. Power armoured Shikokans march forward into Kislokan, taking the city in a race inland. Tamura is threatened with the paratrooper that had taken it being among the casualties of this war. But I have faith in Shikoku’s Air Force to eliminate the infantry ready to capture here before it can truly move in. Note the turns, the slides are going at a slow pace due to everything happening worldwide and at this speed of conquest Miryuga maybe has two left.</p>"

  scene_title: "O Valley of Prussians"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Big news! The Prussian newspapers (and armies) are going to have a field day following this one. My informants report that the Prussian empire has declared war on the Holy Roman empire. Brno may have had a good run as a refugee colony to hide away somewhere no one cared about for a while but even the mountains that somewhat wall it off aren’t going to help now. Prime your Fs, because this won't take long, the Elected Emperor only has six enlightenment era units to defend against the modern onslaught.</p>"

  scene_title: "Golden Age"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’d say this is appropriate. We’ve got entertaining wars, with real conquests, and big carpets to watch crush each other for our amusement. A golden age it really is here on the sub. </p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Backfired, a bit like the city."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The ruined husk of Orukwantke seems to have invigorated the Selk'nam people into a counter offensive. Perhaps this was the sacrifice the elder gods above and below needed? Will burning more cities further their influence on this world? One can only hope when the nuclear fires of the wars of the future arrive. The Selk'nam people and their eldritch masters are empowered on a scale one has never seen before. Or not, I haven’t read anything like that in their UA.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Murri Musketman"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Garuda Troopers push too slowly and too unsuccessfully out of Shikoku Manchuria and fail to make any real ground towards Daegu. This was expected, but that’s okay. Looking closer we can really see just how behind Jamukha’s forces have become. Khamug line infantry and cavalry stand next to mechanised infantry and SAM units right across the border in Qin lands. As the creator of the Khamug-Mongols I’ve been waiting since the very start for them to do something big and an invasion of China has always topped the wishlist. But if they were to do it now I’m honestly not certain they’d find a lot of success with this army of troops that sincerely belong in a museum. </p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Icefantry"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>When we last saw this scene I made a prediction that the Ice Sheet Fleet would flip Saint-Paul Des Metis. I was thinking a boat of some sort, because it’s surrounded by water and there’s boats. Not a sneaky infantryman abusing his ability to sneak through ice tiles over the sea past the massing Metis horde. And there’s a second one ready to do it all again once this inevitable failure eventually is seen to its conclusion.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "‘UwUiha what’s this?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh right, the other Tongan war. The other Tongan war with the Nazca. The other Tongan war with the Nazca that they are also losing. Tongoleleka is captured by not a navy, and proceeds to be set on fire. There’s a lot of water around so maybe they’ll be fine, but I doubt it. ‘Uiha’s next and with those future worlds ships around it I’ll let you make your own guesses on the outcome. Sioasi must be feeling as much regret about these wars as his creator, Explosive Watermelon, feels about the CBRX state of the civ.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Insert witty naval pun"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Well it seems those “heroic” paratroopers I placed faith in earlier just sat down and ate sugar while all the war around them took place, but at least someone stopped the burning of Vaini. Seddon seems to have misplaced the majority of his navy around here too. Maybe they’re down south taking the capital? </p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Papuan Scout is cold. The End."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>This isn't the shot proving Seddon knows how to fight naval wars good, but it’s another look into the northern reaches of the Cylinder where as far as I can tell nothing is happening. Maybe they’re expecting me to make up a short narrative story about the freezing Papuan scout that has found himself on the edge of the world. Not today Blue Cassette you aren’t my real dad.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Behind the screen of peacekeepers"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Maybe it’s my sleep deprivation, or the fact that I’m here mentally prepping a DnD session at the same time as typing this up, or I’m just seeing things, but as much as I appreciate more glamour shots of the sexy sexy Khamug empire I’m seeing a whole load of nothing new. Maybe that’s the point though? The Himalayas with all this bordergore are the most stalematey of stalematey.</p>"

  scene_title: "aDRESSing the Goth problem"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>I guess Hiawatha really liked the HRE, because he’s expelled every last Prussian from his borders. These blue and black (Or are they white and gold?) soldiers’ vacations are over there’s a war to win and so back across the Pacific they sail. Update on Porlamar: the Gothic machine gunner still owns the place. If I were Lavalleja I’d be frothing at the mouth ngl. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mmmmhm roasted Ham. Or Hamhmam rather which is pretty much the same letters but the result of me trying to type on discord while barely coherent at four in the morning.The Selk'nam, short of a ninja peace deal, were never going to hold onto this deliciously honey-mustard basted city but it’s newsworthy all the same. Someone fetch the apple sauce.</p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "Porlamachinegun"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>I don’t know how he did it but the madlad managed to convince the Gothic Machine gunner to rightly fuck off and let the city be captured. Porlamar is FINALLY in Uruguayan hands and while I’m an Iroquois fan at heart this is refreshing as heck to see. Now that he controls the mystical powers of the Bermuda triangle will the fears of Uruguay being unstoppable from earlier in the game come true? Or might he just have a lot more boats and planes go missing?</p>"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: "This Tsucksanende"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oof. So after those initial flips back to Apache control the stranglehold of peacekeepers has been so severe the Venezuelans have found no more room to push into North America. The expelling of Prussians has done nothing for the Iroquoian front either as too many foreign nationals stand in the way of what at one point was the most exciting war in this battle royale. Also, New Zealand and Tonga make peace. It’s a thing. My eyesight isn't good enough to squint at the minimap and determine exactly how much was handed over so let's hope we see soon.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>Insert slide fourteen text here. Maratha did shake some little things up at least by citadelling India even harder in the Kanpur, and Merv is fully healed and healthy ready for an annexation but that’s about it friends. Nisapur needs pop at 20. It’s for the church honey. NEXT.</p>"

  scene_title: "Vainot anymore"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, here we are, the shot of our two seafaring scufflers. Ending their friendly tussle it seems Vaini disappeared somewhere in peacemaking, and Kolovai and Hihifo were set alight. Palmerston North has after an entire game been returned to their founders. While the shipposter in me is happy that Tonga Time will continue for now, look how close Seddon was to taking Siaosi’s capital! I guess Australia is making it impossible for now but that’s no reason to give up just one or two turns too early.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tongas rush a fleet around the north to save Tongoleleka which is burning steadily down to ashes. Hihifo’s citizens will have none of the same hope. ‘Uiha bombards a Nazcan vessel while hastily healing its garrison and rebuilding holes in the walls, only able to do such because Nazca seems to have lost any of the melee ships it might have had. With the Tongan navy barely existing this should really be a cakewalk.</p>"

  scene_title: "More like Des-Mountains"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>There was nearly a complete ring of peacekeepers from east Asia around Port Des-Prairies last time we saw the city, but following what appears to be a flip they seem to have been utterly expelled and the city is surrounded with freshly dropped paratroopers. There’s no more sneaky ice infantry to save the day here either, which is nice. Except the one in Fort Des-Praires I guess.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode30-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>And we’re back to the shouting match also known as the World Congress! Seddon’s show of force sees him become exiled from world trade, which will likely send the already war-mad man spirally further now that his economy will have to be built solely around looting and pillaging of foreign lands. The civ that honestly didn't deserve it, the Moors, are also embargoed, for no good reason, by the Metis. This round is far more cooperative with not only a proposal for the world to get together for some healthy sports competition, but to discuss how to best send their peacekeepers to the asteroid belts as well. Fun stuff!</p>"

  narration: "<p>And much like my Christmas Eve dinner was, the roasted Ham of the cylinder has been completely devoured. This opens up maybe even some potential settles of which only Uruguay can really take any real advantage of. That’s a really big Shikokan carrier by the way. Damn son!</p>"

  narration: "<p>I have to admit I was waiting for this slide. One showing off the beautiful orange-red and yellow colours of the CBRX Vikings. Colours that I in fact proposed. See when the CBRX was finished voting and colour changes were being proposed the bright purple of the Vikings civ that had been selected was simply too similar to the Nenets, especially when in some of the test games the two even had touching borders. A solution was needed and I had just started work of a civ of my own starting in Nidaros as the Vikings do, featuring vikings to boot: Olaf II’s Norway. I proposed using the colours I had chosen for them taken from Trondheim’s (modern day Nidaros) flag. Well almost a year later my mod is finally complete and with the help of the community and some fabulous specific individuals, published on steam for all to see. With my shilling out of the way we get a good look at Norse Scotland, and the new Communication Array and Generator improvements they are covering the countryside.

Prussians are trying to get home I feel for them but the rest of everyone here from Nazca to Kongo to Zimbabwe to the Goths to Tonga to Haida, to fricken Poverty fucking Point are just chillin’ making this tough. Of note the Moors declare war on the HRE.</p>"

Tofoa falls as the Nazca transport a paratrooper over by sea to take it and seem to be doing similar with a SAM in the waters around ‘Uiha. Poor Tonga, this part is really not their time.</p>"

I hope they succeed here if they are because Tarko-Sale has been around a little too long and gaining far too much attention for a city that doesn’t exist. The Kazakhs to the south build the newest Wonder of the World: The Kalt Geymsia Data Haven. This thing is like a late game tundra petra, but one that spams you with science and culture as well as +2 gold for every single Server Hub building in the empire.</p>"

Units all get some dope Gengineered promotion which the secret part notes decline to say what it does, and Fungal Growths now appear randomly on farms, plantations, nature preserves, and unimproved tiles in addition to where they solely spawned previously which was between your toes after visiting a public pool’s changing rooms. Fungal Growths are afaik a mostly defensive improvement and they’re pretty good at it, but not quite as good as a Goth Peacekeeper carpet. </p><p></p><p>I’m also told we see “Iro Automatons” where I’m taking a guess are the sun icon guys in Hiawatha’s lands. These are cheap, fast, flanking units that are pretty damn mean. Also somehow Jaketown is captured. Venzualan fans rejoice!</p>"

Hiawatha pulls up second, with twice the production given as the next two in Ablai and Eadni. Overall fun is had by all and maybe if we did this more often we won’t have a need for war.

Hiawatha wins this one properly, giving in my opinion a much better reward compared to the last competition. Some may say space is the limit, but they’d be wrong and this proves that. Peacekeeper carpets are the real limit. </p>"

  narration: "<p>A Muscovite Musician sometimes has to journey to the ends of the earth for their next big piece. Its artwork, and master artwork at that. It needs masterful adventure to inspire it. And such with his pke-armed comrades the musician has arrived in Svalbard. The coldest most northern region of the world he could ever imagine. To find his inspiration, to make his song. To awe the entire world with his music. If only he could leave. These Sami are rather insistent on a closed border to him and it’s been a very long time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I guess Drake’s Passage was too difficult to sail around. Probably all the Uruguayan drones in the way. So the Kiwis march over land, or fly then drop more likely, into the outskirts of Kawaiyen. It’s a cute attempt, just like the city name, and will require more reinforcement to get done. Seddon is on a warpath and knows this. These are just the first waves to be sent to die. Also the Forbidden Palace is finally built, expect more Iroquois in the World Congress.</p>"

They just started a war. Taungoo is looking to spread it’s oozey self all over Indira and not in the kinky way.

  narration: "<p>I think this is the place for a eulogy. The last valid Muscovite melee troop is a rifleman stuck on the other side of a Sami power armoured infantry. Ivan did… poorly. He settled cities in a straight line never building a real core around his capital and as politics heated up he was unable to hang on anywhere but his capital itself for very long. Lucky peace deals and peacekeepers as well as Sami allergies to melee saved him for a long time but it was not enough to last til Endgame. RIP Ivan.</p>"

Here we see the most likely landing points where the notorious and ruthless Manx navy, army, and Air Force is likely to land first. It’s navy is nothing to the mighty Manx privateer carpet, and it’s forces are consisting mostly of recon and support units. </p><p>Okay so, that’s not actually the case at all. The war’s the other way around. And if the Uruguyans can push through the Atlantic garbage patch we might be seeing a Hispanic Britain. Or not, the AI does like to make pointless wars.

  narration: "<p>Back to the talking board. Today’s United Nations (I may have been calling it the World Congress whoops) has the world deciding on some new ideas. Louis is considering Venezuela a menace, and that’s a fair argument they’re conquering cities that he wants. On the other hand this would empower Venezuela’s neighbours somewhat giving Uruguay even more ability to stomp them into the earth when Lavalleja gets around to it. Bayinnaung on the other hand might have got a few glimpses of the cheatsy Biogeneered Uruguayan athletes from the World Games, and has proposed evening the playing field internationally. A solid pick.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brno is gone. The HRE have no melee units left. Prussians have taken the city and vassalised its people. And I feel utterly unqualified to make a good eulogy here. I’ve never been much of a fan of the HRE, I really dislike the design and never wanted them in the CBRX in the first place and so I don’t think it’s a surprise when early I wanted to use their leader name I had to default to Elected Emperor as I don’t and still don’t even recall which one they currently (or I guess previously being dead) have. They um, were a good boxing bag for all the better civs in Europe. Their legacy continues as the source of allowing Venice and Vikings to be solid mid tier civilisations via captured cities. If you feel this is unsatisfactory I’m sorry, but we have a subreddit where a much better eulogy can be made. RIP Elected Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Also, Uruguay makes another wonder.

Sakamoto Ryoma constructs the Mnemosyne Facility that fast levels units built in the city it was constructed with xp equal to 10x the highest level unit in the empire.

If the Haida are at war they’re in a good spot to take it, if they’re not they’re in a good spot to defend it because the Apache just declared war on Monty. The Apache have nearly no visible ground troops in this shot, and if they had them it wouldn’t really matter considering the peacekeeper spam going on. What they do have is a navy, and Haida has the ability to leave into both Apache and Venezuela waters. So the moment an opening appears, the Aztecs would be gone for good.</p>"

We never got to see that Taungoo versus India showdown so I hope nothing important happened while our eyes were elsewhere and all will be revealed in both the full turn videos as well as next part. I’ve been your narrator Fiona Danger, and I won’t see you next time but I’ll certainly be beside you watching the next installment unfold. And just like the Nenets seen on screen nothing after this exists.</p>"
