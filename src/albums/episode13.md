  narration: "<p>Welcome again to the /r/civbattleroyale, CBRX (Seabricks) edition! I am /u/TechnostarBTD5, two-time former narrator, resident power-ranker, and this universe’s closest equivalent to Miles Dyson. I’ll be your host for these next 15 turns, as we venture forth from the submarine to explore the cylinder in this time of chaos. Last episode saw the elimination of the Minoans, but will we see another civ reduced to a footnote in history this time around? Only time will tell!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our OC today comes from /u/AlbinosRideDinos, showcasing the bad luck of one particular city. London, originally a Canadian city in Newfoundland, has gone through four separate owners in the span of just a single episode. For the poor souls of London, this has meant learning a new language every few decades as each successive administration attempts to enforce their cultural norms upon the city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our community-made map today is courtesy of /u/Vihreaa, who has a knack for getting these things out extremely early. I rely heavily on the state of the map for my power rankings, so I am very grateful for this cartographic achievement. On this map, we can see a world of chaos in two separate regions: the Russian Far East, which was the site of a recent Haida conquest, and the Labrador Peninsula, which is the site of several still-active wars.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our second map comes from /u/ThyReformer, a fellow power ranker. The Subjectively Pretty diagram of Objectively Relevant wars (SPOR for short) is an incredibly useful tool for getting a quick overview of modern geopolitics. Many of these wars here are likely to get a lot of screen time, so keep an eye out for these conflicts.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I don’t even have to look at this slide to know who sits at the top of the charts for yet another episode. I can sense those eyes anywhere. Those eyes stare straight into my soul and haunt my nightmares, judging me with contempt for my misdeeds. But I smile back. Lavalleja, you may feel comfortable and smug for now, but how can you rest easy when you send your soldiers to die in the jungles of ‘Kuro? I hope that hubris eventually catches up to you like it caught up to me.</p>"

JFD provides the abstract of this month's content: “In this tenth issue, we focus on the brief modding period spent focusing on Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth. We also speak with Gedemon about the woes and frustrations of being a veteran Civ VI modder. And not to be outdone by Civ VI, some of Civ V's modders present their thoughts on a hypothetical third expansion for Civ V. Enjoy laddies.”</p>"

  scene_title: "Blue Walls and Blue Roads"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not even an Eldritch Horror would dare challenge the might of the Uruguayan military. Not in this day and age. Consequently, the Selk’nam have been forced to exchange one blue route for another, taking to the sea in their quest to escape the southern cone. Unfortunately, these ambitions are met with deadlock, not conquest. The Nazca have a strong navy of their own, and with only a two-tile stretch of coastal waters to navigate through, the Nazca have managed to erect a solid defense and cut their losses to just the desert city of Ocongalla. In due time, these South Americans will discover the uninhabited islands that lay off their shores, but until they learn to let the stars guide them, the great blue sea shall remain just a narrow road along the shoreline.</p>"

  scene_title: "Not a Beta Anymore"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a bold show of strength, Beta Israel has flipped Resafa once more while continuing their campaign in Heliopolis and off the coast of Callinicum. Resafa has sustained several flips in recent turns, having ended turn 185 in the hands of Palmyra. Nevertheless, I see this as a massive embarrassment for Palmyra, as while the city may flip a few more times, Beta Israel’s strong presence in the area means that Palmyra’s chances of holding this city by the end of this war are slim, barring any poorly-timed peace deals.</p><p></p><p>In other news, Libya has become the target of a joint declaration of war by the Moors and the Songhai. Such a move by the Moors would have been bold just a few turns prior, but with Algeria nearing death’s door, the rationality behind this decision is clear.</p>"

  scene_title: "Gulf War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of poor peace deals, the aftermath of one is having an interesting effect in one of the cylinder’s many conflicts. The city of Nizwa, initially given away to Parthia by Oman, has become the site of a Seljuq amphibious operation, as a series of four units plus a worker attempts to lay siege to the city. I have to give credit to Parthia for accepting that ancient peace deal, as this distraction means that Parthia’s main military has 4 fewer Seljuq units to deal with.Underneath the minimap, we can vaguely see that the 7-population Omani city of Rustaq is still in the red from Maratha’s efforts. In our timeline, Oman controlled a large stretch of coastline stretching south far enough that their sultan chose to live in Zanzibar, but in this world, it’s the Marathi who aim for this sort of coastal hegemony.</p>"

  scene_title: "Suluspam Fizzles Out"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>What was once a mighty invasion force has been reduced to mere skirmishes as Australia’s navy finally starts acting like the defensive powerhouse we saw in Mk. 2. For any Sulu supporters, this image is not a promising sight, as Jamalul only has some scattered ranged units near the besieged city of Geelong, while their melee units lie much farther to the east. Sulu’s primary advantage this game has been their technological prowess and their large navy, but both of these advantages have now eroded away. The residents of Bhamo laugh at this sight, confident in their decision to build their home inland and away from this naval nonsense. </p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Tasman Teardown"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Sulu threat may have faded for now, Australia still faces one more enemy: New Zealand. While not overwhelming in size, the Kiwi invasion force still outnumbers the Australian defenders and has already brought the Tasmanian city of Queanbeyan to half health. Will we see a Kiwi Tasmania once more like what we saw in Mk. 2? Only time will tell. But if there’s one thing I can say with confidence, it’s that this ancient ANZAC rivalry transcends timelines. To the north, the Murri look on with delight at this development, as an overexpanded Australia is perhaps their only hope at regaining relevance.</p>"

  scene_title: "Axes Attack"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the cold reaches of northern Quebec, the Iroquois invasion of Canada continues in full fervor. The lumberjacks have evidently run out of good trees to chop, so they have resorted to hacking at what’s left of Calgary’s walls. Given the sheer number of melee units nearby, it’s only a matter of time before Calgary falls, leaving only a few vaguely Canadian cities left to carry King’s banner. As I worked on some of the code for Canada’s unique components, it pains me to know that they are unlikely to see the light of day. Lavalleja knows this and smiles in amusement at my strife. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere in the slide, the Apache citizens of Ch’ilwozh breathe a sigh of relief that they don’t have to face the woodsmen just yet. Conversely, the citizens of Port Erin worry that they may need to learn this new language of “Spanish” that the temporary governor of London spoke of prior to fleeing the city. Just a few triremes could net Venezuela a second far-flung colony.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Re-re-reconquista"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Over in the lands known as Spain in our timeline, the language of “Spanish” must sound just as foreign to the residents there as it does to the citizens of Port Erin. But such linguistic tomfoolery is not on the minds of the North African population. Annaba, one of Algeria’s last 3 cities, is under siege by a coordinated effort of the Moorish army and navy. And unlike many failed invasions of the past, the Moors have actually brought a few melee units with them. It could be very soon that Algeria is reduced to just a city or two, giving the Moors the freedom to focus on the Lybian campaign in the east. In a classic Algerian move, they’ve prepared a settler, ready to forward-settle their neighbors yet again. Unfortunately for the few Algerian military strategists who have not been executed by the Moors, such a tactic is unlikely to work again, as no lands remain in the area for Algeria to settle.</p>"

  scene_title: "Darkness Simmers"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Down in the Southern Cone, we get a clear shot of the Selk’nam realm. They field an impressive military, both in army, navy, and land units that think they are ships. Unfortunately, the Uruguayan military around Paysandu has achieved a comparable unit density, something that wasn’t the case several episodes ago. The Selk’nam must look for other realms to invade if they want to grow their numbers, but to do so, they must first teach their boats to fear the sea as little as the pikeman south of Honhpaxten does.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Chukchi Chaos"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Departing from one of the more orderly but otherworldly peninsulas on the cylinder, we instead encounter the Chukchi Peninsula, complete with one of the most glorious examples of border gore present at this time. But of these diverse nations, only the Haida have a firm grasp on their peninsular holdings. For everyone else here, their territories are nothing more than far-flung holdings, as the Qing learned recently with the loss of Fuzhou. Nonetheless, barring a Korean attempt to connect their northern colony to their main holdings, the sparsity of land units in the region and the rough terrain means that most cities are secure for now.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Viking Legacy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>For a naval war against two well-fortified cities, the Viking siege of Scotland is progressing more than expected. Granted, expectations were never high in the first place, so seeing both of Scotland’s cities in the yellow is a cause for excitement. While I’ve been concerned about the fates of Canada and Algeria for a while now, perhaps I should seriously consider adding the Scots to my watchlist of dying civilizations. While the Vikings may be cut off to the East by the Sami and Prussia, a successful capture of Stirling and/or Edinburgh would have huge benefits for their seafaring culture, hopefully giving Ragnar the motivation to pursue more aggressive measures than mere coastal raids.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Colonial Colonization"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turning our eyes to the Caribbean, we see a slew of nations attempting to grab the last few remaining islands before this particular frontier closes. Uruguay, the Kuikuro, and the Iroquois seem content with their current holdings in the region, but Haiti and Venezuela both have ambitions to squeeze in one last city. Poverty Point, too, has joined the fray, sending two units to block off one of the Bahaman Islands. This leaves just one spot left for Haiti and Venezuela to compete for. I’d bet on Venezuela due to their naval presence in the region, but Haiti is not blocked out completely. And given that the Venezuelan navy is likely headed to reinforce their Newfoundland holdings, it is possible that they could pass this island by.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, this particular island was recently devastated by one of the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricanes on record.

  scene_title: "Punching Above Their Weight"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Beta Israel continues to inexplicably hold their own.. The terrain around Balankab may be burning, but the city’s valiant defenders successfully kept Zimbabwe from taking the city. Good terrain can really prove decisive at this stage in the game, and Beta Israel certainly knows how to make use of it. Even more impressively, the Beta Israeli navy has exploited the chokepoint created by Zimbabwe’s borders, keeping Madagascar’s units at bay with just a relatively small collection of triremes. </p>"

  scene_title: "If Only The City Populations Were 6 6 6"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s the 13th slide of the 13th episode, so naturally, we focus on a civ whose luck has not been stellar. Fortune has not been on Oman’s side this game, as they’re stuck with some of the worst stats on the cylinder. At the very least, Oman is not under an existential threat, as the Marathi invasion probably cannot hold Rustaq due to the sheer number of rustic (bad pun, I know) spearmen around the city. Elsewhere, the Seljuq invasion of Nizwa flounders and the Beta Israeli assault on Heliopolis has yet to take out the strategic citadel guarding the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Devil Down Under"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Australia has scrambled a fleet of its most recent warships to defend Tasmania, but it appears likely to arrive a turn too late. New Zealand has already reduced the city to a sliver of HP. A change in colors is likely in this city’s immediate future, and I don’t see Australia being able to recapture Queanbeyan in any reasonable amount of time. The Murri triremes look on in interest, eager to study anything that might give them an edge over the Aussies.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Wall of Shame"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>I stand by the title for this slide, although an alternate title would be “Wars the Goths Should Have Won”. Aside from the Parthians (being too far for any relevant wars to break out), the Goths have somehow managed to embarrass themselves in war with every civilization with cities on this slide. Even the Sami, who merely have a single unit in Muscovite territory, have taken steps simply to ridicule the Goths. And now, a civ that once boasted a reasonably strong military is suddenly looking worse for wear. What should be close to a carpet is now barely a third covered, indicating how much the Goths have wasted on their strategy of attacking every enemy city at once. Disregarding my contempt with Gothic tactics, the Golden Horde has surprisingly managed to wield a nice carpet. It’s a shame they don’t have more cities to hold their units in.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "time… tonga..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>With so many regions of the world embroiled in war, it is easy to forget that some cultures have only vague experiences with the concept. Tonga, in particular, is one such civ. Palmerston North, their only real conquest, was barely a war and has still not even been properly integrated into the Tongan dominion. Now that no foreign cities exist in Tongan territory, this peaceful paradise is one of the few sanctuaries left in the cylinder, and its crowded cities reflect its role as a safe haven for many refugees who somehow found their way aboard a seaworthy vessel.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Blanco Revolt"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>For those of you who haven’t been keeping track, the Colorados are currently in power in Uruguay, meaning that the extreme military production of Blancos rule has been sidelined for the time being. Clearly, the Colorado failure to resolve the war in ‘Kuro has been met with unrest, as a group of pikeman mercenaries has revolted near Montevideo. This unhappiness has two consequences. First, it just about guarantees a speedy transition back to Blancos rule once the Colorados have been in power for 30 turns, meaning that the cylinder’s largest military will once again be growing stronger quickly. Second, and perhaps more impactfully, it means that Uruguay is likely to raze any city it captures from the Kuikuro, if it captures any at all. </p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "ANZAC No More"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>And with that, Queanbeyan falls, leaving Australia with one less city to call their own! The Murri triremes can only watch in envy as the New Zealand flag is hoisted over the city. But with this, it’s likely that the New Zealand invasion will stagnate. Canberra is safely inland, while there are enough units around Adelaide to fend off the few boats that have made their way to the port.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Fortified Borders"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>This land may not be the site of any active military conflicts, but that does not mean it is free from any strife. In this case, that strife has manifested itself in the form of 6 whole citadels near Poverty Point’s borders, eating away at the rump state’s land a few tiles at a time. One Iroquois citadel has even managed to snag an Effigy Mound, the Poverty Point unique improvement that can only be constructed by a great person once per era.  </p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "A Missing Military"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Traveling to one of the most fertile stretches of land in Central Asia, we find a surprising lack of one thing: Units. It seems that Ablai Khan has spent all his might in the war against the Evenks, leaving his core surprisingly open to any potential invaders. That being said, none of the other nations present on this slide fields enough of a military to truly threaten the Kazakh core, sparse in units as it is. Instead, both the Kazakhs and the Goths have resorted to harassing the Nenets, albeit in different ways. The Kazakhs have formed a citadel chain to Nyar’yana Marq in an attempt to prove the existence of that city, while the Goths are actually at war with the hidden people. The 1000 residents of Yardoslavl’ sit in the sidelines and watch, grateful that the Goths somehow failed to capture its snowy streets.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Haida and Seek"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Aztecs may want to rethink their Oregon expedition. The Haida, with the words of encouragement of a certain horror from the south, have launched an invasion of the far-flung Aztec colony. With their naval unique unit, the Haida have recently become a force to be reckoned with, as they have successfully conquered cities from the Qing and Yup’ik and are likely to do the same to the Aztecs. Last I checked, the Metis are also at war with the Aztecs, although the distance between them and the sparsity of Metis units in the area means that a city snipe is unlikely.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Northern Lights"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>For the residents of Port Erin, today has not been their lucky day. Not only are they forced to learn a new language, but they also must deal with an incursion of refugees from the burning city of Port St. Mary. The remnants of Canada look at this bloodshed in fear, as they know that their cities could easily be next. The Metis settlers in the region look at the chaos and laugh. Their only goal is to claim more of the far north for their already-massive empire, and the decline of the Manx in the region means one less colonizer to worry about.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Scorched Earth"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Turning our eyes to the Mediterranean, we are greeted with some bad news for both the Moors and Algeria. Annaba has been set ablaze in an attempt to set an example for the other Algerian cities in the region. With only two remaining cities, this capture represents a major blow to the last bits of Algeria. However, it is also indicative of a major problem for the Moors as well. If the Moors needed to burn the city to quell unrest, it means their empire is struggling with happiness and therefore likely to raze any additional cities they conquer, be it from Libya or Algeria. Elsewhere in the slide, the Libyan city of Benghazi appears to be struggling, as the Songhai invasion has brought the city’s health to yellow. The Venetian navy observes this situation calmly, looking for the perfect opportunity to snag some more trading outposts.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Palmyra Pillaged"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Back in the Red Sea, the narrow waterway is living up to its name as the Beta Israel-Palmyra conflict continues in earnest. Resafa has been flipped once more as neither side can establish superiority in the region. To the southeast, Beta Israel has completed an important step in the conquest of Palmyra: the pillaging of the Heliopolis citadel. By clearing this citadel, Beta Israel now places Heliopolis in a far more vulnerable position. </p><p></p><p>In the corner of this slide, we see that Maratha has fallen victim to one of the classic blunders: splitting their forces between cities. Rustaq is now up to yellow health, while Muscat has started taking damage. Words of advice: learn from the mistakes of others. The Goths tried this strategy. It is not worth it.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Bass Strife"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the time since we last saw this battlefield, the Australian navy was a ways away and not primed to secure the area. Now, both sides are sending units in earnest, and the Bass Strait is the focal point of all this action. If there is one spot for Australia to halt the advancing New Zealand forces, this is it. The Murri triremes in the area are disappointed, as they had hoped for a successful Kiwi advance towards Adelaide. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Your eyes have not deceived you. That Nenet city of Sulomay was indeed captured from the Evenks, From the perspective of the Evenki central government, it’s as if the city just vanished. One day, it was sending dogsleds through the ice, bringing news of the city’s continued but harsh existence to the rest of the world. But those dogsleds have stopped coming, redirected instead to the mysterious homeland of the Nenets. The Evenks have sent a Reindeer Archer to investigate, but the expedition is not optimistic. After all, these are the harsh wastelands of northern Siberia.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings continue their joint assault on the Scottish cities of Stirling and Edinburgh, as both cities remain in the yellow. The loss of either city would be devastating for the Scottish, but the profit to be had from the Great Wall makes Edinburgh a far more attractive option for the Vikings to capture. The HRE knows this and has sent a small detachment of units to potentially snipe the beleaguered capital.</p><p></p><p>To the north, the HRE, Manx, and Vikings all race to see who can claim more of Greenland, although the Moorish city in the way might be a roadblock on the narrow coastal path to Greenland.</p>"

  scene_title: "Montezuma Needs A Castle Now"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the declaration of war has been shoved offscreen for now, the Aztecs and Apache are at war again, and this time, Geronimo is out for blood. Immediately, a line of Apache units has crossed into Aztec territory, where they have been met by a few sparse defending units. But while their forces may look one-sided, the Aztecs have a key defensive edge from the rough terrain of their core. Can the Apache fight through it given enough time? Perhaps, but the fight will be slow. What’s more important is that the Aztec colony in Oregon now faces incursions from all sides, so it’s anybody’s guess whether the Apache or Haida will capture the city first.</p>"

  scene_title: "Puerto Erin"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>In another case of important declarations being offscreened, the Isle of Mann has made peace with Venezuela, leaving the two Venezuelan colonies in the region uncontested for the time being. Canada, on the other hand, has experienced none of this peace, as Iroquois soldiers march on all but one of the remaining Canadian cities. Barring any poorly timed declarations of peace, it’s only a matter of time before Canada folds once and for all.</p>"

  scene_title: "Desert Storm"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Songhai and the Moors continue their assault on Libya, although only the Songhai appear to be making any progress. The Moors, after all, have split their forces and also must deal with the small yet feisty Libyan navy before they can commit their forces to laying siege to a city. The Songhai, on the other hand, have used their UU, the Mandekalu Cavalry, to quickly push to the gates of Benghazi. </p>"

  scene_title: "An Empty Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>If it weren’t for the damage effect clearly shown in this screenshot, it would be hard to tell that the Kazakhs and Evenks were even at war. This front has a good 1-tile gap between all belligerent parties, as the concentration of Evenk reindeer archers has formed a sort of no-mans-land. In a future time, this primitive no-mans-land will pale in comparison to the violence of modern arms, but for now, the premise of a hail of arrows is understandably not appealing to any sensible Kazakh soldiers.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>Returning to the Persian Gulf, we see that the Seljuq invasion of Nizwa has turned out to work in Parthia’s favor. Not only has the Seljuq attack fizzled out, but the distracted units have left a large chunk of Seljuq land open for Parthian units to occupy, Now, Nishapur faces the prospect of an enemy at the city’s gates. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, the Marathi invasion of Oman has reorganized around the city of Muscat, recognizing that perhaps a capital city is more important than a 7-pop coastal desert city. I commend the Marathi naval officers for this good judgment, although why they didn’t decide on this course of action sooner is beyond me.</p>"

  scene_title: "Montezuma’s Troubles Again"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode13-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Revisiting Montezuma’s Troubles, we see that the Apache invasion has progressed some, albeit slowly.

New Zealand, sensing that their ally is having some severe production shortages, has sent a detachment of units almost equivalent in size to the Sulu naval presence in the area, helping keep the Australian units at bay for now. However, the shockingly large Aussie naval presence in the area may prove decisive and turn this war into an offensive rather than defensive war. This points to an important reality of the conflict: Aussie production is roughly equal to the combined production of New Zealand and Sulu. If Australia manages to make headway here while keeping New Zealand at bay in the Bass Strait, they could have a huge advantage. But if the Murri join in, then it could have the complete opposite effect, placing Aussie workshops under tremendous strain.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The pikemen wandered through the jungle with difficulty, their pikes catching on vines every couple meters. At least they could move freely. This section of the jungle was relatively clear of traps, having only been occupied by ‘Kuro relatively recently. The other jungles had centuries worth of dangers built up. But as they came upon a clearing, they realized their overconfidence. The city of Secu had been revealed by a Uruguayan naval reconnaissance mission a long while ago, but few had made it this deep into the jungle to reveal what secrets the area hid. As they stepped out of the trees, an arrow whisked by their heads from over the river, then a hundred more followed suit. The pikeman ran back into the woods, some leaving their pikes behind altogether, while the lucky ones who weren’t in the leading group breathed a sigh of relief.</p>"

New Zealand also stands a lot to gain, as Adelaide has been brought to the red and only has a few scattered naval defenders to protect it,</p>"

  narration: "<p>And with that, the episode has come to an end! Here we see the civilizations that have chosen to use their production for more enlightened pursuits, with Zimbabwe topping the list in a manner not so distant from their Boer predecessors. </p><p></p><p>This has been an exciting episode to narrate, complete with some truly spectacular conflicts, a capital capture, and a stellar defensive performance by the Kuikuro.
