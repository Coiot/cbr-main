  narration: "<p>Welcome one and all to another episode of the Civ Battle Royale: Endgame! Chan to shiyotta ka? I hear that’s what they say in Shikoku when they haven’t seen their friends in a while. I’m Homusubi, last seen back in episode 106 of Mark 2, dormant Power Ranker (I’m sorry Gragg, I really am), creator of the Shikoku mod and most of the Japan options for Season 2. Far more importantly, though - I’d like to give a big o-kaeri - that’s welcome back - to Dawkinzz, who if everything goes well should be making his comeback this week.</p>"

  narration: "<p>There’s been plenty of great OC this week, including Lunar’s explanation to the bug that forced Endgame to happen in the first place and a lorry-load of wonderful civballs, but unfortunately, most of them are campaigning material and so can’t really be used here. The exception is this adorable collection of balls from /u/Sevastopol_Station, depicting season 2’s now-confirmed European cast. I particularly like the mad-scientist Kosovo, partly because it gives a good idea of what this civ’s gonna do to the world.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And here we have the testament to Vihreaa’s apparently superhuman-speed hand drawing. So many cities were settled last part that I had to flip between the two most recent maps a few times to realise that, of course, the last part also involved three taps of the F key. Settlers are just that fashionable right now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Looks like we don’t have the tile-accurate map again, so let’s copy Paddywagon_Man and showcase another OC. It’s another civball, but this time one from this season, as we say goodbye to the Apache after a surprisingly short showing in Endgame. Any Apache fans here, tell me in the comments whether you’re going to make yourself support either Iroquois or Metis, or just hope that some outside civ crushes them both. We also give the big Seabricks send-off to New Zealand and the Evenks this part, meaning that after all this time, we have officially seen over half of the eliminations in Seabricks, with the Evenks being the thirtieth. To all the surviving civs, plus New Zealand and the Apache - welcome, one and all, to the top half!</p>"

  narration: "<p>We saw the decisive expansion of the Kazakhs on the map slide, and so did the Power Rankers, who have kept them at number 1 as it increasingly looks like the sort of performance we were promised at the very start of Seabricks, when the Kazakhs also held the top spot. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We start with a view of Palmyra, Parthia, and Maratha, which looks like a three-way front with Palmyra sandwiched in the middle. At the same time, though, Palmyra have the terrain advantage versus Maratha, which should stand them in very good stead. Parthia seems a tougher opponent given their hordes of what appear to be their unique stronger horsemen, although civs with this much cavalry do tend to struggle taking cities. (Must resist urge to shill Emishi. Must resist urge to shill Emishi.)</p><p></p><p>Incidentally, I wonder if that Indian settler will ever find a place to settle? Currently it borders Nepal so it won’t settle there, and everywhere else I can see also borders at least one other civ or is within three tiles of Delhi.</p>"

  scene_title: "When You See the Jolly Roger down near Haina’s Mighty Shores"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Metis are continuing their campaign against the inland Haida holdings that we saw in the last part, and judging by the unit arrangement, they seem more concerned about dealing a killing blow to a few elk wandering about in the unclaimed territory north of Haina than taking the actual city. At least it’s sort of, vaguely, if you’re being really generous almost, sensible, because of their settler near the army. Hopefully when it actually settles, they’ll turn south though.</p><p></p><p>We also see the Yup’ik attacking the Haida - yes, if I’m not mistaken, that way around. Looks pretty stalematey, both of them have respectable land carpets, with the Haida having the edge navally and the Yup’ik geographically. It would benefit the Metis if it weren’t for their questionable troop logic.</p>"
- scene_number: 08
  scene_title: "Sunrise Land’s Sunset Invasion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Haida have done what Shikoku failed to do for an embarrassingly long time pre-E, and laid claim to Mount Fuji, simply by settling a city next to it rather than waiting forever for Nakamura to claim what it mistakes for an ordinary mountain. On one level I’m disappointed it’s not Shikoku. On another, I’m forced to admit that the middle of Mount Fuji’s crater would be a pretty cool place to put a single totem pole.</p><p></p><p>By the way, hats off to the map team for finding a way of making a Japan-shaped Japan at this scale that still has Shikoku as a separate island. Not an easy task, let’s say.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bermuda Trigonometry"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>I already knew Bermuda had a nice triangle of ocean around it, but extra points for the fish at each angle. What’s that? This slide isn’t just about staring at peaceful, fish-studded Caribbean seas? There’s an actual war going on? Um, OK, if you say so. Venezuela is making like pre-E Haiti and threatening Ganondagan with four triremes. I don’t know enough about defence values to say whether or not they’ll succeed, but the city’s full health and catapult garrison makes me think they won’t.</p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "Enrico, Blockading the Swimming Pool Isn’t Nice"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now for a shot of Venez without the Uela. Once again, it looks like we’re heading for about a four-trireme assault situation, once the Palmyrene triremes are dealt with. The city is sturdier this time, but has no catapult. Ultimately, this being closer to both cores than the Floridian fight was, it’ll probably depend on who pours more production into more triremes.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "America is Grey and Blue, America has Always been Grey and Blue"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>So I confess, I’ve forgotten whether or not the Iroquois and Metis are actually at war, or whether they have open borders and the damage is just the aftermath of the Apache war. Looks like the first. If so, seems pretty balanced, with perhaps some degree of Iroquois advantage due to lack of an immediate two-front war. Florida doesn’t count.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Is Burano just Murano with a Cold?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Likewise with the Manx and Prussia. Neither side has a clear advantage, although a lot of that is probably down to rough terrain and general incompetence rather than strength, where the Prussians have the lead. The Manx navy could strike a killing blow if it wanted to, taking Konigsberg and cheating on its famous bridges puzzle by means of jamming triremes between them, but we saw how good their naval tactics were last part, so I don’t have much hope there.</p>"

  scene_title: "All about the - sorry Dawkz - Grivpanvar"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>We return to this front just one turn after we last saw it. The Indian settler hasn’t moved. The Maratha attack is predictably fizzling out, and the Parthians, despite having a fearsome swarm of cavalry (also, shoutout to the modders for making god knows how many cavalry UUs and still finding new ways to put horses’ heads on icons), haven’t quite hit Merv properly. However, this is Civ, so anything could still happen.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bring your Fishing Boat to War Day"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Metis must have finally got their act together, quickly. Two turns after we last saw their laughably incompetent strike on Haina, the city has fallen, and the Haida don’t look like they’ll be able to flip it more than once maximum. Koyah travels to Skidegate to pray at the shrine of the turtle gods, who tell him that he should clearly be focusing more on naval battles, fighting the Yup’ik and of course improving his sea resources mid-double-war.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Multiple Nested Dejas Vu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>This looks suspiciously like the Florida strike that we saw Venezuela doing a few slides ago, but also like many, many prior naval assaults on pre-E Knossos. Elsewhere, we see the work boat mania isn’t limited to Koyah, as Piye and Enrico are also lending them out.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Krakatoa, Clearly West of Java"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Aussies are now venturing beyond the wall in force, perhaps looking to take out some wildlings only to realise that when you go north from Australia things get hotter rather than colder. As with their previous settle of Adelaide, they have ignored the obvious spot of southern Sumatra, and have landed a settler on Borneo, with another heading for the eastern half of Indonesia as well. I wonder what their army is going to do though? It’s a hell of an escort for a couple of settlers.</p><p></p><p>Also, we see an exclamation-mark notification in the sidebar. I believe that means Uruguay has changed political parties, but I’m not sure.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Arheimar, Arheimar, You Will Be Nice Place"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>It looks as if the Kazakhs are moving to attack the Goths, with a great general and several of their unique unit on the way to the front. It looks pretty meatgrindery, and it’s hard to say this soon into the attack which army will emerge with fewer casualties. Elsewhere, there are noticeably fewer horsemen around the Parthian capital, which could be very good or very bad for Palmyra depending on what’s hiding behind the minimap.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Mamma Mia!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Bad news all around for Venice fans as they both surrender their third city to Palmyra (having previously lost their second), and look in danger of losing Torcello to a well-equipped invasion force from Benin. Strangely enough, the Beninese delegation has too many melee units (don’t often say that) while the nearby Nubian army is pretty well-balanced by Nubian standards. Side-note: Mursiyyah’s border expansion is more concave than any non-player border I’ve seen possibly ever, and naming two nearby cities “Lido” and “Udo” is a bit sadistic with this font.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "The Sheer Merv of It"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Indian settler update: still nothing, although Indira has at least now claimed the sugar tile. The change in unit composition that I had previously noticed has turned out to be bad for Palmyra, as despite the cavalry bias, Parthia has charged into Merv. Thankfully, though, there are enough mountains to make any further progress awkward.</p><p></p><p>I might as well also point out the declarations of war in the sidebar. As Shikoku has apparently settled Sakhalin, a war with the Yup’ik might not be as uneventful as one might assume. Their choice of coalition partner leaves something to be desired though.</p>"

  scene_title: "Who’s Gonna Pay for the Wall? The Sand Dunes!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Benin has started to build its trademark snaky hexagonal walls over the Sahara, and has also settled to cover most of it and thus contain the Moors. It’s quite possible that in a few tens of turns, once they’ve fortified Eko, they could launch a successful attack on Mursiyyah, due to their mostly inland cities making it hard for the Moors to do any of their own advances.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Paysan-don’t-you-dare"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>There’s not much to see here other than a predictably strong Guay, complete with a healthily large number of catapults, and the continually burning city of Chauchilla. Venezuela had better get a move on to unify the northern half of South America, or the Guay might turn northwards. Then again, they might not, given their history.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Pointy Sticks, Backwards Compatible with Horses"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Surprisingly, Venezuela is statistically tied with the Guay in the pointy stick department, with Cahuachi not registering in the top eight. First place goes to, somewhat nostalgically, Ablai Khan, while we also see good Goo news, as they continue a steady and peaceful buildup much as they did pre-E. The Qin and Moors are looking strong too, and I hope Shikoku and Benin have a counter.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "It Was Called Wajima, Then they Found the Uranium"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uwajima is a medium-sized town in western Shikoku with an original castle, and its inhabitants are likely surprised to find that they’re actually in the Arctic tundra being attacked by triremes occupied by native Alaskans. While the lack of offensive strength against the Yup’ik is disappointing, I’m not worried about four triremes at the gates of Uwajima, given Ryoma’s strongish carpet surrounding the city. I just hope they don’t send any more in. The Haida should take care of that. Right?</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "A to Z"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>That’s a lot of wars at once. Zenobia is the target of a joint declaration by two leaders with names from the other end of the alphabet, although neither seems to actually border Palmyra. Thanks Parthia. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, the aforementioned steadily-expanding Goo has decided that Adelaide is blocking the aim of blobbing all over Indochina, and as it stands, it looks like they stand a good chance of taking the city. There’s also an anti-Prussian coalition, with the Vikings having the potential to change the dynamics of the Manx-Prussia war.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "...Huh."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>As expected, Benin is drawing closer to Torcello without facing much resistance, although I do question the wisdom of their holding the catapult back three tiles away from the city. The big news on this slide, however, is that the Moor-Palmyrene war might in fact be relevant, as the former have a large fleet of triremes which, while probably unable to save the burning Murano, might be able to snag Lido when the Venetians couldn’t.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "They Are at War, Right?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite the large number of units on both sides, it doesn’t look like Nubia and Zimbabwe are actually doing much to each other. I’d blame the cavalry, but that didn’t seem to stop Parthia earlier. Other than that, this slide appears to be more notable just for the sheer number of Zimbabwean forward settles stretching up East Africa and increasingly dominating the Arabian Peninsula. And then there’s that sidebar, with even more declarations than before...</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "World of Goo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite Taungoo becoming the target of an ever-larger coalition - I only realised last slide that Australia declared war on the Goo, not the other way round - they seem to be on the offensive on two fronts at once. Maratha do not look like they’ll be able to advance through the rough terrain guarding Allahabad, while Bayinnaung has an outside chance at taking Satara. As for the Qin, it looks like Nepal and Canton are acting as a shield stretching across the Himalayas and beyond. See? They are relevant!</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Slow Movement on the Torcello"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>One more turn has passed, and we’re back to this front. It’s worth noting that Benin’s catapult is now in posi - wait, what’s this? Nubia are at war with Venice too? Bit late for the snipe, although they do have a horseman, so who knows. Elsewhere, the Moors are doing an admirable job of trying to save Murano, with the city already in the yellow. I didn’t know Abd ar-Rahman was so thoughtful.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Naruhodo!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>We seem to have a potential explanation for why Endgame is here in the first place. See that sea east of Borneo? That’s supposed to be one weirdly-shaped island, Sulawesi, not three different ones, one now with an Aussie colony on it. I can only conclude that some sort of giant meteorite hit the Cylinder at that spot, radically changing Sulawesi’s geography and wiping out most complex life in the process. The immortals, of course, just shrugged and started anew.</p><p></p><p>As for more current events - India and Canton were at war? Well, they’re not now, OK. We need a one-word term for “completely irrelevant peace declarations”, because typing that out every time takes way too long. Anyway, actual war. Taungoo, again, has the better tactics here, because the Gooey embarked units are coupled with actual triremes, rather than just lots of embarked swordsmen and nothing else, presumably trying to paddle their way north by means of their weapons.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Absolute Med-lads"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>They’ve done it! The Moors have saved Murano! Totally a compassionate move with no geopolitical ulterior motives at all, honest. Lido now looks in danger from the heroes of the Moorish navy, and in Africa, the Nubians are making the Torcello snipe a real possibility.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "The Goo Must Flow"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Although it is becoming increasingly difficult to take a city with only triremes, there is an outside chance of Taungoo managing this one. After Murano, anything is possible. On the other hand, Maratha will likely flip it right back. Either way, it’ll distract them from actually attacking in what is supposed to be an offensive war.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Mervous Twitching"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Deja vu once more, as Zimbabwe gets its cavalry regiment to rush Chitekete in a way reminiscent of Parthian actions earlier in the part. Nubia is having better luck against Kiteve further north, but in order to stay relevant, Piye really needs to come out best on both fronts.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "So They Were at War with the Metis!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Title says it all. It looks like the two great powers of North America have beaten out a bloody draw in the last ten turns, the Iroquois still looking threatening around Lepai-Nde but the Metis apparently having tried an assault on Shis-Inday. If it weren’t for the Haida war the Metis would likely be doing bet - oh, they made peace this turn? Go for it, Louis. What’s more, the minimap seems to suggest that he has held Haina in the deal.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Breaking News from… oh."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hands up all of you who hoped this slide would be South America. Don’t lie now. No, despite the Uruguayan declaration on Venezuela we saw last slide, we’re back in the Med again. What this slide seems to suggest is that things have finally stabilised, with Torcello in Beninese hands after all and Lido safe from Moorish assault. I apologise to any Venice supporters reading this for being the breaker of what must be excruciatingly bad news.</p>"

  scene_title: "Paysan-Does It Work?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ahhh, here we are! Actually, it looks like this war could be OK for Venezuela, and not just because of the tied pointy-stick stats from a few turns ago. The terrain favours the defenders, after all. If I was either leader here, I would have gone for Nazca.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Reverse Florida Man Manoeuvre"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now it’s the Iroquois who are seeking to ape Haiti, by attacking Venezuela the other way across the Caribbean Sea. They might have had a chance to flip a city had they concentrated their forces, but no, they split them, and so are going to fail miserably. Can’t Hiawatha see that Chavez has a world to save from his other border here?</p>"

  scene_title: "Chite-get!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh, so Palmyra were also at war with Zimbabwe? Nice snipe, Zenobia, now for Chibuene. In other news, Mutota has done what it looked like he’d do last time we saw this region, and reclaimed Chitekete. This puts his forces on Piye’s doorstep, and Uselu could conceivably fall, but only if Piye is truly incompetent with his forces.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>I worried when we last saw the Manx that their settling game wasn’t up to much, and it looks like the Moors, spurred on by an ancient legend of Manxmen snatching rightful Moorish clay in Brittany, have decided to get their own back by sending a settling party to County Kerry. Illiam had better get a move on, or the Vikings will settle Scotland too.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Did I say Vikings? Sorry, I meant the Iroquois, who seem to have already reached Britain and royally forward-settled our favourite one-tile island kings. Saraqustah, that is quite the Gadoquat… also, the Iroquois have built two wonders. One’s the Great Mosque of Djenne, so probably not important here. Not sure about the other one.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs are, very slowly but kinda surely, dealing with the Gothic carpet, and look more able to ride for Arheimar than the last time we saw them. The Sami, spotting an opportunity, have declared war on the Goths. Although a one-tile gap isn’t going to be easy to attack through, and so the wisdom of this declaration can be questioned, bear in mind that a Goth is unlikely to get along with their granny.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If I had seen this slide earlier on in the day I might have been able to think of an Azores pun. As it stands, I can’t. Anyway, the Moors have settled ‘Isbiliyyah on the aforementioned archipelago. A useful forward base post-Astronomy perhaps, and it’s good that they gave it time to develop by settling it this early on, but right now, it doesn’t mean much.</p>"

  narration: "<p>What in the World of Goo is going on? Adelaide is still threatened, but not as much as before, and only by land units. Australia have apparently managed to convert their fleet of embarked swordsmen into actual triremes and are threatening Sagaing. The Qin have blockaded Pyay, although they are unlikely to do more than irritate Bayinnaung. On the Maratha front, Satara is in the yellow and a detachment has managed to fight its way to the gates on land. Move along, move along, everything to see here.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode41-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another shot of the Persian front, as Palmyra make peace with Zimbabwe and so secure Kiteve. The front with the Parthians has grown cold for now, despite the potential for it to quickly heat up again in only a couple of turns or so, while the one with Maratha has solidified into minor-irritant status. Losing Circesium could significantly alter the dynamics of this region, but don’t count on it happening just yet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Manx mainland possessions have been significantly shrunk by a Prussian citadel, and there are two more generals nearby. Remember what happened last time Prussia put a citadel down in this part of the map? ...Yeah, that. Poor Illiam doesn’t know what’s gonna hit him. Ragnar, for his part, is doing a noticeably bad job at fighting the Prussians at sea. Meanwhile, at the royal court in Taungoo, Bayinnaung is surprised to hear that he has been personally denounced by some guy wandering around the tundra ranting about reindeer and Shikokunese invasion to anyone who can hear.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tosa-Aki is a small town on a mountainous, sparsely populated stretch of coastline in southeastern Shikoku, not too far from the south-facing Cape Muroto, one of the remotest places in the country. So unlike Uwajima, this is not that inaccurate of a settle. The main difference is that this Tosa-Aki appears to have been founded in an active warzone - not the first time I’ve seen Shikoku do this, actually - and, although the Yup’ik have gone on the defensive with a smaller military than before, it is also notable that the Haida have mostly vanished. One last peculiar thing about this front is that neither civ appears to have any composite bowmen, with the Yup’ik still on regular archers with Shikoku deciding to have a ranged force made entirely of catapults for some reason.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kazakh legend tells of invisible-yet-still-purple otherworldly creatures that call the frozen north home, but the consensus among Astana scholars looks to be that any possibility that they may have existed before the devastation caused by the Sulawesi meteorite has now been thoroughly erased. As such, the Kazakhs are now fearless in settling these lands, with at least four snow cities already out and a fifth on its way. Shikoku, too, is on a settling spree not unlike the pre-E one that got it past three cities after god knows how many parts stuck to one half of Japan. Oko was only recently founded, and Ryoma has a second settler out to go with the one from the previous slide.</p>"

Venice, with mostly every tile equipped with horse destroying Spearman look on at awe as more balanced armies rest to the north, and even sharper spears rest to the Moorish city of Murano. It’s tough to see how Venice could fight anybody without heavy losses. Murano is the only city that can be captured, but it might be too late for Dandolo.</p><p></p><p>In more serious war battles, the Venician scout gets attacked by the Gothic horseman nearby.

With the isle being settled by aggressive new world nations, with Vikins carpeting just east of them and Moors building up impressive stats. With the obvious intentions to unite France under one golden orange banner, it’s only a matter of time until they become isolated.</p><p></p><p>Vikings situation is a bit more nice. Having a fully carpeted empire with unique units is always an advantage, however due to the amount of water surrounding their core, unless they can punch hard against the weakened Sami they might just stagnate into non-existence. Perhaps settling Iceland and uniting the islands with an impressive naval carpet can let them capitalize on the eventual British Isle showdown, there’s not much avenues of success for Ragnar.</p><p></p><p>Also, note the Oracle was constructed by the one Civilization likely to complete the social policy tree first due to their impressive UA.

  narration: "<p>The classic problem when I settle to many cities in a wide open map that I cannot navigate my huge armies around. However, unlike myself, Shikoku has no barbs to use the army with, so now they have to make an uncomfortable decision. Do they strike full force at the Yup’ik and take their capital. Do they mass an army and strike east to capture Kazakh cities before they get out of control or do they try to form an alliance to crush Qin from both sides, most likely sacrificing Canton in the process. No decision is ideal, so for now Sakamoto needs to think, and most likely spend an era moving his units from Kamchatka to China.</p>"

With only three major tiles, it seems the key into Europe will be the acquisition of the Manx cities of Burano and Ramsey as the extra tiles that will afford could allow Moors to more safely run in. But yet again, strategy online does not equate to strategy in game and when you’re as far ahead militarily as Moors, it only seems like a matter of time until those catapults become trebuchets and they begin knocking on Stettins door forevermore.</p>"

Another settler is on its way, too, although it’s hard to see where. Surely they’re not going for the Kodiak peninsula? Further south, we see the Qin have taken Hokkaido and have their own eastbound settler, while the Aussies settle Geelong in Iwate and see it converted to… I’m not going to get Dawkz to say that.</p><p></p><p>While it looks like Shikoku have lost control of their homeland, in fact, it appears that their actual homeland, aka the one-tile island in western Japan, is still unclaimed.
