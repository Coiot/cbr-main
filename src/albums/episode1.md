  narration: "<p>A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. This is Coiot, your host
    for the first Episode of Season 1 of CBRX. On behalf of all Blue Cassette, we
    welcome you to the new Battle Royale. It has been some time since Mk2.1 ended
    in December 2018, and the team has been recording X1 since early March. The game
    is presently beyond T900+, but today we're going to go over the first 30 turns
    and give some quick introductions and some inside information from the results
    of our test runs of this setup.</p>"

  narration: "<p>OC of this Week goes to TopHat. Here we can see the dastardly Pedro
    the II scheme over his plans for CBRX. Pedro might have painted the submarine
    in his colors, but it is still going to be all unpredictable chaos from the start.
    We won't be seeing much more of him; although, Mini-Pedro will be live and active
    on the Discord as he will be announcing when the website has been updated with
    the images. For those that want a tiny head start (less than a minute), be sure
    to join the Discord as our bot will announce the second the website has the images,
    which will usually be a 20-30 seconds before midnight UTC time depending on the
    CDN caching time.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>Erlen has a new updated tile accurate map for everyone. This time,
    he has painstakingly gone and placed ever river on the map to better help us locate
    the exact locations of each civ. It really does add another layer of context.
    For map lovers like us, we can also look forward to precisely accurate tile maps
    from here on out as the entire in-game map will be shown each week in our Director's
    Cut videos and albums.</p>"

  narration: <p>Many in the community are already aware of our <a href="https://www.patreon.com/civbr"
    title="Blue Cassette‘s Patreon Donation Page">Patreon Page</a>, which we‘ve setup
    to cover our server hosting, image hosting, and electricity bills which we accumulate
    from bringing you our content. We do not ask for much, and if the CBRX is something
    you come to regularly to enjoy, please do consider supporting us each month, even
    if it is for $1 USD.</p> <p>We already provide a few cosmetic bonuses, and early
    access to our Director‘s Cut videos and albums, for our Patreons on Reddit and
    Discord, and I am planning to carry over some bonuses to donators on this new
    website as well. As always, no content will be locked behind a paywall, but having
    a little something to stand out or get content early is the least we can give
    back.</p> <p>If for whatever reason you cannot give through Patreon, or prefer
    one-time donations as opposed to recurring ones, I have also setup a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/cbrtv"
    title="Coiot‘s Ko-Fi Crowdfunding Page">Ko-Fi Page</a> where you can donate. I
    need all the help the community can send, and while we usually cover the website
    bills, we do not get anything in return for all the time and energy spent, and
    we do not come close to breaking even for what the four of us collectively do
    each week.</p>

  narration: '<p>The Kazakhs remain the undisputed #1 choice for the Power Ranking
    (PR) team. Just by looking at the setup, it is easy to see why. We‘ll get to the
    Kazakhs a little later, but if you have not already read through the <a href="https://aar.li/a/hgo5xd"
    title="Power Ranking X1 Episode 0">Episode 0</a> album, be sure to queue that
    up in your browser.</p><p>With the usual prelude images covered, let‘s move onto
    the screenshots.</p>'

  scene_title: From the Depths, Brazil comes Forth
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene06.jpg
  narration: <p>Here we go. On to the first screenshot. All the screenshots from this
    episode, and some of the next up to T50, are all actually recorded from my own
    CBR-capable machine that I acquired earlier this year. I ran dozens of CBRX test
    runs, some of which were streamed live in my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/volpe_/videos"
    title="Twitch Channel">Twitch Channel</a>, and the ‘final’ Season 1 run started
    off first in my machine before being handed over to Reon for the 24/7 video recording.</p><p>I‘ll
    take a little time here to note some of the format changes. We‘ve introduced a
    more consistent and thematically relevant naming convention for the albums. Each
    edition of CBRX will be a <strong>Season</strong>, with each album an <strong>Episode</strong>,
    and every image within a <strong>Scene.</strong> The Scene change in particular
    from the previous simple <strong>Slide</strong> catch-all for every image was
    to differentiate better the introductory images, the screenshots, the stats images,
    and the new intermediary info images that will appear within Episodes to provide
    summaries of notifications that do not always appear on the screen (like some
    wars, city flips, capital flips, and HRE leader changes). As viewers have begun
    to notice, even though this is Scene 6, it has its own title that is not simply
    Slide 6 or Screenshot 1. This way, when discussing images, it will be easy to
    refer to specific images without confusion over slide number and screen shot number.
    This also allows for narrators to introduce a little more creativity and flavor
    to their text by providing title names for the screenshots.</p> <p>Something funny
    to mention here, and no doubt on your mind, is that the sub will not be visible
    at the start of the game. Furthermore, during my tests, I would not even be bothered
    to place the actual sub there, instead leaving our Brazil-themed Babylonian settler
    and accompanying units here in the Antarctic crater unrevealed. The sub is replaced
    later, but for now, it is actually our lightly-clothed little dudes huddled in
    the shadows of these mountains.</p>

  scene_title: Chillin‘ with the Nords
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Let's cycle through our lineup. Starting off is Ragnar (Vikings)
    and Eadni (Sami) which are Scandinavian region representatives. As Yago has denounced
    on Reddit, the Vikings are sporting the more bright orange hued color scheme than
    their usual pink on black. The Sami are strong contenders, and the PR team has
    good faith in them. Faith in particular is the right word, as the Sami will attempt
    to establish their unique religion and begin to expand in the empty space between
    them and Muscovy. </p>"

  scene_title: Reindeer Vistas
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Bombogor (Evenks) knows most of the community will be overlooking
    the Evenks. This space of mostly tundra on the upper edge of Siberia is all too-often
    overlooked in favor of the fan-favorites in more cozy East Asia. A quiet civ due
    to their starting location, but this is a civ that likes to settle cities, so
    be sure to not forget about them.</p>"
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Bering Straits
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yup‘ik are commonly compared with past Mk2 contestants the Inuit.
    However, Apaanugpak is not Ekeuhnick, even though both are legendary figures.
    For one, the Yup‘ik do not have as many tile bonuses as the Inuit in similar terrain,
    and they have more immediate neighbors in the Haida and the Métis. They do have
    their unique warrior here already, the Alutiiq Hunter, which can embark right
    away, settle cities, and provide a unique arctic luxury if they do so. </p>"
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Remainers
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our British Isles representatives are Illiam Dhone (Manx) and Robert
    the Bruce (Scotland). Robert the Bruce has transcended to Civ6, but returns here
    to lay claim to this corner of Europe. Challenging them will be the Manx, who
    start a bit flat-footed being on a one-tile island. Do not count them out just
    yet, but the first few parts will determine how long they can survive against
    the better positioned Scotland. </p>"
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Nur-Sultan
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shame about the recent name change, but here we have the glorious
    city of <strong>Astana</strong>, ruled over be Ablai Khan of the Kazakhs. Everyone
    has high expectations for the Kazakhs, and do not start off ranked at #1 for nothing.
    A good civ, with plenty of room, and a somewhat decent color scheme. I can taste
    the potassium already! </p>"
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 'Hawk Whisperers '
  narration: "<p>Fiona's feisty Khamug Khanate lead by Jamukha. A civ that like the
    Evenks just up north will be overlooked at the start of the game, but those that
    have seen multiple tests know that the Khamug will be raiding in all directions
    and can obtain big-boi status relatively quickly. A fine civ to be a fan of if
    you are not already decided. </p>"

- scene_title: Raven Mischief
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now here are the undisputed top-tier (no bias, I swear, really).
    The Haida led by Koyah. Former Buccaneer aficionados (like me) will find a lot
    to love with the Haida. The true pirates of this season (no joke). This is true
    thanks to their Unique Ability, Eagle and Raven, which allows for naval melee
    units to perform attacks on land, and embarked units can perform melee attacks
    on naval targets. They also love to spam their unique trireme, the War Canoe,
    so the entire coast lines from Kamchatka to Baja California are often under Haida
    control in test runs. Plus, their primary color is salmon. </p>"
  scene_number: "13"
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Mixed Feelings
  narration: "<p>Louis Riel leads the Métis and is our second Canadian representative
    after Canada itself. The Métis are a trade centered civ that like to bulk up and
    have good relations. The PR team has ranked them high for their relatively safe
    and stable position, but test runs tend to leave the Métis trapped in their comfort
    zone. A safe civ to bet on to survive long into the game. Although they have a
    strong rivalry with the Apache, so conflict is not something they avoid altogether.</p>"

  scene_title: 'Overlooking Lake Ontario '
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>For an even more intense North American rivalry, here are Lunar's
    Canada and Chrisy's modified Iroquois. Two civs this close were always going to
    be at each other's throats, and the Iroquois’ infamous aggression will be the
    start of many conflicts between these two. William Lyon Mackenzie King (Canada)
    has many production focused unique traits that can turn Canada into a continent
    sweeping monster, if they survive into the modern era to make use of them that
    is. Whichever one of these civs wins the duel of fates will easily go on to be
    a top contender.</p>"
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Europa League
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Look at all this rightful HRE clay. Well it would be, but SabyZ's
    Czech Republic lead by Vaclav Havel stands in the way. Czechia is a fan favorite
    that is consistent in conquering vast swaths of Europe, and their unique paratrooper,
    the Vysakdar, can edge them on to have a big advantage later in the game. A potential
    Finland in the making. Lowly Prussia lead by Fredrick in the corner tends to settle
    well but has a notoriously weak AI. Prussia's focus on domination and military
    centered uniques are enough to ensure they at least won't go down without a fight.
    The big question mark is actually the Holy Roman Empire (HRE), which is a true
    wild card in every sense. They roll biases all over the place, and you never know
    how they will perform. This is in part due to their unique ability, Imperial Election,
    which randomly changes the leader of the civ upon every era. On the subbreddit
    will be an exhaustive list of possible leaders, including the Sith Lord Pedro
    the II himself. I can give you special insight though and reveal that the starting
    leader this run is Bismarck (how typical for our German civ).</p>"
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Rigged Elections
  narration: "<p>Tomatekh's Goths lead by Alaric have an excellent AI and typically
    stand out in AI games. They like to fight hard, and fight often, so those that
    like to follow an aggressive civ should be comfortable supporting them. Their
    name and color scheme are sure to attract many, and the memes will be most delicious.</p><p>Further
    north is Muscovy lead by Ivan IV. Muscovy has all the right ingredients to be
    a regional power, and the mod's creator JFD has packed it with uniques that would
    allow Muscovy to really shine in a BR. For some reason though they are always
    middle of the pack contenders, but don't sleep on them. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another Khan, but this great unifier Tokhtamysh, fearsome ruler over
    Tartar lands. Him and his civ's name Golden Horde (GH) are perhaps the most notable
    thing to say about them. Created by obscure modder Chaingunfighter1, GH was such
    an outdated mod that Lime had to reconstruct it from the ground up to be allowed
    into the competition. GH is rather divisive since it was a decrepit civ taking
    up a slot that could have gone to more favored civ to dominate the region. Saying
    that though, GH does have its chances, and tends to perform rather well despite
    the negative reception.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Even though the Qing are centered better in the next screenshot,
    let‘s talk about these three together. The three Chinese representatives, the
    Qin, Qing, and Xia all have something going for them.</p><p>The Xia are one the
    most interesting mod civs available. Their unique ability, Dynastic Cycle, grants
    them stacking bonuses each time they lose their capital, construct a courthouse
    in a conquered foreign capital, or complete a social policy tree. Upon each change,
    the name of their capital will change, as well as their dynasty name.</p><p>The
    Qing, lead by Cixi, have already established a reputation to dominate just like
    the Manchu's did IRL. It is typical in test runs to see them great large armies
    rapidly, and even when at a city disadvantage, often field a larger military than
    their opponents. Don't be surprised if the Qing win many wars, giving them a straight
    path to regional domination.</p><p>Captain's Qin are not favored by the community
    over the adored Xia or the ruthless Qing, but given they have much space to work
    with, it is no surprise they perform well in test runs. Their unique ability,
    the Great Unity, allows them to gain the unique traits of conquered civs when
    they control the defeated original capitals.</p>"
  scene_title: Romance of the Three Kingdoms?
- scene_number: "20"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Senshidenshi's Joseon lead by Seonjo is our Korean representative.
    Seonjo brings with him many military focused uniques, with an emphasis on naval
    domination. Test runs show that they make great use of their naval power, and
    often have large over seas empires. Unlike vanilla Korea's Sejong, this civ will
    not be a science juggernaut, which means being trapped in the peninsula will not
    give them enough resources to turtle-up and fight when they have a tech advantage
    over their neighbors. The PR team ranked them in the bottom ten, but this seems
    like a rather big underestimation for the Koreans once again.</p>"
  scene_title: Shell Shocked
- scene_number: "21"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shikoku is our Japanese representative and are lead by Sakamoto Ryoma.
    This civ comes from Japanese civ specialist Homusubi, but their pedigree does
    not come with much assurances that they will do well in the BR. While still ranked
    above Korea, Shikoku is very inconsistent in performance, and their uniques do
    not really offer much of an advantage over their immediate rivals. It will take
    a combination of several good fortunes for them to replicate the success they
    had in a test run where they owned most of the Pacific islands. </p>"

  scene_title: 'Geronimo! '
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uighur_Caesar's Apache are lead by the famous Geronimo. Their uniques
    give them good bonuses when raiding and pillaging, and past AI games show that
    the Apache AI will make good use of them. Even so, the fact that they have a good
    starting location with plenty of land to expand upon means that even with no bonuses
    the Apache would always perform well in this BR. It comes to no surprise that
    the PR team places them in the top 10.</p>"
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Rags to Riches
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Poverty Point on the face of it, has everything to be an entertaining
    civ, but whose AI more often than not leads to disappointment. The open land in
    North America available to them is a bit of a double-edged sword as Táhera, their
    leader, gets over excited and settles quickly, but often far apart, leading to
    over-extension which the Apache and the Iroquois are all too happy to exploit.
    They do have a wonderful unique ability which revolves around the choice of Spirit
    Guardians which grant them specific bonuses, but it seems to be beyond what the
    AI can comprehend how to effectively use. If they survive long enough, they could
    be a fun civ to follow. </p>"
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Such Meme
  narration: "<p>Venice is another vanilla modified civ by Chrisy, and it is presently
    a very polarizing civ in Season 1's lineup. There are many worthy civs that Venice
    beat out in the voting and by the tiniest of margins, too. The leader remains
    the same, doge Enrico Dandolo, but this civ is allowed to build settlers. There
    is not much confidence in Venice given their crowded starting location, and very
    lackluster performances in test runs. Time could prove all the haters wrong though,
    and some fans might revel in that hope. </p>"

  scene_title: Turkish Delight
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Ottomans, lead by Mehmed II, is another JFD entry to the lineup,
    and a change in their starting location to Bosporus. Like other JFD civs in X1,
    this civ has great military options. The Bombard in particular, their cannon replacement,
    is a true monster. Unlocked at gunpowder, it provides -20% Combat Strength (11
    vs 14), but +1 Range (3 vs 2) and +350% Combat bonus vs Cities (vs 200%). This
    extra reach and firepower, coupled with their Janissaries, might paint the cylinder
    in a new shade of green. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>TarcisioCM's Parthia lead by Mithridates I is a mid-game optimized
    civ that wants to obtain as many horses as possible to spam their two unique units.
    A civ that could have had guaranteed regional victory if it was not for the immediate
    southern neighbor. But Parthia is still a very solid civ that can hold its own
    against the more favored Kazakhs and take the opportunities presented to them.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Prithvi Narayan (Nepal) and Indira Gandhi (India) are another sure-fire
    rivalry that will decide how this part of the map will be colored. Both civs seem
    equally matched at first, with test runs having them equally balanced in the early
    stages, but India has nuclear weapon uniques and a paratrooper unit that can give
    it a big advantage not just over Nepal, but any civ they decide to turn their
    attention to. This does not mean Nepal does not have its own advantages, as they
    have plenty of room to expand to if the Qin decide to focus more on China, leaving
    many mountain tiles available for them to exploit their unique bonuses on. </p>"

  narration: "<p>One of the two only pure vanilla civs in the game, the Aztecs already
    have fans with a year's worth of notoriety behind them for being shit-posting
    extraordinaries. The Aztecs tend to be average but safe choices to support. They
    have all of Mexico and Central America at their disposal, but test runs show that
    this AI does not like to settle as much as they really should. A rather bland
    civ that will most certainly be spiced up through community effort as opposed
    to in-game performance.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode1-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Abdelkader (Algeria) is a curious civ in that it is one of hte least
    inspiring choices in the whole region, but it has found its way into the BR. DJSHenninger
    has designed a good civ, with uniques that would favor a well rounded approach
    to doing well. Even if the AI may not know how to best use its uniques, Algeria
    certainly spams their unique unit, the Dey, which can build their unique citadels,
    the Ksars. Ksars deal more damage to surrounding troops than regular citadels,
    and Algeria has carpeted all of North Africa before in test runs with them. Not
    quite the Pholus Mutagen level of surrounding damage, but if they cover the desert
    with them, it will be difficult for any civ to invade them. </p><p>The Moors on
    the other hand, lead by Abd-ar Rahman III, are already well familiar with the
    CBR community. Having also been voted for entry into Mk3, the Moors are consistent
    well performers in AI games and test runs. If the Moors can survive until they
    can build their crossbowman replacement, the Granadine Cavalry, we might see the
    majority of Europe painted in their colors.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Omar Mukhtar (Libya) is Jmangelo's pride and joy, and was easily
    voted into Season 1. Libya is another citadel spamming Maghreb representative
    that in many ways is very similar to their close rival in Algeria. Libya has the
    advantage of having an AI that races to be amongst the first, if not the first,
    civ to always found a religion in test runs, and viewers can be assured that Sunni
    Islam will make an approach in Tripoli. Libya's position is not the most generous,
    and will have to wait for rare opportunities to expand beyond the coastline. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Minoa, lead by Minos, is another wild card that if it was not contained
    to this one-tile island start and crowded region would surely be in the top 10
    in rankings instead of the bottom 10. This AI is incredibly good, and extremely
    aggressive. If Minoa are given an inch, they will take the region, and then some.
    Their success really comes down to where they settle first. They tend to favor
    the Nile Delta, which while a very attractive settlement between those river plains,
    nearby Nubia does not like strangers on their river. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Firebug's Palmyra lead by Zenobia already has plenty of fans in the
    community, and their start is just right to ensure they can build up to take the
    fight to their neighbors. Coupled with a wonderful color scheme, and a strong
    early game, this civ is known to easily be in the top half of civs, and the PR
    team has ranked them appropriately at 21. </p><p>But Alp Arslan (Seljuqs) is a
    pebble in the shoes of both Palmyra and Parthia. Nested in the middle of Persia,
    the Seljuqs have not much where to go, and it will take a while for them to have
    the means to really challenge anyone. On top of that, Oman likes to settle rather
    close to the areas most likely for them to want to build a defensive line around.
    It'll be tough being a Seljuq fan, but maybe some fans like cheering for a true
    underdog.</p>"

    is hard to even notice them in between all those jungle tiles. But the Taungoo
    are a dark horse, and not an underdog, with plenty of room to grow and some interesting
    uniques to bolster up South East Asia. In particular, their unique ability, Ahmudan
    Conscription, allows all of their puppeted cities to produce a free melee unit
    every 5 turns during golden ages. They gain golden age points for conquering cities,
    so the larger their empire grows, the larger their military can potentially become.
    They do not have many immediate neighbors to start conquering, but if they can
    get there, this civ will never be short of troops.</p>"

    true. Anything that Haiti does well will be the cause of much celebration.</p><p>DMS‘s
    Venezula on the other hand is almost the exact opposite. This civ''s starting
    rank is at #10 and test runs collaborate with this assessment. It is not endowed
    with the best of uniques, but the AI is quite strong and has rather tame neighbors

    early on. The PR team has high expectations of them, placing them at #24, but
    in my tests runs it seems like they might be the target of many invasions as all
    their neighbors want to claim their resource heavy domain. The Songhai have a
    decent chance to paint this part of the world in their colors for a very long
