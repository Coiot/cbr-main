  narration: Hello everyone, this is /u/LunarNeedle once more with narration for Part
    101! We had an amazing narration on behalf of the team, so I thought I‘d follow
    it up with narration from... well, that‘s for later. For now, I‘m to introduce
    the OC, chosen from the sub favorite AlbinosRideDinos details why the small Vietnam
    underneath the assimilated Tibetan motivational coach tries to discuss a peace
    treaty. Results were less than favorable...

  narration: Ah, the Boer‘s. Enjoying their new found gains and not worrying about
    the carnival goers at all in their country, nope, not, never. Why would they do
    that? The Boer machine might have to adapt rapidly for when the Carnival is over,
    and the chaos is all too close.

  narration: DerErlenkonig, rating a solid 7/10 in difficult to say name provides
    us an even more solid 10/10 map, having opted to delay the release the confirm
    a few things that happened in the PR slides. He‘s the reason we have an amazing
    GIF that goes through the entirety of the event in the Battle Royale. Seriously,
    check it out.

  narration: Spherical_Melon, has an opposite problem. He has the easiest name to
    say and the most information but his map looks utterly chaotic. Not helping things
    is the amount of bordergore around bombed out shells. It seems that unification
    under one banner would be the only way to get Greece and the Middle East back
    to normality... Actually that would result in more husks which result in more
    bordergore. This truly has gone off the deepend, hasn‘t it?

  narration: A vintage map was the headlining act on the centennial part, so it makes
    sense to post a more modern rendition here done by Monkey_Chumbles. I think the
    infection is spreading far faster than this graphic entails and might require
    an immediate amputation of Open Borders to fix the solution.  Alas, the fix to
    people being happy is happening, so maybe the agitated neighbours will ask for
    more for the legendary Open Borders agreement. Maybe they‘ll ask for Citrus and
    4GPT?! Alas, this is my tenure cut short, as I‘ll past it to someone with a bit
    more stopping power. He whom made the two best expansions in Civ history, he who
    made this game as amazing as it is. Ed Beach.

  narration: |-
    Hello to the Civ Battle Royale Community!  I was happy to jump in and accept this invitation to narrate this episode of CBR because I’ve really appreciated how epic this Civ V AI battle has become. As many of you know I started Civ V as our AI lead and along with getting our AI code in place for that title, I had to evaluate its performance on a daily basis.
    So what was our tool to accomplish that? You guessed it: AI autoplay games!  Over the three years I was in that AI lead role I watched hundreds and hundreds of AI games and reviewed the results both in the game world and through our extensive AI logs.  It was my life for a long time.
    So with AI autoplays being the original genesis of the Civ Battle Royale idea, I feel a definite kinship. Though I do admit I never imagined that we’d ever end up with something so absolutely epic in scope and detail. So take this guest narration as my way to pay back the CBR community for their efforts to turn these games into something amazing.

  narration: |-
    However we’ve been pretty busy at Firaxis working on the successor to Civ V, so although I watched the first 10 or 20 episodes of CBR very carefully, I must confess to being out of the loop for most of the recent action.  So don’t expect any true expert commentary here. Instead we’ll have a combination of gawking at the world that has been created and then I’ll patch in some of the notes that the CBR team forwarded on my way.
    Note that we are starting on Turn 154 this time and we’ll proceed for 19 turns up to Turn 173. Here we can see the precursor to our Civ VI Australian civ trying to hang on to their foothold on the Asian mainland. They are down to just the single city of Vigan.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene08.jpg
  narration: In Civ V we represented Brazil as being good at overseas military endeavors
    with their WWII era Pracinha unique units.  But conquering remote islands in the
    Indian Ocean?  Impressive indeed!
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene09.jpg
  narration: The Kimberleys as indigenous Australians are a great idea for a civ.
    Nice to see them still hanging in there alongside their European colonial brethren.
    But every one of their cities has damage on it.  How long will they hold out?
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene10.jpg
  narration: A Brazilian XCOM unit drops onto Sumatra to challenge the Kimberleys
    there. Or does it know something about aliens that we don’t? Does Firaxis need
    to start working on an XCOM in Sumatra DLC?
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene11.jpg
  narration: Sibir is a great civ too. Just look at what a cold, uninviting presence
    they are on the map. I’m cold just looking at this screenshot! I have to wonder
    what the Brazilian’s think of this part of the world.

  narration: |-
    This world is NOT going smoke-free. Nicotine hits are just required in this stressful an environment.
    Coiot‘s Note: Korean carrier salesman around the Aleutian Islands try to entice the locals, but the Blackfoot people are wise to their crooked ways.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene13.jpg
  narration: Our updated look at the Kimberley naval task force. The experts from
    CBR tell me there is no way they will make any inroads against the Australians,
    but I still am excited to know there is digeridoo music rising up over the waters
    here in the southern Indian Ocean.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene14.jpg
  narration: Somehow the Blackfoot Confederacy has a foothold in the southern Philippines.  Another
    cool modded civ, but wrong place for them to be a power. Though they do have a
    Giant Death Robot near Panuranga. Perhaps I underestimate them?
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene15.jpg
  narration: Ah the Middle East. A confusing jumble of powers in play here … that
    looks about right!
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene16.jpg
  narration: The very early struggle between the Americans and Canadians for control
    of Eastern North America was one of the things I remember from the early days
    of CBR. Pretty amusing to now see the Inuits in firm control now instead.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene17.jpg
  narration: A look at the other Australian outpost on Asia proper. Doesn’t look like
    this one will hold out much longer.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene18.jpg
  narration: Indigenous powers go to peace. Perhaps an alliance against colonial powers
    is in their future?
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene19.jpg
  narration: A look at the business pages from the local Kimberley newspaper.

  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene20.jpg
  narration: The best look at the sea of Brazilian units gobbling up space in Asia.
    No one ever told Pedro not to start a land war in Asia!
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene21.jpg
  narration: Now it is the Australians in Cebu under attack, this time from a Vietnamese
    force.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene22.jpg

    take the northernmost Brazilian Indian Ocean outpost.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene23.jpg
  narration: And then the other one falls.  As a huge fan of Midnight Oil, I can think
    of so many appropriate songs to listen to right now.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene24.jpg
  narration: |-
    This is the exact kind of issue I’d look for reviewing autoplays.  Why the carrier spam?  Time to dive back into the code and make an adjustment…
    Coiot‘s Note: More of those insufferable carrier salesman. Crowfoot better put up a massive 'No Solicitors' sign off the coast of California
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene25.jpg
  narration: 'This is a bit better look at the Middle East. Some interesting powers
    holding on here: is that both Armenia and Sri Lanka?  As well as the ever present
    Brazilians.'
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene26.jpg
  narration: The battle for Antarctic research stations.  Anyone heard anything about
    one of those appearing in a Civ game soon?
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27

- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene28.jpg
  narration: Brazil reasserts its claim in the Indian Ocean.  No wonder the cities
    in this game don’t have very high populations.
- scene_number: "29"

  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene30.jpg
  narration: 'Coiot‘s Note: No comment from Ed here but Ingolfur is throwing some
    shade at Pedro. Best watch out my friend, those carriers won‘t fool anyone. The
    Brazilian cybersubs on the deep ocean frontier will easily do away with all them
    on screen.'
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene31.jpg
  narration: |-
    And Brazilian paratroopers retake the Indian Ocean isles.
    Coiot‘s Note: Kruger however still does not join the fight, and decides to continue to watch from his Statue of Zeus in Colombo. Not much of a prize if he is not putting its massive city taking boon to use.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene32.jpg
  narration: |-
    The Boers join the fray in Oceania. A forward base perhaps?
    Reon‘s Note: Ambon once again given to the Boers in back-to-back peace deals.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene33.jpg

    here.

  scene_title: Image 34

- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene35.jpg
  narration: The Boers convince me that they like Antarctic research too. I would
    think a city down here would be nice and safe, but I’m less sure of that after
    seeing this shot.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene36.jpg
  narration: |-
    If a tile in South African isn’t under the Boers’ thumb, well then a Brazilian unit might be there. Ulundi hits 40 population!
    Coiot‘s Note: Civs definitely want to keep their luxuries since being given them again in the reboot. Can‘t blame them either, I‘d take all the incense I could take in a world filling up with sweaty, sexy Brazilians.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene37.jpg
  narration: Our first good look at the Indian subcontinent.  And who is going to
    take on Brazil’s might?  Well Sri Lanka of course!
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene38.jpg
  narration: I missed a strange power the last time we looked at the Middle East.  Why
    it’s the Finns of course!  It looks like they have exported Organic Infantry to
    the region – unlike it modern times where their best exports are usually NHL goalies.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene39.jpg
  narration: OK, this is a dramatic picture. The Sri Lanka declaration on Brazil has
    been met by a wave of incoming XCOM troopers. This could be ugly for those Sri
    Lankan fans.  And I do like their tea better than Brazil nuts, so you know who
    I’m rooting for.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40

    can’t come true?
- scene_number: "41"

  narration: |-
    We haven’t heard from the Buccaneers this installment, but Henry Morgan now denounces Pedro. Is that a good idea?  Doubtful, though the pirates seem to have some GDRs along the Spanish Main.  Quite the upgrade from the Spanish Galleons of olden times.
    Coiot‘s Note: There are 90 Brazilian aircraft in this slide alone.
- scene_number: "45"

    The quest for Sri Lankan vacation homes continues…
    Coiot‘s Note: Sri Lanka is fighting the good fight against Pedro, showing the rest of the world that a military 10000 times your size is nothing to fear.

    in the hands of the native settlers who can pronounce that!
- scene_number: "49"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene49.jpg
  narration: Korea is the first civ we announced for Rise & Fall and the one I’ve
    been testing out in recent Civ VI games. They are very good in the upcoming expansion
    and now show a bit of might here in this conflict as well!
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part101-scene50.jpg
  narration: Somehow a Hawaiian tropical paradise remains in the central Pacific.  The
    Polynesians were great for Civ V, but it’s not looking like this Battle Royale
    is giving them much room to shine.

    the same time?

  narration: Paul Kruger first came into Civ with our Scramble for Africa scenario

    he starts a new war and is eyeing the Indian subcontinent.

    There is a bit of a border between Sibir and Vietnam … just enough evidently.

    More wars breaking out. I’m still learning some of these symbols but it looks like the Blackfeet squatting in Vietnamese lands have gotten a lot more dangerous.
    Coiot‘s Note: Now for something that Vietnam cannot remove, which are these unwelcome Blackfoot units that have just let go of their 'peacekeeping' duties. The surprise DoW means these units have indeed not been kicked out and now terrorize the Vietnamese countryside.

  narration: 'Sharp-eyed observers needed for this one, so I’ll let the CBR notes
    tell the story: “As eagle eyed observers have noticed on the mini-map, the Trungs
    still came away with Cebu and Caloocan in the peace deal. The Trungs may have
    given out the most ludicrous amount of cities last album, but still show that
    their diplomatic skills have not all but vanished overnight. Unfortunately for
    them, these are all just new juicy targets for the Blackfoot. Hoi An turns blue,
    and a few more cities are likely to follow.”'

    Coiot: Global relations have really broken down of late. Look at this mess! A far cry from the lull around Part 86. Maybe someone from the sub will break this down neatly for observers back home. I of course already know a few things or two, but it‘s fun watching everyone speculate.
    Ed: That’s it for installment 101. Thanks again to the Civ Battle Royale community for letting me jump in here and be a small part of their fascinating world.
