      We begin in the forests of east central Europe. Having just gained their
      unique unit, the Spartans look poised to break out and conquer beyond the Balkans.
      Leonidas sends a settler east for peaceful expansion.

      In the British Isles, the English and Irish have been beefing up their
      militaries. Those militaries will have to go somewhere. Will it be long before
      the refrain “Stand and deliver!” rings out over the Isles?

    narration:
      In central Asia, the Mongols capture the Tibetan city of Rutog. Tibet’s
      northern cities are wide open for conquest, yet the bulk of Genghis’s army is
      pointed east, towards the red dragon. Perhaps Genghis is using Tibet as a ruse
      to direct attention away from his true intentions? Meanwhile, Songstan Gampo sends
      a settler west to expand his empire after his losses.

      Indonesia enters the Classical era. Taking a look at the area, the Champa
      city of Amravati looks like easy pickings, if Indonesia wants to get off their
      butts and expand.

    narration:
      Speaking of the Champa, both the Vietnamese and Burmese declare war on
      them. The Vietnamese look like the bigger threat, as the brunt of their army is
      bearing down on Vijaya. While Anawrahta also wields a sizeable enough force, it
      is too far away to make the immediate impact the Trung sisters are capable of.

    narration:
      In the Russo-Hunnic kitchen, the heat is highest around Kharkov. The
      Russian strategy of sending a settler to the front seems to be copped from their
      Scandinavian neighbors. The more interesting aspect is that Stalin has left the
      road to Moscow completely open, opting to focus most of his army in the south.

      A wide shot of Western Europe. The English have staked a claim on the
      Iberian peninsula, although how long it lasts remains to be seen, with Portugal’s
      not insignificant military.  Elizabeth also continues to reinforce York while
      Napoleon has his attention elsewhere.

    narration:
      In a shocking move, Stalin and Attilia declare peace. Perhaps Attilia
      realized that he did not quite have the capability to take and hold the Soviet
      core. Stalin will benefit greatly from the peace, as he can lick his wounds and
      send out the settler near Kharkov.

    narration:
      The Sri Lankans, looking to enjoy some sun and sand, settle Negombo on
      the Arabian peninsula. This is an interesting move, as it could turn into a viable
      trade city if Sri Lanka is able to hold the city. Meanwhile, the ever present
      Israeli scouts are watching, waiting, commiserating.

    narration:
      Speaking of Israel, it turns out the country’s military is not entirely
      made of scouts. Their biggest immediate threat is the Armenians, who send their
      workers south. The other nations surrounding Israel have strangely backed off;
      perhaps they are aware of the Israeli Scout’s eventual upgrade to Commando.

      In the latest installment of the Drumroll War, the Ashanti begin to send

    narration:
      On the northern front of the Drumroll War, it is the opposite situation.
      Carthage has sent its war elephants after the city of Ejura. If they capture the
      city, they very could waltz their way to Konogo if the Ashanti do not send reinforcements
      northward.

    narration:
      In sub-Saharan Africa, the Ethiopians are the lion on the savanna. Haile
      Selassie has garnered an absolutely massive military, and the cities of the Kongo
      and the northern Boer territories seem like cakewalks for the Ethiopians. Undaunted,
      the Kongo still send out a settler straight into the maw of the lion.

    narration:
      A look at military manpower. No one comes close to Haile on the African
      continent, and if he wants to expand, he needs to do so fast. The steppes are
      where the rest of the truly huge military powers reside. The Yakutians, Huns,
      Sibirs and the Timurids all have huge armies. Akbar’s army to their south is nothing
      to sneeze at either. With five of the eight largest armies, along with a surging
      China, Asia will be a quite interesting continents in the coming days.

    narration:
      "Meanwhile, the Champa and Kongo own two of the smallest armies; not
      a good sign for the Champa’s current conflict, nor for Kongo’s proximity to  Ethiopia.
      The Byzantines should take note as well; a bottom five military in their geographic
      position sells disaster. \nFinally, shame on Kamehameha and Gajah Mada for having
      smaller militaries than the observer civ."

      The Yakuts. Their massive military has room to maneuver, and juicy targets

      The Southeast Asian conflict has seen little progress. The Champa have

    narration:
      In a game of chicken, the Ashanti and Carthage have captured each other’s
      cities. Not to be undone, the Ashanti have also razed their capture. Surely the
      Ashanti are mustering a settler to replace it.

      "And you thought Lincoln was weak? O ye of little faith! \nLincoln laughs
      at your doubt, raises an army, and declares war on Texas. Perhaps this time annexation
      will not be quite as peaceful. The Americans have a tech advantage, and a size
      one. It may take a while for the full effect of the Union’s forces to kick in,
      as a chunk of his forces are up north awaiting the order to begin Operation: Fallout
      Roleplay."

    narration: |-
      Benito Juarez sits in his war room. A courier bursts in.”Sir! Lincoln has declared war on Texas!”
      His generals’ expression turns to shock. They all look at their leader; he is stoic, looking over a map of North America. He snaps. Drawing his saber, he yells “Give me back my province!” as the saber’s tip lands squarely on Austin. Thus, the long-awaited order was given, and troops move towards Austin.

      In Eastern Europe, a Spartan Hoplite column moves north. The plains outside
      of Tegea are a weak spot; the Polish cavalry would be able to run roughshod around
      the city if the gap is not closed.

    narration:
      On the flip side, the Spartans now have enough soldiers to have a shot
      at Cumae. If Cumae fell, the Hoplites have a straight shot at Rome. Even if the
      war would involve huge casualties, the Spartans could take it.

    narration:
      Perhaps Leonidas has a great deal of confidence in his troops, as he
      sends a settler to Africa. Even though he only sends two Hoplites with it, it
      could be enough to hold the city until it becomes viable.

      "Poor Gyantse. The city finally falls, spelling doom for any Tibetan
      plans to expand outside the Himalayas. \nIf the Tibetans had played their cards
      right, the city could have been a Tibetan stronghold and given them a out into
      the Indian Ocean. Then Gyantse would’ve been one of the more vital moves this
      game. But now the Tibetans are relegated to turtle status."

      perhaps, taking Dallas; Reinforcements in South America are also viable. \nIn
