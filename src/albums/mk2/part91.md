    Hello everyone, and welcome back to the Civilization Battle Royale, Part 91! I am your host,
    /u/jmangelo67 (For Dawkinzz, that is J.M. Angelo), long time lover of underdog civs and the
    head of the power rankers for the CBR. Originally the team created for MK3, we eventually got
    pushed over onto the MK2.1 project as the new Power Rankers. Here we see a tweet from Don
    Pedro II moments before bringing a hurricane to Laredo, ending Sam Houston’s career as
    Sheriff.

  narration: Here we see a tile accurate map by /u/DerErklonig (spell check that)
    and it is a nice reference to make clear who the powers are, here; however, we
    all have seen how quickly power shifts in this game!

  narration: We have another OC created by /u/Munkey_Chumbles that shows us how our
    Civball universe feels about the current changes! I quite enjoy the civballs,
    as they are a simplistic, comedic, and stylistic way to make the CBR more enjoyable
    to spread into what I may call (dare I say it?), a fandom!

  narration: |-
    As always, the Boers continue to dominate the PR. Any notion we had that the Inuit could outdo
    the Boers is overshadowed by the multiple cities and capitals that the Boers have taken away
    from Vietnam.

    After hearing that I have been granted the right to narrate, the sub celebrates a golden age,
    knowing that things will get exciting this week! For those that have forgotten our golden age
    festivities, we commonly drink champagne, dance, riot, create ARGs, and geek out over the
    BR’s future.

    The former Afghan Antarctic Bastion under Boer control is shown here, as Boer scientists are
    picking up on a seismic sonic anomaly coming from an impassable range of mountains.

  narration: Not only do we see an armada of Kimberley ships and an Australian peacekeeper,
    to the north we   can   see   that   Boer-Somalia   is   starting   to   hurt   a   bit.

  narration: Contrary to Somalia, the Vietnamese Indian subcontinent is recovering
    from its previous attacks, with Kimberley peacekeepers crowding the Indian Ocean
    so that Vietnam can keep population, production,   time,   and   military.

  narration: In the meantime, Sibir seems barely able to attack the Trungs. Nishapur
    may be safe, but it is not too likely. Meanwhile, despite Urgench being in the
    black, Sibir has no units capable of taking it while   a   clump   of   units   surround   it.

  narration: Australian Peace reaches as far as Ireland! This also gives us the opportunity
    to see most of Iceland’s military. I have been a big critic of Iceland and, whilst
    they have strong units on their land force (which at times is skimpy), the majority
    of their naval military is made of empty carriers.   Dear   Iceland   fans,   I   think   Ingolfur   is   a   paper   champion.

  narration: |-
    We also see that Australia is affected by the carrier plague, but more importantly are creating
    hovertanks and starting to fill their empty sea. I repeat, EMPTY sea. Polynesia is frankly open to
    any invader.

  narration: |-
    What is interesting is that Australia is planning a naval attack, likely on Brazil or the Buccs! This
    could be a second chance for Parkes to prove himself seeing as Brazil has had trouble carpeting
    since the reboot. Could Australia create an empire that sees three oceans?

  narration: |-
    We take a look at the former Indonesian city of Whangarei building an Autoplant! A boost to
    Australian production from any city is always good, and this just goes to show that we haven’t
    even begun to see the maximum potential of the Wobbegong.

  narration: |-
    Meanwhile, Australia’s potential victim, Don Pedro, is starting to build an air force in the
    Chilean city of Valdiva. Perhaps an air force can bombard Australia’s naval force enough to
    protect his continent?

  narration: |-
    But now for the fans of Exclavia, looking at the Afghan refuge of Batticaloa shows us that Urho
    is desperately trying to repair his fallen infrastructure and economy. Owing thousands of gold
    whilst losing city upon city to Sweden, Exclavia building a cargo ship shows just how far they
    have fallen.

    Sparta’s former capital is producing cybersubs, showing that Ingolfur might be more aware of
    his naval weakness than we realize.

  narration: |-
    Jakarta, the former Indonesian capital and nicest city under Jandamarra’s control… Or should we
    say Jandamada? An air force is being created by the Kimberley, proving that the Kimberley are
    conscious of being sandwiched between two superpowers.

    Boom. Kufah has been nuked out of existence, breaking the foothold of Somalia, if not for just a
    moment. A Lutheran Missionary makes a prayer for those lost. This goes to show that no city is
    safe, not even one deep into Boer Africa.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part91-scene20.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    Things seem clear for the perpetrators of nuclear destruction, but each city is vulnerable to
    flipping into Boer hands. The same can be said for Persepolis and Pasargadae, but the Boers can
    afford to lose those cities compared to the Trungs

  narration: |-
    The Trung atrocities do not end after Kufah, however. They bombard the former Timurid lands
    and cover the Sibir countryside in fallout. This is incredibly crippling for Sibir and their
    offensive. Kuchum Khan is lucky that Carrollton has not fallen yet.

    Sri Lankan peacekeepers are flooding into the Middle East and we see some biotroopers
    charging in from the mainland, but if we look North we can see something terrible has happened.

  narration: |-
    The walls of Jericho have fallen. An ancient Israelite city has been reduced to cinders. This
    would give Armenia the opportunity to expand for a fourth city, however! Had it not been for the
    fact Gaza is puppeted… TIRIDATES YOU FOOL!

  narration: |-
    The Boers, seeking vengeance for the many that the Trungs have killed, continue their charge
    into Central Asia. Vietnam seems to have a force at the front, but we can see that their military is
    not backed up at all. Vietnam’s carpet has dissolved.
- scene_number: "25"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part91-scene25.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    That statement is only proven here, where we can only see workers and a few paratroopers deep
    into central Vietnam. Nothing is stopping the Boers, or any nation for that matter, from tearing
    apart the southern half of Asia.

  narration: |-
    The Knights of the Maond find themselves among a swarm of Siberian carriers in what is mainly
    a useless navy, regardless of its position in the world. We do see a little rebuilding of Sibir’s
    core, which is desperately needed if Kuchum Khan wants to even have a chance of staying in this
    game.

  narration: |-
    As the International Games is passed, despite a few objections from the now deceased Sam
    Houston, Kekkonen, and Kamehameha, we get to look at the Boer core of the Sahara. Although
    it seems at first glance to be covered in units, they are all workers that are already on improved
    tiles. For once, the Boers are severely undefended. Maybe this game isn’t one sided after all…

  narration: |-
    Ecbatana falls to the Boer onslaught and Ghazni is in the black. The Hunnic workers flee their
    home of Vietnam from their Boer hunters. Honestly, Central Asia seems to be ready to fall to the
    Boers at any moment.

    Vietnam has a chance to reclaim Nishapur, but otherwise their options are limited. Meanwhile,
    Sibir continues to burn in a terrible crisis with a need to rebuild.

  narration: |-
    We can see a little unit construction occurring in Brazil, which is always nice (especially when
    you look at their Giant Death Robot in the Northwest). We also see the Australian military
    moving so far as to sit between the Boer and Brazilian continents. Also of note, the Buccaneers
    are losing more and more land through Boer settlers near Bamako.

    The last Texan Battleship continues to roam the seas and spots an Icelandic Caravel. A refugee
    points out that Iceland is sporting wooden boats,thus may be an easy target. The admiral
    chuckles at such a foolish idea, but devolves into tears knowing that his battleship cannot house a
    school to educate his people, damning all future generations.

  narration: |-
    We see that Korea has the gall to actually spawn settlers thinking they may have a chance at
    planting a city in the gaps that Vietnam’s hellfire had created. I have a feeling that that will not
    work. On the bright side Korea fans, Sejong actually seems to be pumping out a few units
    thankfully.

  narration: |-
    The International Games are finished in rapid time! The Boers doubled the production of third
    place Inuit and outdid Vietnam incredibly as well. Vietnam should not be spending their
    production on six happiness, but some people like sports enough to damn their own people to
    absolute death and assimilation into the Boer. Also of note, Mongolia gets a small win by
    gaining 3 happiness, caring enough about sports to actually try unlike every other living civ.

  narration: |-
    As the Boers finally reclaim the land they lost in Somalia, the Trungs ruthlessly nuke Khurasan
    off the face of the cylinder. If it means crippling the Boers, the Trungs must be desparate enough
    to try anything; however, I think they should concentrate any nuclear missiles on the Boer forces
    around Persia to try and reclaim Central Asia.

  narration: |-
    The Armenians slowly but surely lose their opportunity of settling a fourth city as Sweden takes
    on the old trend of Bordergore along with Vietnam and Finland. The Boers will regain this land,
    too. Tiridates, you absolute fool. You must be STRONKER THAN THIS!

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part91-scene36.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    Northern Vietnam is just as empty as the rest of it and, even if Vietnam DID have a few units
    here, Bamda is totally surrounded by Australian peacekeepers. The student has surpassed the
    master, showing that Australia can even outdo Kamehameha at his signature move.

  narration: |-
    Kuchum Khan is building an air force and I appreciate the effort, but this means nothing
    considering how far north it is and the lack of infantry units belittles their purpose. I suppose it
    could be used to destroy Tygyn Darkhan once and for all, but that is just an assumption.

  narration: |-
    Despite not being a thick shag carpet, the Buccs have a strong set of decent units! If an attack
    from Australia or Brazil comes, they can protect themselves for a small period of time. If they
    want, they can take a crack at the Blackfoot, but I do not recommend it.

  narration: |-
    Despite being the first religion founded, Australia still has not spread its religion farther into
    Japan. As much as it helps to spread it to other civs, it seems like it would be more beneficial to
    strengthen the religion in your own territory so it can spread quickly elsewhere. Case and point,
    the Boers.

  narration: |-
    Gordium falls to the Boers. This means Persia has fallen to Kruger’s cyborg armies and Vietnam
    has no chance of even defending Central Asia. I see the onslaught not stopping till Afghanistan,
    but that is optimistic thinking.

  narration: |-
    It may be safe to say that Australia is not going to attack Brazil, as they would not place the
    majority of their forces in Brazil. I think we may be seeing an assault on the Buccaneers, which
    could mean good things for Don Pedro as Australia’s forces would be cut off in the Caribbean
    for a surprise declaration. Or they could attack the Buccs as Australia evaporates their units.

    The Vietnamese prophet Christian Rosenkreuz, claiming to be the reborn Songtsen Gampo,
    seeks to spread the Theravada faith for Vietnam. For real life historical context, Christian
    Rosenkreuz founded the Order of the Rose Cross in the 17th century, based on a legend claiming
    that Rosenkreuz is the reincarnated soul of Lazarus. Interesting stuff, and I recommend reading
    about him!

  narration: |-
    Onto the infoaddict slides! Australia proves it has the largest military in the world, even greater
    that the Boers have ever been. The Inuit and the Boers are tied with military strength and we see
    Vietnam’s military has crashed so horribly that now it can only be compared to every other
    middling civ.

  narration: |-
    As far as production goes, the Boers are dominating. Most AI game hosts will agree that
    production is what wins these games, and the Boers have a lot of it. Though let us not belittle
    how much production the Inuit have. Surprisingly, Vietnam and Australia are on equal footing
    for their production. If either go to war, it will boost their production considerably if either wins.

    And here we see the Great Famine! Holy moly, if anybody can recover from a damning
    worldwide plague, it would be Kruger. Though everyone is recovering, the Boers are thriving
    and regaining every lost citizen fairly quickly.

    Can you actually believe the Boers are behind Korea, Australia, and the Inuit in tech? Of course
    they’re all first, the Boers second, Sibir a coming in strong at third, and Vietnam & Brazil on the
    precipice at fourth.

    Armenia rounds out the bottom, but Mongolia (who has been hyped as the great underdog for
    weeks) is noticeably lacking in technology. Despite their military outnumbering Korea’s and
    Sibir’s (and honestly Vietnam’s), the Mongolian forces would get shredded by their neighbor’s
    city defenses.

    We can see Lutheranism is dominating the religious world, but the Blackfoot are really plugging
    away in the Americas with Arianism. The other religions are too slow in comparison, but trying
    their best. The only exception is Dodekatheism, which seems to be going the way of the
    Ayyubids’ faith.

  narration: |-
    For reference, it looks like Armenia has been doing more converting than Australia. At least
    Tiridates has that claim to fame. The Blackfoot will easily be able to encompass the western
    hemisphere and most likely spread their faith further into Russia. Theravada is having more
    troubles, but it is doing well

    The Boers have the best cities in the world and Vietnam has the second best cities in the world.
    Hard to believe the latter is getting annihilated in its western flank by the former, but so is the
    way of the Boers. They must be stopped.
