  narration: |-
    Good day Lords, Ladies, and other assorted Gentry!
    I am your host for today, /u/lungora and today is the day we embark on another portion of the  journey of bloodshed, ruin, and death we call the MK.II Civ Battle Royale. I tend to make maps for civ on the side, cheer heavily for Champa revival, and bother you great people on our official discord server.
    I’ve got less than a day (since the last guy loljk’d out of narration ) and 77 slides of AI shenanigans, wars, and plotting that will never come to fruition, let’s get to this!

  narration: Lacsirax and Malssistra have, like every other part, put together this
    wonderful map of the Battle Royale world! Take a good look at it because it will
    never be the same again.

    open on the side of the screen so as to fully comprehend the world we‘re living
    in.

  narration: "We leap right into this part with a shot of the Mediterranean where
    a small but decently advanced Moroccan fleet fights a smaller but just as advanced
    Spartan one (who while having many more reinforcements decide to keep them far
    from the fighting). \nIn the bottom right corner a Hawaiian Engineer, lost and
    far from his homeland which he probably does not know is long shattered, inspects
    the citadel construction techniques of the Ethiopians. These will surely help
    should other civilisations ever dream of invading his prosperous home islands!"

  narration: |-
    The camera pans eastwards to the Sparta-Armenia front where Leonidas the Younger, battle hardened from millennia of warfare, personally commands his phalanxes of Great Legday Infantry out of the Holy City of Jerusalem and into the plains towards Hebron. The distinct lack of shirts on Spartan soldiers is no weakness against the machine guns that pitter-patter onto their formation, as glorious Abs of steel are better than any other form of protection.
    Carthage is seen to fall (again) to the Spartan navy in the floaty text at the top of the screen, this city is no Bilma but it’s done this a fair amount.

  narration: |-
    Oooooooh shit boys. (and girls). (and anyone else). It’s happening!
    Henry Morgan, on a recent holiday to Lisbon decided to glance south, just an arbitrary look but one that revealed so much. Standing there, erect in the old port of Marrakech stood (and stands) a gleaming lighthouse, one as great as they come. The Pirate King became jealous, called up his Finnish buddy in the north who would always be happy for another exclave, and decided to get himself some booty.
    The Buccaneers have a tremendous Atlantic fleet and a not so shabby land military either. While a vast amount of black flagged vessels are Carriers with no planes, even more are dangerously powerful advanced destroyers, long range battleships, and fleet-ending amounts of submarines. Ahmed of Morocco however has but a small navy and even less ground troops. This should be a stomp if the Pirates manage their units even marginally well.

  narration: |-
    Sale, the largest city of Morroco fed by near-endless amounts of mutated fish from its waters that come, irradiated, from the post-Mali coastline has been knocked all the way to black by the formidable 28 bombers Morgan (Buccaneers) stores in his African colonies. There’s still a bit of a carpet between any pirate units and the city, but this is a show of what’s to come.
    Casablanca has also dropped in health, falling into the lower yellows. Vietnamese peace keeping forces in the region stand in the way however.
- scene_number: '09'

  narration: |-
    An Armenian GW Infantry has managed to push past the Spartan offensive and retake Jerusalem for the pink-ish banners of his people. While not a cavalry unit, he feels bolstered by the prophet-general by his side and feels invincible as Spartans put pressure on the city yet again.
    Our friend the Hawaiian Engineer seems to have disappeared; maybe he heard of the fate of home?
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene10.jpg
  narration: 'Brave Canadian mobile SAM units storm into the Inuit city of Ikaluktutiak
    and batter at the walls of Hamilton following the declaration of war called into
    play by the Icy Walkers. They know their initial victories may and surely will
    probably not continue versing the power armoured mechanised artillery-backed invasion
    force of Ekeuhnick. I anticipate a long drawn out war with a lot of flips here,
    but with this fight and the invasion of Morocco only one thing is for sure: there
    will be a fair bit less red on the minimap by the end of the part.'
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene11.jpg
  narration: Pulling up TA_Knight’s wonderful guide to Futureworld units for info
    in another tab so I can talk about these Biodrones, here we see a unit that seems
    to be aptly described by the quote “These will wreck your stuff up to high heavens.”
    Faster, stronger, longer long, march, and terrain bonuses the inuit have apparently
    taken the beloved Canadian Loony and turned it into a weapon of mass maple annihilation.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene12.jpg
  narration: |-
    Sale has become vastly more undefended as they send their fleet against the seemingly near-invincible walls of Buccaneer Bamako. The Vietnamese desperately try to stab in the way of battleship rounds and pirate tanks to no avail, this war is going somewhere and going fast.
    To the south on Ivory coast a pirate ship lays into the defenses of Kumasi with most likely the help on no small airforce in Gao. This city too is ready to flip.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene13.jpg
  narration: A field of red, green, white, and black (including those Icelandic troops
    heading somewhere) takes up the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Northern africa.
    There actually seems to be more Moroccan than Buccaneer units, but they are also
    more hurt and may have forgotten to leave the frigate behind in the museum. Should
    the red fleet win this confrontation I can see them holding off the pirates and
    maintaining their homeland. With Vietnamese help, of course.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene14.jpg
  narration: Itazipcho, the latest stronghold of the Sioux before recent annexation
    by Canadian re-killers, has been captured by Inuit forces. There’s some brick-shaped
    boats, an awesome looking hovering thing, and a just overall a lot of intimidating
    icey units in this shot, I feel scared for Canada. Both the Vietnamese and Australians
    are here too partaking in their hobby of being annoying blokes that stand in the
    way of conflict and and the rest of the fun stuff that it brings.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene15.jpg
  narration: Boston (post-American, south), Toronto (Canadian in Michigan), Granville
    (Frozen town, north), and Regina (Flip central) have all fallen in the first Inuit
    push, turning from nice legible red and light gold into the hard to read slightly-eyebleeding
    colours of Ekeuhnick. The Canadian defense of all of these cities (or at least
    the two we can see) looks feeble at best.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene16.jpg
  narration: The Battle in the Eastern Atlantic rages on, but here comes the ARR’s
    invasion force! Embarked troops and advanced destroyers surge across the ocean
    towards the conflict (and loot). Morocco‘s (normal) destroyer fleet still stands
    in their way however, though it seems they are having a hard enough time beating
    the pirate ships already engaged. We’ll see I guess.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene17.jpg
  narration: Inuit Kamchaka, home to a few to many thousand Vietnamese soldiers is
    only out-peacekeeper’d by Yakutian Kamchatka where the Finns come in droves mostly
    because there’s nowhere else they can fit.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene18.jpg
  narration: "Casablanca and Kumasi are plundered as Henry Morgan’s troops shove well-meaning
    Vietnamese out of the way. Kumasi is a capital too, if anyone at this point can
    remember the Ashanti still it was theirs. It’s now flying a skull and crossbones
    however, and host to a large conquest party involving lots of rum. \nWe can see
    also in this shot that Raba-20 and Quar-20ate are heavily bombed, taking both
    down to hit points that just invite conquest. Alongside Tombouc-10 we can really
    see that the Cylinder is getting into this whole ‘future’ thing with their city
    names."
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene19.jpg
  narration: 'I’ve already talked about Kumasi briefly so we’re going to focus on
    the more interesting portion of this slide anyways: the fact that Vietnam and
    Finland have made peace. What started as a waay too hyped up war involving a trio
    of khans, two sisters, and an old guy in a sauna is now completely retired to
    the history books with Vietnam in possession of what was Findia and the Mughal
    ‘Empire’ before that. Who is next on Vietnam’s annex list? We can only wait and
    see.'
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene20.jpg
  narration: High tech submarines under the ice, Champa-named cities in the far Inuit
    north, and I think Charlottetown has flipped. I’m not exactly sure what the agents
    of Nebby are tryingh to point out to us here by focusing their gaze on a Vertol,
    maybe they are hoping for a pun? I am not sure. The Canadians have way too many
    embarked units hiding from the Inuit and not enough defending, especially as Sarnia
    and Victoria‘s health bars drop down to dangerously low. I’m going to vertell
    you now, this will be a bloody war.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene21.jpg
  narration: Mexicans fall from the sky into the streets of Aamsskaapipikani, a city
    I intend to never have to type again (despite inevitable flipping). Deep in the
    Blackfoot mountains and surrounded by Blackfeet (Blackfoots?) I can’t say I think
    Benito [Mexico] will hold this one long but it’s a good sign for things to come.
    Aaninin, a city I much prefer to type, to the south is also ready to be captured
    but Australian and Vietnamese forces in the region say different, blockading even
    the port with large floating siege pieces.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene22.jpg
  narration: Hamilton, an Inuit exclave, has been captured by Lester’s [Canadian]
    SAMs, who seem to have replaced infantry in the Maple Ehrmy. Regina has also flipped
    again (though it will quickly return to icy hands), and Toronto seems to have
    been bombed despite the lack of units that can retake it nearby. In the south
    we see the White Walkers surge through the Appalachians towards Albany and Washington.
    Many SAMs, entrenched in citadels, stand in their way ready for a bloody fight
    to maintain Canada’s independence.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene23.jpg
  narration: Morocco makes a push back at captured cities. A destroyer sails into
    Kumasi retaking it from the Buccaneer occupiers. Spartans are forced back into
    the sea at Carthage. The Vietnamese cry out in terror as more civilians die and
    more war is fought, more than a little hypocritical but no one said they can’t
    be. After seeing dozens of other AI games, those Boer xcoms right in view scare
    me; though that is only if the sleeping Afrikaan decides to move again.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene24.jpg
  narration: You could almost say the resolution on this world congress proposal seals
    the deal on another source of Inuit happiness and trade. Inuit clubbing now will
    have to be confined to venues with loud music and strobe lights and may not happen
    on Arctic waters.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene25.jpg
  narration: Wine is also banned, and I will try hard to not include a pun here. The
    Swedes in this shot must feel like absolute jerks now, citadeling Ravenna for
    what now amounts to a whole load of useless grapes.I’m not sure if previous narrators
    have noted it before or not but we can see here that Swedish and Icelandic Europe
    is really being teched up as Futurey building cover the once more idyllic landscape.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene26.jpg
  narration: "Rabat, Sale, Quarzazate, Casablance. Marrakech is in the red, Fez in
    the black, Braga is under heavy assault. The Moroccan fleet is shattered, workers
    jump ship to try and save their lives only to be run into the waves by Buccaneer
    warships. War is chaos, and chaos is where the pirates thrive. \nIn fitter news,
    Spartans have reconquered Carthage and are already planking over the ruins over
    the thousands of burnt homes."
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene27.jpg
  narration: 'On the island of Sicily, in the fields of grapes that feed Arrentium
    (since some idiots decided wine wasn’t bad for your liver or something) there
    lives a solitary Hunnish worker. His empire had died long ago, but he cannot remember
    it. His father’s father’s father’s father’s father’s father might, but he does
    not. The Mediterranean, Leg Day, Hoo-rah, Grapes: these are his life and all that
    he’s ever known. It is a quaint and comfortable existence, if lacking a battering
    ram and the screams of women and children.'
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene28.jpg
  narration: TPang in all of his wisdom has shown three slides here of Braga slowly
    ticking down a yellow health bar as it falls to the loot-crazed captains under
    Henry’s employ. This is the third slide and while it reveals nothing particularly
    new it’s a good spot to analyze the situation in the the mediterranean. Buccaneers
    are magic tricking Morocco out of existence, Sparta still has GWIs, and Vietnam’s
    top tourist destination is Iberia. Iceland seems to have his Eye of Sauron watching
    the whole thing from Hastings, and like usual Hawaiians are lost. Boer robots
    and xcoms to the south loom ominously in wait for a little sword clashing animation
    pitting a horn against anything on the right.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene29.jpg
  narration: Jerusalem, the Holy City of Judaism (praise YWH) stays in Armenian hands,
    I’m not sure if it had ever flipped back to Spartan control despite the large
    force of gymgoers that had been surrounding the city last time we had seen it.
    In the desert between the holy city and Gaza we can notice that Leonidas [of Sparta]
    has procured himself some paratrupers, if a bit late to the airdrop party. While
    they won’t be capturing any cities without siege support, a couple strong lads
    like these behind enemies lines can do a lot.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene30.jpg
  narration: That city with a lot of double letters and some accents has, against
    my initial assumptions, remained firmly in Mexican hands and even (I think) gain
    health while being so. Juárez [Mexico] has a lot more to fight and these mountains
    are not helping him but I think this war is definitely in his favour. I however
    am more interested in the northern front where pairs of paratroopers are parrying
    it out in the mists of Old Faithful.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene31.jpg
  narration: I did a bit of Google-Fu to try and locate any information on this elusive
    “Avro Arrow” which seems to neither have any solid stats located anywhere and
    is not one of Canada’s Unique Components. Nothing turned up besides the fact that
    it’s phased out from the most recent version of the Canada mod (which we are on
    an older one) and that it replaces the Fighter. Canada, perhaps with the help
    of this ‘Avro’ fella has retaken Boston to the south and Granville here in shot.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene32.jpg
  narration: |-
    I am actually legitimately surprised. Canada is holding the Inuit off and bloody well at that. The icy tide is slowly moving forward but valiant SAMs and… are those Great War Infantry. You know what fuck this, Inuit have Power Armour. It’s against the rules to talk down the AI so let’s look elsewhere eh?
    See those Mexican units spilling eastwards into Inuit Territory? Crazy huh, I’d like to get a shot of their core to see that carpet that just won‘t fit more units. In Lake Ontario we can also see an Icelandic scout, it’s kinda funny thinking of just how weak these guys are compared to modern units.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene33.jpg
  narration: 'Someone is bombing Arabia. I think I missed a war, and there’s no ground
    invasion to guess from. Ethiopia would have stormed in already, and I can’t see
    anything else around. I happen to be thoroughly confused. I have looked forward
    and backwards into this part and THERE IS NO CLUES ON WHO IS BOMBING MECCA AND
    MEDINA. I blame #Wollongate.'
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene34.jpg
  narration: It seems heroic Berbers have retaken most of their empire and are whittling
    the Buccaneer assault. Rabat, Casablanca, and Sale are all in christmas decor
    again. Somehow the Moroccans have distracted the majority of the visible pirate
    fleet to fight far north in Portobello, and have cleared all but a single paratrooper
    (waiting to take Fes when the turn rolls around) from their African land borders.
    Good stuff Ahmed! Any Moroccan fans in the crowd should pat themselves on the
    back for picking a team that can fight back so well.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene35.jpg
  narration: "Did somebody say pointless plotting? \nHere we can see that our spies
    are absolute rubbish and deserve to be doing something better, like saving this
    game from the inevitable return of Bolivar or something."
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene36.jpg
  narration: And another capital is down. I do not take back my words earlier, as
    the Moroccans have infantry and artillery in place to flip their capital and Rabat
    back, but the Buccaneers, now tasting the glorious extra naval movement of the
    Great Lighthouse in Marrakech won’t stop here. Paratroopers are at the gates of
    Casablanca and if Ahmed holds on to the end of this part, I can definitely say
    with confidence he won’t be here past the next. Burt now is no time for eulogies!
    No one is dead yet (except for all the countless civilian and military lives)
    and we’ve got more war to watch!
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene37.jpg
  narration: "Tpang man, help me out here. We’ve got mysterious bombers reducing the
    defenses of Arabia’s two core cities and no clues where from.Did I miss a war?
    Are the boers long range attacking but not mobilizing troops? Is there a glitch
    in the game doing this? \nOn another befuddling note, Sparta is still unable to
    retake the Holy City."
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene38.jpg
  narration: |-
    This is definitely the same turn with no changes from early, but we get a look at what remains of the Moroccans. Casablanca is ready to fall to eyepatch’d fighters, Tangier the new capital has no terrain defenses and little defense; and Utique, a former Carthaginian city, hosts planes, hills, a mountain, and should let Morocco hang around a fair bit longer even if/when they lose everything else. Unless Ethiopia declares war, of course.
    Oh! Braga has fallen, I missed that. Good stuff Henry!

  narration: |-
    Playing a string note on his Sintir, Morocco’s greatest and last (probably) musician floats off into the Atlantic southwards with his troop of bodyguards. They are in search of Asylum in Brazil, and failing that: Chile. Workers man a fleet of ships as a wall to save their fleeing idol. A pointless attempt really, as pirate ambushers get to the instrumentalist anyways. His ship would be sunk by noon that day.
    Despite the will of the Vietnamese African Peacekeeping forces, the day has been won here for the Buccaneers and lost tragically for their foes.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene40.jpg
  narration: Back to Canada we see that nothing has flipped or been captured. Several
    more cities are at lower health and Inuit forces on the screen appear slightly
    more fatigued, but otherwise this war grinds on. Lester Pearson smiles on behind
    the scenes thinking that I have forgotten he’s fighting with Great War Infantry
    tech; this is wrong, I do not forget.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene41.jpg
  narration: I know I vertold you this war would be bloody, but I think I sit corrected.
    It’s just going to be slow and my lack of creative narrative (in the way of story,
    i like to think I’m at least making the facts interesting) will sadly slow it
    down further maybe. Ekeuhnick has more units in position to slowly extend his
    fronts forward, but it’s a war against a turtle and I think the icy team is sleeping.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene42.jpg
  narration: "How do they keep doing it? Well, I say that but then we can look at
    the less than satisfactory amount of pirate troops in the region and realise that
    Al Mansur [Morocco] even without the endless reinforcements, has them outnumbered
    on the home front. \nI THINK the boers are increasing their xcomn density in this
    region, but they’ve always go so many units it is hard to tell."
- scene_number: "43"

  narration: "A paratrooper, Spartan and proud (Hoo-rah!), stands at the gates of
    Jerusalem, parachute fastened into a makeshift yet epic cape that blows in the
    wind behind. Bombers and batteries have opened up the city‘s (lack of) walls to
    his entrance, all it takes is another step and a short massacre and the city will
    be his, and his king’s, Leonidas’. \nHis brothers to the north at Hebron are engaging
    in the glorious act of siege too, flexing and squatting while their support helicopters
    slowly rocket down the walls (that do exist here) of the city down. They also
    have awesome parachute capes and this makes the GW Infantry jealous."

  narration: "Holy bombers batman. The Finns it seems are preparing for round two
    and have brought backup, the Paratruupers this time around will fall from the
    sky from the wings of devastating and hard to see aircraft, rather than slings
    like traditionally. \nEDIT: UPDATE: URGENT: BREAKING NEWS: I have gained news
    from our lord and saviour Nebby the all powerful and all seeing that these are
    what are attacking the Arabians. The Finns are the ones attacking. This makes
    so much sense. Now for a ground invasion?"
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part58-scene45.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot seem to have reengaged their defense drives and are aiming
    to take back Aamssk+. Historians should call this moment the Fiesta Offensive,
    and while not as successful as OTL’s Tet Offensive (and somewhere completely different)
    it’s still doing something, I think. Inuit Mdewakantonwan seems to be the central
    battlefield for this war, with both sides having open borders to duel it out on
    the cold windswept plains. Bombers float overhead here in runs to destroy buildings
    in Hunkpapa, but it will be a long time, if ever, for the Blackfoot troops to
    push all the way down there in an organised fashion.

    And the most bloody war of the CBR yet has come to a close. After a long, grueling. and rather terrifying if I do say so myself, offensive, defensive, and all the other -fensives we can finally call it quits. Ethiopia has made peace with Korea. Thank Akatt-U that is over.
    Reevaluating the Arabian scenario with the knowledge they’re fighting Finland, we can see that the few planes Al Rashid has, in Najran, are bombing Batticalosomething slowly but the lack of units fighting on either side will just leave us hurt cities and nothing more.

    and time to wonder how they continue to not lose and why Sparta literally cannot
    even. Maybe Leonidas III is a teenage girl?* I can’t say. What I can say is that
    at least Armenia built some units at all, they used to be only civilians and a
    couple artillery now we’ve at least got an army now even if half of it is in the
    Black Sea next to the Last Legion. \nTalking dead civs and their units we can
    also see the remainders of the French, and an Indonesian scout chilling in frame.

    We return to Morocco for a pleasant view of what remains of the once rather large green-on-red empire: citadels and sand. A settler tries to go somewhere, but it is surrounded on all from by now-Buccaneer cities. Carriers block the strait of Gibraltar but they are being bitten into by submarines.
    I know how I talked about a final musician earlier, but I at that point I had assumed that the other two here would be dead already. Assuming is bad kids, don’t do it and stay in school.

    New Ireland Lake is a nice little place, home to the raft-dwelling people that refer to themselves as “Scouts”; some type of long lost tradesman class perhaps? They make Ahahpitape a popular tourist attraction at least, even if North America and the world may have forgotten what they are and were.
    From the Blackfoot borders around Aamsk+ I have to say it’s flipping and has been flipped. At least it’s at 1 pop and no more people will die, right?

    has reflipped and Sarna has been taken. That Avro chap was in Sarna though, wasn’t
    he? (she?) well, RIP I guess. Last war the Canadians had a solid battery of artillery
    on this peninsula that kept the Ice Sheet Fleet at bay and Canada safe(-ish) from
    harm, this time it does not exist and instead we just get more SAMs.

    Isles, home to an advanced army of Cybersubs, quick and long range murdertubes;
    Arsenal Ships, hailing from Holloway London; and the Advanced Destroyers we all
    know and love. Sweden’s navy and army is in tip top shape too, rivaling Iceland
    very well, even though I still do see a small amount of wooden boats.

    to annex. Marrakech flips again back to the plucky West african almost-dead underdog.
    Henry Morgan’s [Buccaneer] land forces seem to have sat still in favour of either
    trying to defend current lands or just because they’re kinda lacking, and the
    Moroccans are still going. Rabat looks to fall as well, but the Pirate fleet is
    right there so I hope that AA gun doesn’t get too hopeful.

    a strong force in from their Texan lands to bolster the fight and the Northern
    front is looking even more and more one sided too. The Canadian core becomes even
    more sparse.

  narration: The Trung Sisters [Vietnam] don’t want their Northern neighbour to get
    it on with nobody else but them. Such a fight would be hilariously one sided,
    one side being a carpet of doom and the other the Boer-impeded Mongols. All that
    is required it the Sisters to make up their minds to fight, assuming they know
    themselves.

    One AA gun remains as Morroco’s last melee unit. The rest is either civies or artillery and machine guns, and so few of those too. If only the Buccaneers had more than a 6th of the Troops Vietnam has in their new Moroccan territory.

    of normal Infantry, I laugh at all the SAMs, their tenacity is inspiring, the
    Inuit picked a slow fight to fight, and I could really do with some more bloodshed
    in the region. Also: Australians seriously go home there’s no shrimps, barbies,

    The Boers in their transhumaness make some crazy sounding Gene Vault thing, I’ve got no idea what it does right now but in a couple of slides we all will!
    Honestly I’m surprised at how tame this carpet appears, sure we’ve got hovertanks and robots but most of it is just paratroopers. The city defenses are the actual terrifying part when I come to think about it, just compare these 150s with Ethiopia’s >100s above. Whoever ever takes on the boers needs some hella strong cannons.

    TPang obviously has some sort of Vertol fetish I think, maybe just the Inuit ones but it’s pretty undeniable.
    Winnpeg and Ikalukutiak are in the red and ready to flip, and Saskatoon to the north is Canadian again. Has anyone been counting Boston flips? I haven’t and I’m curiously now it’s like every time we return here that it’s got a new owner.

    I mentioned that Mexico probably has a carpet earlier, this shot proves me wrong it seems. They have so few troops that I bet that second plotting is Sri Lanka also looking at this land with smiling eyes and a meekly-sized force of riflemen. Not that far, but you get what I mean.
    But look up there at A’aninin! There is no more Aussie UAV in the way and instead a Mexican tank rolled up at the doors.
