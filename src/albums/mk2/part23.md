  narration: "Hello ladies and gentlemen, redditors and… redditors, to the /r/civbattleroyale!
    This is the sport where we watch 61 AIs brutalize and murder each other just for
    fun! I am your narrator /u/Wigmaster999.\nFirst off, I’d like to thank TPang for
    letting me narrate this part, it’s a huge honor. I’ve been writing various OCs
    on the subreddit, but this is what I’ve aspired for since the Mk. I. \nRemember
    to check out /r/civbattleroyale for all things Battle Royale, such as fictional
    stories, polandball comics, random flags and artwork, and lots of maps."

    is really All Hallow’s Eve… does that mean that the day this is published is Hallow?
    Yep, it does."

  narration: Without further ado, let us begin. The Australian Wobbegong Armada strikes
    again, taking Tokyo down to 0 health and damaging every other Japanese city. Korea’s
    intruding turtle ships are perhaps the only things saving Meiji [Japan] from the
    full force of Australia. There doesn‘t seem to be much of a way to turn things
    around for the Japanese at all.

  narration: |-
    The First Relevant War of Yakutia heats up as the Inuit send more forces to defend their Kamchatkan holdings. While the Inuit have the upper hand in terms of navy, the Yakuts are on home ground and are sending streams of melee units to engage. It’s a shame that the mountain ranges are almost entirely blocking off a land invasion, or perhaps we’d see a valuable city like Igloolik besieged on all sides.
    Side note here: Are those Buccaneer Triremes? Perhaps they’re searching for the lucrative Russian Vodka to add to their alcohol stores.

  narration: |-
    Here, we see the glory of the English Empire: 3 cities, two of which are damaged [the third isn’t even on the Isles]. Ireland recaptured Canterbury at the very end of last part, and Malachy looks poised to use his navy to stomp Nottingham as well. It won’t be long before London is the last holdout of Elizabeth on the British [Irish] Isles.
    In other news, Maria [Portugal] and Haakon [Norway] appear to have sent a portion of their navies to fight Nazi Germany. Norway gets there first, and captured Cologne. Perhaps Hamburg is next?

  narration: |-
    China makes another push with quite outdated units. Vietnam continues to defend and not attack Beijing [which sits pretty at 17 population], and so is basically giving up free cities. However, knowing Vietnam, I know that when China FINALLY makes peace, they’ll probably give up Shanghai for free.
    Chile and Ireland both admit that they really don’t like Korea, but Sejong just nods and carries on studying. The entire nation has been enslaved by the brutal leader and forced to spend 12 hours per day reading books to increase their nation’s science.

  narration: |-
    Peaceful, sleepy Chile. The Inca would have been a better target than Korea, considering that Pachacuti’s [Inca] navy is composed of mostly triremes. This opportunity may disappear quickly, however, since we now see the first evidence of Galleasses. Perhaps Argentina, with exposed Buenos Aires, could be attacked? Neither of these events will happen considering Higgins’ AI so far.
    On this slide we can also see what is likely the third wave of the Hawaiian diaspora. With absolutely no room on their home island, poor Hawaiians are forced to sail away on Banana Boats and serve Pina Coladas to South Americans.

  narration: |-
    Portugal continues to welcome guests to their territory. England and Morocco both have generous holdings on the Iberian peninsula and at least England would be a good target. The Buccaneers have now reinforced their transatlantic colony of Portobello, adding a crossbowman and two caravels to its garrison.
    Ingolfur [Iceland] is sending his navy… somewhere. He isn’t at war with a single person, but perhaps he’s plotting against someone? Orleans [France] is also damaged and it may be captured by Norway or even Portugal.

  narration: "The Timurids appear to be running out of units. Fighting a brutal war
    of attrition against Persia, Afghanistan, and the Huns, I don’t think that they’ll
    be lasting much longer. Ghazni may be retaken, but Persia is likely to take it
    back due to the open deserts around it. The Huns push from the north and the Afghans
    push from the south, and Timur is slowly, slowly losing ground. \nAlso on this
    slide: Armenia has entered the Industrial Era! This might give them an upper hand
    against their enemies, and a gatling gun could come in handy fighting the Spartans.
    Meanwhile, that’s quite a Finnish army up there…"

  narration: |-
    Here, we can see the full expanse of the Blackfoot Empire. Crowfoot’s in an unfortunate position, now that the Sioux aren’t a buffer between himself and the great powers of Texas and Canada. Crowfoot can hold out pretty much forever in California, but all of his other holdings are at risk. In the meantime he has managed to make peace with the Sioux, which should help him. Right.
    The Inuit cities are absolutely massive, most of them larger than the Blackfoot’s largest cities. However, Ekeuhnick’s lands are mostly devoid of military units since they’re all in Kamchatka, leaving most of them ripe for the taking. Will any of the other great civilizations attack when they’re weak? Probably not. AIs will be AIs, after all.

  narration: |-
    The Kamchatkan standoff remains pretty much identical since the last time we saw it. However, Tygyn no longer has to worry about Vietnam, since he has successfully made peace with the Trung Sisters. Instead, he only has to worry about the literally infinite streams of units pouring out of Alaska, and the fact that his units are dying in the thousands to Inuit archer fire.
    The Ayyubids are now on neutral terms with the Maori, but far more relevant is that Sparta and Armenia have finally stopped killing their armies by throwing them at each other on Asia Minor. No doubt that Leonidas [Sparta] has his eyes on other conquests, and Tiridates [Armenia] is probably busy building factories.

  narration: "Here we can see the delicate balance of power in Madagascar and South
    Africa. The Boers have a massive, if outdated, navy that could easily take the
    Zulus at any time. The Zulu cities of Nongoma and Ondini are practically free,
    and I’m sure that Ulundi, the Zulu capital, would be just as easy to take. \nAfrica
    itself is at peace, at least on this turn. Everything is calm and quiet, and yet
    each superpower broods and grows."

    I’ve been walking across this country for days, and yet Kruger’s holdings don’t
    seem to end. \nToday, I heard about a European scout in the north by the name
    of Dr. Livingstone who is hanging around the Kongo. Apparently, he’s going south,
    and maybe I’ll meet him.\nOtherwise, yet another day of helplessly fleeing the
    evil Ashanti killers. Maybe I should join the workers without borders program?”"

  narration: |-
    Poland loses another city to the Finns. Casimir’s [Poland] armies are now running on nothing but fumes, and all he has left is a few pikemen to face Urho’s [Finland] far more advanced musketmen, lancers, and cannons. However, there may be hope for Casimir: Wroclaw may be retaken by that… spearman. SPEARMAN? HOW DO YOU STILL HAVE A GUY HOLDING A TWIG FIGHTING AGAINST CANNONS!
    At this point I think Poland deserves to die. Next stop, Warsaw! Toot Toot! In other news, Sejong [Korea] and the Buccaneers are going head to head. Considering Henry Morgan’s AI so far, he’ll manage to do nothing at all and then make peace in exchange for all of Korea’s cities.

  narration: "Now that the Buccaneers are at peace with the Maya, the dastardly pirates
    turn to building some rum distilleries and chopping some trees. I think this is
    the least exciting slide I’ve ever seen that involved Henry Morgan. \nThe Hawaiians
    have made permanent camp around Palenque, making it utterly invincible to any
    outside attacks. The kind of strings Pacal must have pulled to make this happen
    must have been insane. However, Pacal’s not gonna be safe for long as Sam Houston
    finally sends out his navy and army to capture Tikal."

  narration: |-
    The Trung Sisters decide that freedom and equality are both overrated, and go for Autocracy. This should give them the boost they [didn’t really] need to fight Burma, China, or Tibet, and move on to control all  of East Asia.
    Now, I shall pose a simple question: Why has Mao been able to push off practically infinite waves of far more advanced forces? Why has he constantly lived on, even though he lost most of his empire long ago? Nope, it’s not because his attributes are insane or his AI is super-smart. It is simply because the Trung Sisters constantly decide that the best way to attack is to embark all of their units.
    Side Note: In the very corner of the screen one can see that the Mughals have actually sent units across all of Afghanistan to attack Vietnam. Yet another problem that Vietnam doesn’t know how to deal with.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part23-scene17.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    Here we can see the sheer willpower of Akbar [Mughals] to become relevant. He has sent his units trekking across mountain ranges and Afghan territory in order to weakly fall against the walls of Vietnamese cities. While we can’t actually see most of the action in this picture, I’m sure that’s what is happening.
    Timur [Timurids, do I really need to specify this?] has actually managed to push a troop of three crossbowmen onto Afghan territory. I personally doubt that they’ll make any difference, but who knows? The Persian city of Ghazni continues to hold out against the final Timurid swarm, and once this final wave is dealt with Darius’ armies will be able to roam free.
    Meanwhile, Tibet is finally getting in on the action and has besieged Urgench. With little chance of reinforcements, Tibet may be able to push all the way down to Samarqand and beyond. Timur’s days are numbered, I’m sure.

  narration: |-
    London looks ready to bite the dust. The insanely powerful longbowmen could only hold out for so long against Ireland’s army, and now, finally, the capital will fall. Nottingham is damaged as well, and without bombardment support from London it will probably be captured without trouble. The British Isles should practically be renamed the Irish Isles now.
    Also on this slide: Malachy hates sleepy Yakutia, who couldn’t care less. It’s yet another irrelevant war that Tygyn will endure, and forget about, for centuries. Iceland’s navy has overflowed its borders, and now looks quite imposing sitting there.. until you realize that that navy has been sitting there for literally millennia.

    I hate Yakutia! You hate Yakutia! Everyone hates Yakutia! Yaaay! Mexico, Canada, and the Maya all join the hate parade, and Tygyn Darkhan is getting slightly annoyed by the constant shouting of heralds telling news of war. He just wants a nap, after all.
    The North American superpowers are all looking around for new targets. Texas has Pacal [Maya] to snack on, but Canada and Mexico are looking hungry as well. We all sit waiting for the next North American gangbang.

  narration: |-
    Pedro’s university workers, after intently staring at a jungle tree for 3 years, have obtained just enough science to magically invent Industrialization [or something similar]. With this tech boost, they may finally be able to take Machu and the rest of Pacathui’s Incan territory. Alternatively, Argentina would also be a good target for attack.
    Random Tangent: Why on earth does an AI need that many workers? They could cut down the entire Amazon rainforest in a few decades.

    The Ayyubids are slowly getting squashed. Saladin has only now entered the Renaissance, putting him solidly in the bottom third for technology, and at rock bottom for strategic position. I’d even venture to say that China is doing better than they are right now.
    The unstoppable waves of slightly-more-advanced Carthaginian elephants have had their toll on Hannibal. He, also, does not have a longswordsman. But he does have elephants. What could go wrong with more elephants? Bilbais is ready to fall and Alexandria is next. How much longer can Saladin survive against battle elephants?

  narration: |-
    The first city capture in the Kamchatkan standoff is that the Yakutians take Sendai. Wait, didn’t Sendai originally belong to Yakutia? Or the Inuit? The life of a narrator is confusing.
    Anyways, Yakutian frigates continue bombarding Ekheunik’s northern cities. The exact same thing is happening to any of Tygyn Darkhan’s ships that slip through. Barely any progress is made, but it is important to keep in mind that this war could tip the balance of power in not just the region but the world.

    are thinking about?”\nSeriously, though. Iceland could practically walk into Rouille
    with no resistance from anything other than triremes. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER, ICELAND!
    As a firm Iceland supporter, this is the kind of things that drives me crazy.
    The entire Canadian navy could be defeated by a fraction of the forces stationed
    around Greenland. \nTexas continues to be not messed with [to Sam Houston’s dismay],
    and Mayan units have managed to make it all the way up to Washington. What they’re
    doing there? Only a Firaxis AI developer could say."

  narration: |-
    Timur, seeing that he should wrap up some loose ends, decides that his best course of action is to make peace with Stalin [Russia] and Meiji [Japan]. A better choice for peace at the moment would be Darius of Persia, considering that the Timurid horde has finally taken Ghazni. However, Ghazni itself is likely to be retaken at any time by a single Persian pikeman.
    The Timurid army is now on the retreat, and the majority of units are damaged. They’ve formed a circle of protection around Herat, but let’s see how long that will last.
    On this slide we can also see more Mughal units creep across Afghanistan, and see that Tibet has decided to retreat with most of their forces. Why? Because Tibet does whatever the hell it wants.

  narration: |-
    Here we see an extremely HD picture of the Finnish making peace with Atilla of the Huns. It has been a long and tiresome war for both sides, but it’s quite obvious who came out better off: Finland. Atilla is down to the last dregs of his Horse Archers, which are ever so slowly becoming out of date.
    Helpfully highlighted on this slide by our Lord and Savior TPangolin is the new Finnish unique unit that I won’t even try to pronounce: the Jaakari [+umlauts and lots of other fancy indications that I can’t type]. The Jaakari is cheaper and weaker than the rifleman, but gains experience just by standing in territory belonging to a friend. This could come in handy with the Finnish war against the Huns!.. wait a minute.

  narration: "A full zoomout of the dwindling Hunnic war. Now that he’s at peace with
    Finland, Atilla can turn his full attention, and his army, toward Siberia. Sadly,
    Atilla’s full attention consists of a gaggle of damaged swordsmen, a couple of
    trebuchets and knights, and half a dozen horse archers. \nSadly for Atilla, Sibir
    has its full attention focused on the Huns. And Siberian attention is a bit more
    formidable: dozens upon dozens of UUs, musketmen, gatling guns, pikemen, and a
    bunch of other things just perfect for destroying Hunnic cities. Oh boy! Bakihon
    looks likely to fall, and Atilla’s Court is starting to lose its buffer of units."

    He hurriedly packs his few things, and flees his own home,
    Meiji knows, after all, that he’ll end up like Rome.
    Just as he leaves, the Australian army now lands,
    And Tokyo’s last inhabitants each take their final stands,
    But they do not prevail, and Tokyo does fall,
    And with them falls Meiji,the smartest of AI them all.
    The Japanese still have holdings, but how long will they last?
    None can withstand a frigates cannonball blast
    There’s no hope at all for Japan, and that’s a sad thing indeed

    Back to Back Poem Eulogies Hype!
    Queen Elizabeth of England sat idly by,
    As Malachy colonized all of the lands nearby,
    She ignored the Portuguese as they tried to take Hastings,
    And gave York to the French, not wanting to waste things,
    Queen Elizabeth sat upon her throne as the Irish invaded,
    She read a book, while the Icelandic then raided,
    She took a calm nap as Canterbury fell,
    And ignored her own final funeral bell,
    She sent out a few longbowmen to combat Malachy’s army,
    And watched as they died, as if it wasn’t alarming,
    Finally, when the Irish came knocking on her door,
    And informed the queen that they had come for her,
    She simply cried out, “This took you forever!”
    Then proceeded to remark on the bad weather,
    She was carted away, while all wondered what she talked about,

    Poznan was retaken a while ago, but I’m surprised it hasn’t been recaptured by the Finns. If only that knight could just swoop in and take back the city. Warsaw itself is contending with a musketman, which is already quite a challenge for the technologically impoverished civilization. They’re also dealing with the Nazis, who have sent a little invasion party to attempt to take Lodz.
    Also, there are a few relevant things on the sidebar: Mexico has entered the Industrial, joining the growing ranks of coal-puffing [probably autocratic] civs. Canada and the Blackfoot are now buddying up, and perhaps Crowfoot is ready to start the next NA gangbang?

    *Yawn* Yet another slide of the Kamchatkan standoff. Wotjulum is ready to fall, and Ikaluktutiak continues to remain at the exact same health. Otherwise, no changes at all to this war.
    However, it’s important to remember that since Japan is quite quickly crumbling, Australia might be able to free up some of its armada to go help the Inuit. They’re already at war with Yakutia, and Henry Parkes can probably snipe off a city or two.

    A single embarked longbowman is the only English unit in the English Channel. Nottingham, while not visible, is pretty much certain to get captured, and then the British Isles will be united under one flag: Ireland. However, in the Mk. I England under Churchill already controlled the entire British Isles from the start, along with lots of Greenland and Iceland, and yet Churchill was still one of the weaker civilizations. Ireland won’t be much better off with just the isles.
    Side Note: Wouldn’t it be funny if the Nazis recaptured Cologne, and then all those Naus took it?

    Sri Lanka in all of its glory. It’s got quite a navy of irrelevant triremes building up, but quantity has a quality of its own. With this many naval units, Sri Lanka could probably overwhelm Persia or Burma easily.
    Colombo is massive considering it shares 7 tiles with another city. The delicious deity AI bonuses are probably helping quite a bit here, as with all honesty a city that a player controlled with that much population, controlling only 3 or 4 tiles,  would be absolutely starved.

    Moscow is slowly getting surrounded by Finland. Now that Poznan has been recaptured, Wroclaw is controlled, and San Bartolo is solidly protected, the USSR is blocked off on three sides. Once Warsaw is captured, the only place the Russians can flee to is… Byzantium. Thus, the situation that Stalin is in.
    Outside of Minsk is an impressive amount of Citadels, but these will give no help in defending Moscow itself. Instead, they’ll just slow down an invading… Byzantine force. Right. Definitely going to happen.  Speaking of the Byzantines, they’re still running on horsemen and composite bowmen.

    Greenland has become more of a naval base than anything else. Since most cities are pretty much capped out on population [if only Iceland has the same UB as the Inuit!] the only thing they can do is provide a constant stream of caravels and galleasses.

Lodz is already besieged, Poznan not far behind, and with both likely to fall Poland will be down to two cities.
    Now we come to Hitler’s Germany, which isn’t doing much better than their neighbor. With their territory nearly devoid of military units, that invasion force in Denmark could probably wipe them out.

    It also strikes me at this time that Brazil is one of the only civilizations left that still has a good amount of forest or jungle left to chop down. By the end of the BR, the entire world will be an utterly deforested landscape [and also will likely just be a nuclear wasteland].
