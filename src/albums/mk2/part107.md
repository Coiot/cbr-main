    Hello and welcome to another truly extraordinary episode of the Civ Battle Royale Mk. 2.1! Your host today is /u/Admiral_Cloudberg, r/civAIgames mod and contributor to CBRX, happy to come back for a second shot at narrating the CBR after being stuck with a filler part last time. And I can say with high confidence, this part is anything but filler.
    We begin with a piece of OC that is in fact a map: the wonderful Vihreaan Hand-Drawn Map by /u/Vihreaa. Like the other map artists, his map brings a unique style of drawing that allows us to see the world in a slightly different way.

  narration: And we also have our usual installment of /u/DerErlenkonig’s Tile-Accurate
    Map, which is just the thing you’re looking for if you want to figure out whether
    Brazil controls your hometown yet.

  narration: The power rankers once again put Brazil unanimously in first place, and
    there is little reason to doubt this decision. It seems that every part, Brazil
    absorbs more and more of the world. Now, let’s get to the action!

  narration: Right on, jumping straight back into the second brutal Brazil-Boer war.
    It can be very hard to keep track of what’s going on here, but by my analysis
    it seems that Pedro has captured Gades and Olympia since we last saw this region,
    several slides before the end of part 106. Brazilian advanced destroyers did the
    bulk of the heavy lifting in those captures, while the Boers respond with a counterattack
    made up of roughly 50% robot infantry and 50% biotroopers. Has Kruger finally
    decided on the perfect blend of man and machine?

  narration: "Brazil has made important gains in... wait, did someone say GAINS? That’s
    right, Brazil has captured Dvin! With the critical canal now under Brazilian control,
    it shouldn’t be long before Pedro locks down the entire coast of North Africa.
    Not to mention that Brazil can now draw on the power of Leonidas and his magnificent
    loins. \nBrazil has also captured the minor Boer in-settle of Isafjordur, with
    is a minor footnote next to the fall of Dvin."

  narration: On the battlefield between Sibir and Mongolia, Genghis Khan has managed
    to hold onto Mandalgovi by virtue of Kuchum Khan’s decision to put his ranged
    units in the way of his melee units. Genghis did not have any such luck at Shaoshan,
    however, which has returned to Sibir’s fold, at least for now. As a fun side note,
    check out how bleak the area around Khoro looks—this city strongly evokes images
    of Noril’sk, Russia’s factory city above the arctic circle. Now imagine if Noril’sk
    was home to 21 million people, and you have a pretty good idea of the hellscape
    that is Khoro.

  narration: |-
    Over in the Gulf of Mexico, all seems to be quiet in the battle between the Buccaneers and the Blackfoot. Henry Morgan recovered Maracaibo near the end of the previous part, and no more Blackfoot units are headed his direction. That said, Morgan isn’t sending a counterattack beyond a fierce aerial bombardment of Austin, so it looks like this war might just end with what most people predicted: a stalemate.
    Further to the west, The Inuit-Brazil war also appears to be winding down, as Pedro struggles to reach Guadalajara and Laredo through all the Blackfoot peacekeepers.

  narration: Another turn rolls by, and Brazil captures yet more cities from the Boers,
    including Kumasi, which a long time ago and in a galaxy far, far away was an original
    capital. However, an enormous Boer fleet comprised mostly of cybersubs escorting
    embarked units is forming off Messina, and an even bigger carpet of biotroopers
    and robot infantry is building in central Africa. This might be the first screenshot
    we’ve had in a long time that features more Boer military strength than Brazilian.

  narration: Over in Egypt, Aswan appears to have been bludgeoned off the face of
    the cylinder, though it’s hard to say who was responsible. This is also the first
    time we’ve seen Sparta this part, and I’m happy to announce it’s back in Icelandic
    hands! At least Ingolfur will get to keep something, even though Pedro has taken
    most of Iceland’s former cities for himself.

  narration: In Arabia, Brazil has recaptured Najran, which recently flipped back
    to the Boers, and has also taken Nova Iguacu. Ironically, Nova Iguacu is a Brazilian
    city name, but the city was founded by the Boers after they exhausted their city
    list. So does that mean it has met its rightful owner for the first time? Hard
    to say.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene11.jpg
  narration: 'Eagle eyed viewers—well, okay, almost everyone probably—might have already
    seen the peace declaration between the Buccaneers and the Blackfoot on previous
    slides. But this makes it official: no cities changed hands in the war, although
    Austin and Petit-Goave took quite a bit of damage and almost everyone in Maracaibo
    was killed.'
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene12.jpg
  narration: The Australia-Korea war is still ongoing, but it seems to have settled
    into a back-and-forth battle over Kyoto. But with Korean melee units having vacated
    the premises, this might be the last time we see the city in Sejong’s hands. What
    at first looked like a promising invasion of Japan has left Korea fans sorely
    disillusioned, but if Sejong keeps buildings units, he may eventually be able
    to force his way back into Japan.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene13.jpg
  narration: Okay, I know you’ve seen it already. But I will address the elephant
    in the room when we get there. What this slide shows is that Brazil has taken
    Konongo with the help of another wave of XCOMs, while that huge Boer force that
    we saw earlier has mostly failed to materialize near the front.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene14.jpg
  narration: 'In Arabia, Brazil has captured Medina, Basra, and Bethlehem; only Mecca
    itself holds steadfast in the face of the technicolour tide. Also of interest:
    Brazil has some biotroopers coming out of Baghdad, the first of their kind we’ve
    seen Brazil field in battle. (They’ve had some in their core for a while, but
    they never seemed to leave.) And what’s that? You’re distracted by something?
    Yes, we’re getting there...'
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene15.jpg
  narration: By some miracle of diplomacy, Korea has... wait what? Yes, it’s Australia
    who initiated the peace treaty, allowing Korea to keep Kyoto. That means Korea
    actually won the war, having gained one city out of it. At this point, if Henry
    Parkes wants to win wars, he should wait for other civs to declare on him, because
    clearly offensive wars aren’t working.

  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene16.jpg
  narration: |-
    Okay, finally, we see it: YES, THE BLACKFOOT HAVE DECLARED WAR ON THE INUIT! Despite being next door neighbours, the Blackfoot and Inuit have literally never gone to war at any point during the 1050 turns of this game, choosing instead to remain best buds... until now. And up until recently, few suspected that it would be the Blackfoot who would pull the trigger. It has been hotly debated whether the Blackfoot, who have a larger army that is nevertheless very outdated, along with a production base an order of magnitude smaller than the Inuit’s, could beat them in a war. At last, however, all speculation is swept aside, and we will find out for real.
    However, Crowfoot has done this in almost the smartest way possible: in coalition with Brazil. Now, you say, wasn’t Brazil already at war with the Inuit? Didn’t they make peace this very turn? Ah, yes, but diplomacy shenanigans have taken place. Brazil made a pact with the Blackfoot to declare war on the Inuit after giving them ten turns to prepare (you all know the diplomacy option). But while the pact was still in its infancy, the Inuit preemptively declared war on Brazil. But the two sides made peace before the 10 turns had been reached, allowing Brazil to sneakily circumvent the peace treaty by accepting the Blackfoot invitation to begin the planned war. It actually works; you can try it yourself.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene17.jpg
  narration: Another potential obstacle for the Blackfoot is that a significant portion
    of their army and navy is over here by Mililani. They need to get it to the mainland
    ASAP if they want it to count in their struggle against the Inuit. This does raise
    the question of why all these units are over here in the first place—was Crowfoot
    planning an attack on Australia? We may never know.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene18.jpg
  narration: Up in far eastern Siberia, Blackfoot overseas forces have begun their
    fight against the Inuit colonies in Asia. Although some Inuit cities are taking
    damage, the Blackfoot units here are too few and too outdated to have any hope
    of penetrating the mountainous and heavily-defended terrain in Kamchatka and Chukotka.
    At best, this front will serve as a distraction for the Inuit, and a poor one
    at that.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene19.jpg
  narration: 'In the heartland of North America, things may be a different story.
    Blackfoot units are pouring into Inuit lands, damaging multiple cities, most notably
    Corpus Christi, which is in the yellow. The Blackfoot also have air superiority:
    I count 39 Blackfoot airplanes in this shot and zero Inuit planes. But it’s important
    to keep in mind that the Inuit have not made their move yet, and a lot of Blackfoot
    units—especially damaged ones—can easily be killed in one hit by some of the future
    worlds units the Inuit are fielding in admittedly smaller numbers.'
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene20.jpg
  narration: In what we know as the southern US, the story is similar. The Blackfoot
    have made a strong initial push, damaging several cities, but the viewer accustomed
    to AI games will know that the force here is woefully insufficient to make any
    progress. Another noteworthy development is that the short-lived Inuit-Brazil
    peace treaty has forced all of Pedro’s XCOMs out of this region, eliminating a
    force that could have been of major assistance to the Blackfoot.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene21.jpg
  narration: But despite the action in North America, things are still happening elsewhere
    in the world. We can see in this shot that Brazil has captured Mecca, adding yet
    another capital to Pedro’s already extensive repertoire while also uniting all
    of the Arabian Peninsula under a single ruler for what I believe is the first
    time ever.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene22.jpg
  narration: We quickly return to shots of the Inuit-Blackfoot front, this time after
    another turn has passed. Up here, Blackfoot forces are making a heroic push against
    Michmash and Qamani’tuaq, but a large force of Inuit biotroopers and robot infantry
    is lurking just behind them to launch a counteroffensive as soon as Reon presses
    “next turn.”
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene23.jpg
  narration: On the Great Plains, the Blackfoot are still pushing hard, laying siege
    to Mdewakantonwan and pushing hard against four or five other cities. Jaffna is
    actually all the way down to black, but the Inuit have surrounded it with a ring
    of powerful units to block the nearly-dead Blackfoot paratroopers from capitalizing
    on the bombardment.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene24.jpg
  narration: 'Over in Africa, peace is declared between the Boers and Iceland. Really,
    both civs lost this war; the Boers took several cities from Iceland, only to lose
    them immediately. Like what so often seems to happen these days, all the gains
    went to Brazil. The Boers do get one last parting gift out of it though: the 6-pop
    city of Isit, which has barely any tiles and will fall to Brazil almost immediately.
    Congratulations, I guess?'
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene25.jpg
  narration: In Africa, Brazil continues conquering cities left and right, seemingly
    unfazed by that large Boer army that we saw a few slides back and is now nowhere
    to be found. In this turn alone, Pedro has captured Mampong, Ciudad Guayana, and
    Kongo Dia Nlaza. Remember the days when Mambong was unassailable? Those days are
    no more.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene26.jpg
  narration: Down on the coast, Brazil has captured Denkyira, and it really looks
    like that elusive Boer counterattack has either been mostly destroyed or has retreated
    into the their core. There are a fair amount of units around Anziku and Loango,
    but less than before. I can only ask, what are the Boers doing with these units?
    It seems like they should be able to pump these out and push forward to start
    recapturing cities, but Brazil just keeps going and going and going...
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene27.jpg
  narration: In Australia, it seems that Henry Parkes has almost completely carpeted
    his core with biotroopers and robot infantry. Almost all the Brazilians who were
    here embarked into the sea during the attack on the Kimberley, freeing up all
    this space for Parkes to finally build an army worthy of his reputation in olden
    days. For the first time since they declared war on Vietnam, Australia has a unit
    carpet, but will it be enough to pull them out of their doldrums?
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene28.jpg
  narration: Brutal winter trench warfare continues in Siberia as Genghis Khan cedes
    Kazan to Sibir, but continues to make sure that every front line city is bombed
    to zero HP. But Kuchum Khan has struck back, launching nuclear attacks on both
    Hsia and Karakorum. With the front free of Brazilians and with Sibir now playing
    the nuclear card, Genghis Khan’s days are surely numbered.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene29.jpg
  narration: Back in the so far indecisive Blackfoot-Inuit war, we are reminded that
    Crowfoot has some large cities in the Aleutian islands. 41-pop Ahkaiyikokakinik
    (please please please never ask me to spell that again) has already fallen to
    the Inuit, and Kiy is sure to follow. This is a big blow to the Blackfoot, because
    one can only imagine how much science these cities were generating, even if they
    were doubtlessly low on production. Also worth noting is that the city-that-shall-not-be-spelled
    did not lose any population when it was captured, meaning that the Inuit are culturally
    influential over the Blackfoot.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene30.jpg
  narration: In Blackfoot Mexico, the situation appears to be turning a little bit
    away from Crowfoot’s favour. He has nearly captured Puebla, but his nearby melee
    units will be killed on the next turn. Some Australian and Brazilian units also
    block the way, all but ensuring that if anyone captures Puebla, it will be Brazil.
    The Brazilian units flooding Blackfoot territory will provide a boost to their
    strength, but nevertheless, Crowfoot is failing to seriously damage most of the
    border cities, and the Inuit have now conjured up at least 40 airplanes and are
    using them to bombard core Blackfoot cities into the black.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene31.jpg
  narration: Back over by the Red Sea, Brazilian XCOMs are beginning to flood into
    the Horn of Africa, capturing Helsingborg and Holualoa. The Boers have managed
    to recapture Medina, however, momentarily breaking Pedro’s unification of the
    Arabian Peninsula. What strikes me as odd here is that I don’t see any Brazilian
    planes on the front lines, yet there must be some nearby, or else they’d never
    be able to eat through cities this quickly. However, the range of stealth bombers
    is so long that they could very well be stationed in Europe and still bomb this
    area, so it’s no surprise that Pedro hasn’t moved them near the war zone.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene32.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot war against the Inuit has allowed Brazil to finally move
    some XCOMs in and take Guadalajara, while Crowfoot has managed to capture Laredo,
    marking the first Inuit losses of the war I’m going to start calling the Buffalo
    Hunt. (Yes, I know they’re bison. Shhhh...) The White Walkers have been kicked
    out of Mexico except for some heavily besieged cities in Baja California, although
    Australian peacekeepers are starting to pour into Mexico—de ja vu much? We saw
    the exact same thing happening during the conquest of Mexico way back before the
    hiatus.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene33.jpg
  narration: Up in Egypt, Brazil has taken Hippo Regius and Cairo, netting Pedro yet
    another capital (I believe that brings him to 17 capitals total, which is more
    than a quarter of the original capitals he needs to win. I have to say, I never
    really imagined that a civ would reach this point, and yet here we are. Note the
    planes (likely stealth bombers) in Olympia—this is probably the leading edge of
    what has to be a very large air force.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene34.jpg
  narration: The tide seems to be turning in the Buffalo Hunt, at least up north,
    as the Inuit capture Kutaimik and push hard on several other Blackfoot border
    cities. Crowfoot is now almost entirely on the defensive, having failed to seriously
    damage any Inuit cities in this area, and now his entire army around Tsúùtínà
    and Ipoksimaik has all but vanished. You know I’ve been saying Blackfoot border
    cities, but the problem for the Blackfoot really is that almost all their cities
    are border cities and are therefore vulnerable.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene35.jpg
  narration: Crowfoot is also in trouble in the Gulf of Mexico, where his army is
    almost gone and Austin has flipped. Brazilian XCOMs and paratroopers are beginning
    to make their way back into the southern US, but none pose a serious threat to
    any cities yet, except maybe Puebla, which is somehow still in the hands of the
    Inuit.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene36.jpg
  narration: Jumping back to Egypt again, Brazil has taken Bilbais and Harar, though
    the latter is almost certain to flip. Pedro has also retaken Medina, ensuring
    that there are no orange splotches in his beautiful Arabia. The Boers clearly
    have a decent air force here, but by my reckoning it looks like they’re using
    it to bomb cities in Arabia rather than killing Brazilian units. This may be a
    fatal mistake on the part of Paul Kruger.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene37.jpg
  narration: The Inuit march into Austin, and this time they keep it! Laredo has also
    flipped again. On the front lines in Texas, Brazil seems to be doing the heavy
    lifting against the Inuit, pouring XCOMs into the area around Austin while the
    Blackfoot are only able to field a handful of paratroopers. But so far, there
    still aren’t enough XCOMs to make a major dent in Ekeuhnick’s forces, and all
    the Australian units hanging out here are not exactly helping. I can respect Parkes’
    efforts to enforce peace, but this is the CBR and we like WAR!
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene38.jpg
  narration: The hammer seems to be falling on the Blackfoot core as the Inuit capture
    Tsúùtínà and bombard just about every other city, including their capital
    Síksikáwa, down to red or yellow. Crowfoot has retaken Kutaimik and captured
    the Inuit city of Mdewakantonwan, but probably not for long, as their hold on
    almost every city in this slide is becoming rather tenuous. Seeing this now, it’s
    hard to believe that so many of us argued that the Blackfoot could win this war.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot have also captured Torreon from the Inuit, which they will
    keep for now as the huge Ice Sheet Fleet off the California coast doesn’t have
    any melee units. It also must be asked what those Brazilian XCOMs think they’re
    doing. Guys, the Inuit are over there, you’re in the wrong place!
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene40.jpg
  narration: 'Brazil makes more enormous gains in Africa, taking Ejura, Kwilu, Turinsk,
    and Baalbek. The next line of cities is already in major trouble as well. Also,
    take the time to look at the minimap and absorb the enormity of Brazil’s conquests
    in the old world. If those conquests comprised the entire territory of a civ,
    they would probably be ranked #1.'
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene41.jpg
  narration: The golden age that began in Babylon on the previous turn has now ended,
    which seems odd consider that hype levels are currently through the roof. Note
    also that not even Antarctica is safe from large numbers of powerful Brazilian
    units—visible here are XCOMs, biotroopers, robot infantry, arsenal ships, and
    advanced destroyers. This is a good unit composition if I ever saw one.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene42.jpg
  narration: Back in Mexico, the Inuit have taken Laredo and recaptured Torreon, but
    are struggling to prevent Austin from falling to Brazil. Ekeuhnick moves before
    Pedro, however, so he might still have a chance to kill those XCOMs. As for the
    Blackfoot, however, things are looking just as grim as before. Not only have they
    failed to take Puebla, but their cities are all being bombed into the red and
    yellow, protected more by Australian peacekeepers than by their own units. Their
    main saving grace is their air force, but they’re using it to damage Inuit cities
    they can’t reach instead of killing the units that are amassing on their borders.

  narration: Farther north, the Ice Sheet Fleet, accompanied by a large contingent
    of melee land units. Aapahtosipikani is just barely hanging on, and Siksikawa
    is in serious trouble as well. The once expansive, if not might, Blackfoot carpet
    has almost completely evaporated.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene44.jpg
  narration: The situation is similar in Africa, where Brazil has captured Atebubu
    and Dire Dawa. At this rate, it won’t be too long before Brazil completely conquers
    the Boers, which would be... quite something. I honestly can’t believe this is
    happening.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene45.jpg
  narration: In Ethiopia, Brazil has also taken Safi, Axum, and a city whose name
    I can’t read because the end is off the edge of the picture. Still, this is a
    dismantling on an epic scale, and I feel like I’m watching history here. Real
    history. There are honestly no words, which is why my commentary on these slides
    has gotten quite short.

  narration: At last, Brazil takes another city from the Inuit. It’s Torreon, the
    city that the Blackfoot and Inuit had been flipping back and forth for a bit.
    There is only one half-dead Inuit melee unit nearby too, so it might stay Brazilian
    for a while.

  narration: An enormous Inuit unit carpet is descending out of the north like some
    kind of sluggish tsunami, capturing Aapahtosipikani and Tsinksistsoyik (and probably
    more cities offscreen, too). Several Inuit biotroopers stand at the burning gates
    of Síksikáwa, preparing to seize the capital of their last remaining rival in
    North America.

  narration: Indeed, not only has Tsinksistsoyik fallen, so have Ipoksimaik and Káínáa,
    and Hunkpapa has flipped. The entire narrow strip of Blackfoot territory running
    northeast from Síksikáwa is now in Inuit hands, which seems to have proven right
    those who said that Blackfoot territory was not defensible when surrounded by
    the Inuit on so many sides, no matter how big Crowfoot’s army was.

  narration: At last, the Blackfoot have captured Puebla, but it’s too little too
    late. The Inuit carpet has gone from only mildly concerning to downright apocalyptic,
    as Ekeuhnick churns out units at an unprecedented rate. And those units are easily
    tearing through the tiny handful of Blackfoot units that remain, while Brazil
    doesn’t seem to be contributing much in the way of assistance.

  narration: In the name of Nebuchadnezzar, this is insane. Brazil has taken Bloemhof,
    Hartingsburg, amd the legendary Funniest City on the Cylinder, Klerksdorp. Not
    laughing now, are we? Brazil has also nuked the city of Virginia, and if there
    were ever any Boer units in this area, there definitely aren’t now. I count just
    16 Boer land units, compared to 77 fielded by Brazil. How could Kruger let this
    happen? Did someone unplug him from Skynet? Has Mini Pedro sabotaged the servers?

  narration: For the first time in a while, we get a good look at the Sibir-Mongolia
    war. Interestingly enough, no cities have changed hands since the last time we
    saw it. Sibir does have a bigger army on the front lines now, however, while Genghis
    Khan’s doesn’t appear to have increased or decreased significantly. That said,
    Khoro has lost a lot of people, but it’s still comparable to Noril’sk if Noril’sk
    had 6.5 million people.

  narration: This slide is a mixed bag for the Inuit. Ekeuhnick has retaken Puebla,
    but has lost Austin to Brazil, giving Pedro yet another capital. And the Blackfoot
    have managed to sneak an advanced destroyer into Waipahu, although the city should
    flip back very clearly. But I know you’ve already seen the sidebar notificaiton...

  narration: That’s right, Síksikáwa, the Blackfoot capital, has been captured by
    the Inuit. And it’s not just Síksikáwa; the Inuit have also captured Hunkpapa,
    Mdewakantonwan, Aamsskaapipikani, and Sikopoksimaik. (OH GOD MY EYES, WHY DID
    I HAVE TO SPELL THOSE...) Anyway, at this rate, if it weren’t for his Pacific
    colonies, Crowfoot might actually be facing elimination.

  narration: In what used to be Texas, Oglala has flipped, but otherwise the only
    change is that there are somehow even fewer Blackfoot units than before. And for
    whatever reason, Crowfoot is still using his air force to bomb cities. When will
    he learn?
- scene_number: "55"

  narration: For the first time this part, we are faced with an Africa screenshot
    where the Boers have more cities than they did the previous turn. Kruger has recaptured
    Safi and Klerksdorp, but given the number of Brazilian troops closing in on this
    area, it’s not clear to me that this is anything other than a momentary bump as
    Brazil speeds toward total victory in Africa.
- scene_number: "56"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene56.jpg
  narration: In the Horn of Africa, Axum and Holualoa have flipped but are back in
    Brazilian hands. Brazil doesn’t exactly have a huge number of troops in this area
    though, and the terrain is about to get seriously rough. If there’s anything that
    stops Brazil, it might be this, but I definitely wouldn’t bet on it.

  narration: |-
    Oh, here’s a fun distraction. Australia has reformed Catholicism, which is the majority religion throughout much of East Asia. I can only imagine what a religious reformation might look like in the far future. Perhaps there’s been some edict on whether robots can go to heaven?
    Also of note is that Henry Parkes has fully carpeted Japan and is beginning to spill units into Korean territory. That’s interesting that the two civs have open borders.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene58.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot are being whittled down into a narrower and narrower strip
    of cities as the Inuit claim almost all of the west coast. They’ve captured Áánin
    and Torreon, locking up most of California, and it looks like they have a biotrooper
    in place to flip Monterrey on the next turn as well. That will be a devastating
    blow, because the city is home to 10 airplanes, an artillery, and a missile cruiser.
    There’s no chance for the Blackfoot to move them or kill the biotrooper either,
    because the Inuit move first.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene59.jpg
  narration: Since Australia reformed its religion, here’s the religion overview.
    Parkes has selected Underground Sect, which causes his spies to exert religious
    influence in the cities where they’re stationed. This is unlikely to affect the
    game in any meaningful way, but it’s fun to imagine Australian spies covertly
    implanting Catholic thoughts directly into the brains of the cylinder’s futuristic
    cyborg citizens.

  narration: 'Brazil has rounded the corner of West Africa and entered Central Africa,
    taking Messina, Loango, Kavanga, and Zabid in a single turn. I can’t restate it
    enough: this is absolutely unbelievable. This truly is the weirdest timeline.'

  narration: Sibir makes another push into Mongolia, capturing Darhan, but for some
    reason most of Kuchum Khan’s army is idling well behind the front lines. It’s
    worth noting that most Brazilian units have vacated the area, although some remain
    further back—perhaps they left to fight the Boers? There are also a few Inuit
    units engaged in a skirmish with the Brazilian peacekeepers near Mandalgovi.
- scene_number: "62"
  scene_title: 62
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene62.jpg
  narration: What’s this? Brazil sweeps up into the gulf of Mexico with renewed fury,
    retaking Austin and capturing Gonzales as well. Neither city looks like it will
    stay green for long, however, as Brazil doesn’t seem to have brought any reinforcements
    to the area, they will probably flip back pretty soon. And Ekuhnick has captured
    Mexico City from the Blackfoot, even as a few Brazilian XCOMs try to steal that
    city away as well. (Keep in mind that in this game, Ciudad Juarez is the Mexican
    original capital, not Mexico City.)
- scene_number: "63"
  scene_title: 63
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene63.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot capital has apparently moved to the island megacity of
    Mililani, where most of what remains of Crowfoot’s army has congregated in a giant
    flotilla of sadness. Note that the Blackfoot still control Honolulu, but I guess
    Mililani is bigger. Also note that the actual biggest city in Hawaii is Hilo,
    which has reached 50 pop under the bountiful rule of Henry Parkes, putting it
    among the largest cities in the world.
- scene_number: "64"
  scene_title: 64

  narration: Brazil finally takes Caesarea, uniting the entire Red Sea under Brazilian
    control at last. That said, Pedro’s progress in this region has snowed down markedly
    as terrain gets in his way. But with more conquests incoming in the west, he could
    eventually choke the Boers out of the mountains of Ethiopia.
- scene_number: "65"
  scene_title: 65
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene65.jpg
  narration: Here’s a view of the... what’s this sea called anyway? Well, I’ll call
    it the Sea of Harrismith, in honour of a city that was once enormous but has somehow
    fallen all the way to 18 pop. There are few Brazilians to be seen in this area,
    and plenty of Boers, which just goes to show that Kruger still has a large and
    productive core even if he’s lost more than half his cities to Brazil at this
    point.
- scene_number: "66"
  scene_title: 66
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene66.jpg
  narration: The end is nigh for the Blackfoot, at least on the mainland. The Inuit
    have now captured Monterrey, Oglala, Ahahpitape, and Los Angeles, leaving just
    two besieged Blackfoot cities in North America (it appears as though Ciudad Juarez
    has fallen off screen as well). Who could have predicted at the end of part 106
    that the Blackfoot would be reduced to a few scattered islands in part 107? I
    certainly would have been skeptical.
- scene_number: "67"
  scene_title: 67
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene67.jpg
  narration: Indeed, a broader look at Mexico reveals that the Inuit have taken Ciudad
    Juarez, while Brazil has captured Mexico City from the Inuit. Ekuhnick has recaptured
    Gonzales but has failed to do the same for Austin, ensuring that Brazil’s presence
    in North America remains for now. Also, the Blackfoot still hold Waipahu, meaning
    that they have three cities still on the mainland... for now.
- scene_number: "68"
  scene_title: 68
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene68.jpg
  narration: As usual, Brazil is also making progress in Africa, where Pedro has captured
    Matamba, Virginia, Gondar, and Klerksdorp. I have to say, the city of Virginia
    looks out of place here. And it definitely isn’t virgin anymore...
- scene_number: "69"
  scene_title: 69
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene69.jpg
  narration: Holy cow! One turn later, Brazil has completely broken through the wall
    in Ethiopia and taken almost every city here in one fell swoop. That includes
    Bloemfontein, Klein Vrystaat, Etchimadzin, Harar, Addis Ababa, Mek’ele, and Adama.
    If the Boers do not make peace soon, I could actually see them being reduced to
    a rump state or even eliminated. This is really beyond anything I could have imagined.
- scene_number: "70"
  scene_title: 70
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene70.jpg
  narration: But, as you might have seen on the previous slide, Brazil has called
    off its war with the Inuit after making only minimal gains. Ekuhnick remains in
    possession of Austin and Mexico City, while Brazil keeps Laredo, Guadalajara,
    Uxmal, and Therapne. It’s technically a win for Brazil, but the Inuit gained so
    much from the Blackfoot—including three capitals—that they’ll scarcely notice
    the loss.
- scene_number: "71"
  scene_title: 71
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene71.jpg
  narration: The war with Brazil may be over, but the Buffalo Hunt isn’t. Seeking
    to clean up what little remains in North America, Ekehunick captures Wahpekute—home
    of Petra—and makes a valiant attempt to squeeze past all the Australians and take
    Veracruz.
- scene_number: "72"
  scene_title: 72
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene72.jpg
  narration: 'Another view of East Africa reveals that Brazil has captured Adwa, home
    of Lake Victoria. Once upon a time, the natural wonder might have been worth something,
    but not there are many future worlds improvements that provide just as much food,
    and buildings that provide even more. Also featured in this slide: one of the
    last remaining significant stretches of forests in the world. Most of the world’s
    forests were cut down by the civs, leaving only the patches with deer or truffles,
    but many of those have since been nuked off the map. But not these—this is a primordial
    forest, possibly the last on the cylinder. And for the first time, possibly ever,
    it will soon see the horrors of war.'
- scene_number: "73"
  scene_title: 73
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene73.jpg
  narration: 'With an ignominious whimper, the Blackfoot are expelled from North America.
    The Inuit have taken Veracruz despite Henry Parkes’ best efforts to preserve Blackfoot
    sovereignty, and now the enormous army of the white walkers stretches almost unbroken
    across the continent. One must wonder: will Ekeuhnick try to seek out the last
    Blackfoot strongholds in the Pacific, or will he call it quits and turn his attention
    to another weak neighbour? Will the Buffalo Hunt continue until no more bison
    remain?'
- scene_number: "74"
  scene_title: 74
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene74.jpg
  narration: The Inuit appear to be bombing Honolulu with stealth bombers, which suggest
    Ekuhnick may be considering an aquatic invasion. But without a significant detachment
    of the Ice Sheet Fleet, Blackfoot Hawaii will probably remain secure thanks to
    the very large flotilla still hanging around Mililani, Crowfoot’s capital-in-exile.
    But we will see where this war goes in part 108, because it is now time for our
    end-game statistics review.
- scene_number: "75"
  scene_title: 75
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene75.jpg
  narration: In population, Australia holds the top spot thanks to the downfall of
    the Boers, but Brazil is rapidly catching up. Pedro’s cities are not large, he
    just has an awful lot of them. In fact, Brazil’s population has increased by almost
    100 million just since the end of part 106.
- scene_number: "76"
  scene_title: 76
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene76.jpg
  narration: 'In production, Brazil is undisputed king, with 9,000 more hammers than
    the #2 Inuit even though most of Pedro’s conquests are still puppeted. The Boers,
    who once seemed so unstoppable, have fallen to 7th—below Korea, but still a hair
    above Iceland.'
- scene_number: "77"
  scene_title: 77
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene77.jpg
  narration: Brazil’s military manpower, however, has suffered a drop of over 4 million,
    or 40%, while the Inuit have almost doubled their soldier count. If Pedro insists
    on conquering the rest of the Boers without spending some serious time and energy
    replenishing his forces, he might actually lose his top spot in military.
- scene_number: "78"
  scene_title: 78
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene78.jpg
  narration: The religion overview shows that the newly reformed Catholicism has spread
    via brain implant to over 220 cities. Unsuspecting citizens will periodically
    wake up to discover that they became Catholic during the night and that the “uninstall”
    button is grayed out.
- scene_number: "79"
  scene_title: 79
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene79.jpg
  narration: Unsurprisingly, Brazil now has the most wonders, while the Boers still
    cling onto 10, including Skynet. It was often said that Skynet was the most important
    wonder still in the game, but it doesn’t seem to be helping them much. Maybe it’s
    having issues? Do all the uploaded citizens just see an 8-bit blue screen with
    a cutesy Skynet logo and the words “Skynet is down for maintenance?”
- scene_number: "80"
  scene_title: 80
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part107-scene80.jpg
  narration: |-
    And lastly we have the religion map, which reveals the true extent of Catholicism. Australia has covertly converted almost all of Eurasia to its religion, which has spread as far west as Sweden and as far east as Alaska. One place it has not spread, however, is the Australian core, which remains a firm mix of Theravada and Atheist. Blackfoot Arianism, meanwhile, has spread to virtually every city in the Americas and has nowhere left to go.
    Anyway, that’s all for today! Thank you all for allowing me to narrate this frankly shocking episode, and I’ll see you in the comments!
