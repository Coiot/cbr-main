    Hello everybody, it’s MSurdej, Power Ranker and Boer technocrat, here to bring you another exciting part of everyone’s favorite AI Game!
    Last part we saw the Boers declare war on Sparta, much to the dismay of Mallock of Dvin(shown above). Will the Boers assimilate Sparta, or shall Tuesday remain leg day?

  narration: Next we have a beautiful map created by /u/ Spherical_Melon, detailing
    the countries of the cylinder and the size of their cities. Many cities of the
    major powers have taken a hit in population since the reboot, which might give
    some underdogs a fighting chance.

  narration: Lastly, we see the Boers still hold onto the top spot, though their deviation
    continues to grow, as many have doubts on the Orange Menace. WIll Paul kruger
    be able to prove them wrong? Let’s find out!

    The part opens with Australia making peace with Brazil, ending the Australian influence on South America. Pedro now controls nearly all of South America, with only a few Buccaneers holdout cities standing between him and complete control. But it seems that he has moved his land units back towards the mainland, with the intent of capturing Huamanga and its Uranium deposit.
    Meanwhile, mad that he lost his top 10 slot on the Power Rankings, Genghis decides to declare war on Tibet, to prove us all wrong about his conquering prowess.

  narration: Meanwhile, Swedish vertols attack the Finnish city of Oulu, with SAMs
    and Power Armor  awaiting further instructions. Kekkonen meanwhile has only a
    lone pair of Mech Artillery defending the city, while a naval blockade on Gdansk
    is being challenged by the Swedish navy

  narration: Further south, Helsinki finds itself in similar trouble, with Swedish
    troops crossing the Baltic Sea to launch dual attacks on the Finnish capital and
    Wroclaw. Yet once again, Finland has few troops to meet the invaders, only having
    5 military units in this slide.

  narration: In a citadel near Minsk, a long forgotten Pikeman watches on as things
    get even worse for Finland the closer to the Equator we get, as Ponzan and Adrianople
    fall to the Swedish army. While Ponzan looks safe for now(besides the constant
    bombardment it and Corinth are receiving), Kekkonen has the chance to retake Adrianople
    if he can get his melee ships into range.

  narration: "We all knew it was coming...With a mighty robotic foot, the Boer GDRs
    take Jerusalem and Epiduaros, ending the reign of Leonidas once and for all.\nOh
    Sparta. You were the first to take a capital, the first to eliminate a civ, and
    while you never reached the top spot (you peaked at 5), you will always be #1
    in the hearts of many a shitposter. \n“Now cracks a noble heart.—Good night, sweet
    prince, And flights of angels, Who never skip leg day, sing thee to thy rest”\nF"

  narration: Back in the Middle East, Sibir sends a small force to Ghanzi, intent
    on taking it back. The mountainous terrain and Finnish exclaves make this war
    a perpetual meatgrinder, but it is hard to say when, or even if, a decisive blow
    will be dealt. To the west, Bukhara rebuilds its walls as Tiridates III plots
    his next move.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene10.jpg
  narration: Further East, the Sibir hold the city of Nishapur, with the Vietnamese
    looking to capture the city yet again. While Vietnam has more units, a majority
    of these shown are UAVs, which cannot take cities,giving Kuchum Khan the slight
    advantage.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene11.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile, an Inuit cruiser laden with nuclear missiles makes its way
    towards Australian America. Few but the Australian Air Force hold  the city, and
    while no melee White Walkers are in enemy lines(the nearest is chilling near Monterrey),
    a few well placed nukes could bring an entirely different sort of Winter.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene12.jpg
  narration: Inuit forces continue to surround the city of Uxmal, though nearby units
    of Ekeuhnick’s forces remain battered from their recent conquers. Meanwhile, the
    Buccaneers begin to rebuild as well, their Central American holdings recovering
    as their time in the war seems to draw to a close.
- scene_number: "13"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene13.jpg
  narration: Sweet Whistling Lutefisk! One turn later, Gustavus manages to capture
    Helsinki, giving the Swedes another capital and forcing Kekkonen to retreat to
    an undisclosed location. The Lion of the North proves he’s playing for keeps,
    and continues to move his men further east, giving pursuit to the Finns.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene14.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile in Qashliq, Kuchum Khand decides that plowing through Vietnam
    to get to tibet is a fool’s errand, and makes peace with Songstan Gampo. While
    the city is still reeling from the nuclear blast it took a few parts ago, The
    Sibir continue to fight the good fight.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene15.jpg
  narration: Sejong comes to a similar notion as The Sibir, and makes peace with Tibet
    as well. While this would be a good thing for Tibet, Ekeunhick and his gopher
    neighbor Blackfoot declare war on them in the same turn. While this will probably
    amount to nothing, with Crowfoot’s legendary sniping skills, anything is possible.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene16.jpg
  narration: In the former Yakutian lands, Ekeuhnick plot to move further west, and
    attack Kuchum Khan. While such an attack would probably not amount to much, it
    could make diplomacy with the Trung Sisters more amiable.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene17.jpg
  narration: Speaking of the Trungs, they seem to be plotting against Jandamarra,
    hoping to take the former Indonesian islands for themselves. While borders are
    currently open between the two countries, an invasion could bring relevance to
    a usually quiet area of the cylinder.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene18.jpg
  narration: Back on the Finno-Swedish front, Oulu still holds while Gdansk looks
    to be in good shape. The Finnish navy meanwhile, continues to sail around, not
    risking attacking the few Swedish ships in the Arctic Circle.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene19.jpg
  narration: The heat of the action is seen here though, as Gustavus marches on Minsk,
    nearly bringing the city to its knees in a single turn. Kekkonen meanwhile, has
    retreated to Moscow, where he is almost certainly in Stalin’s old bunker, helping
    himself to his former rival’s vodka stash, wondering where it all went wrong.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene20.jpg
  narration: The south of the battlefront remains the same however, with the Finnish
    navy in the Black Sea bungling a possible recapture of Adrianople.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene21.jpg
  narration: Ghanzi falls back into Sibir’s hands, and Vietnam seems poised to take
    it back in a matter of turns. Armenia can only watch on as the two powers vie
    for control. There is little Tiridates II can do, but rebuild, re-arm, and wait
    for the eventual next fight.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene22.jpg
  narration: With a few turns under our belt, we send our spies to various new cities.
    Iceland and Brazil are the most interesting to see while Armenia and Finaldn will
    be good to watch how civs on the chopping block are faring.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene23.jpg
  narration: Back at Oulu, Sweden looks poised to take the city the following turn,
    provided the Power Armor Infantry doesn’t die. From there, Gustavus could either
    move to take Jyvaskyla or Vantaa, and there is little Finland can do to stop them.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene24.jpg
  narration: While Espoo takes some damage, Finland is so devoid of units that Gustavus
    is brazenly sending Vertols deep into enemy territory.  All the Finns can do now
    is ready their air force, hole their artillery in their cities, and pray to whatever
    god they lost in the revival that Sweden offers peace terms soon.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene25.jpg
  narration: Unsurprisingly, little changes to the south of the battle for Finland
    and Sweden, but what IS surprising is that Vietnam ahs open borders with both
    Finland and Iceland. If the Trung Sisters move against Gustavus, it could spell
    disaster as the southern borders of Sweden are exposed.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene26.jpg
  narration: Finland has a pair of hovertanks left over from the Armenian invasion
    stuck in an exclave while the main countryside is ransacked. Ghanzi flips back
    to Vietnam, and Armenia, despite the best efforts of BluCasette, builds a carrier,
    proving that not even our benevolent gods can suppress the might of Armenia
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene27.jpg
  narration: To the East, Nishapur holds, with the Trung Sisters moving forces east
    to re-take the city. This massive game of Reversi, flipping a few border cities
    between Sibir and Vietnam, has been a massive drain on both countries, but has
    effected Sibir much more than the Sisters.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene28.jpg
  narration: 'Bamda flips back to Vietnam, though the way to the nearest Sibir city
    is blocked by the two greatest forces of this war: mountains and Finns. To the
    east, Mongolia’s carpet is severely underdeveloped, but still a force that can
    give a sparsely defended country like Sibir a run for its money.'
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene29.jpg
  narration: Back in North America, Waihapu falls to the Inuit, leaving only two cities
    in Parkes’ hands this side of the Pacific.Meanwhile, Crowfoot seems to have given
    Ekeuhnick Open Borders, allowing the Inuit to waltz through his lands.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene30.jpg
  narration: Further south, Inuit forces move in on the last Australian city in Central
    America. Parkes has ships and planes in spades, but the lack of melee units means
    that Australia will undoubtedly lose their American holdings if this continues.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene31.jpg
  narration: Speaking of ships, a contingent of the Australian Garbage patch is shown
    here, with a large number of carriers surrounding Coff’s Harbor. Whether the fleet
    of paratroopers are heading or fleeing to North America is uncertain, but it might
    be too little, too late.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene32.jpg
  narration: In perhaps the ballsiest move since the Mk2.1 started, Sweden moves in
    on not one, not two, but three different cities at the same time. Lappeenranta,
    and Moscow go to yellow, while Kekkonen flips Minsk back to his control for the
    time being. While Swedish melee units aren’t in range to recapture, its unlikely
    Finland will hold Minsk for long the way Sweden is going.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene33.jpg
  narration: Drunk off his rocker, Kekkonen orders a Hovertank to recapture Adrianople.
    When his advisors tell him that is impossible, he throws an empty vodka bottle
    at them. Meanwhile, it seems that Sweden has Open Borders with Iceland, who in
    turn has given Vietnam free passage as well.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene34.jpg
  narration: As we move into The Levant, we see Vietnam has also gained open borders
    with Armenia, who has continued to re-arm itself, making another carrier. Everybody
    seem to like Vietnam, as opposed to their exclave Tibet, who just got war declared
    on it by Yakutia.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene35.jpg
  narration: Nishapur holds, and it seems that Sibir has a slight advantage in this
    situation. The old Timur capital of Samarqand is unpuppeted, allowing Sibir to
    churn unit after unit out. Whereas most of the cities along this front are puppets,
    with Lahor the sole exception.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene36.jpg
  narration: Bamda flips back to Sibir, though with the amount of Vietnam units in
    the area, a reverse flip could very well be seen. Cities on Vietnam’s side are
    also puppets, with only Old Sarai being the only non annexed Sibir city shown.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene37.jpg
  narration: You know what isn’t puppeted though? Vietnam’s core, which still has
    troops to spare(albeit a bit to many UAVS for my taste.Also seen here is a shot
    of Tibet, who, after nearly 20 turns, have yet to use their Great Prophet. C’mon
    Songstan, get it together. This is why you’re getting all those wars declared!
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene38.jpg
  narration: Back in Hawaii (the islands, not the civ), the Australians are recovering
    from the attacks by the Inuit. It also seems like they have Open borders with
    the Blackfoot, making the likelihood of Crowfoot joining this war slim to none.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Inuit Northern front seems to have changed little , but the open
    borders with Vietnam shows that the Trung Sisters seem to be everybody’s friends
    but Sibir. The Blackfoot also have puppeted most of former Mexico, meaning his
    production of more units will be limited.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene40.jpg
  narration: Down in Central America, Parkes is kicked from his last holding as Ekeuhnick
    takes Uxmal. Dejected, Australia takes a few more shots at the Buccaneers before
    sailing to brighter seas.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene41.jpg
  narration: Down in Brazil, we see a carnivale of units, a strong carpet for Pedro
    that just needs someone to throw it at. But it seems Brazil is more interested
    in getting ready for the next UN meeting, where they will discuss a World’s Fair
    and National Heritage Sites.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene42.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile, Iceland has been busy unpuppeting the cities of England and
    Ireland, creating a good production base for Europe to go along with his walls
    of carriers. The friend ship with Sweden, as shown by Open borders, means that
    an intervention by Iceland on Finland’s behalf is unlikely.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene43.jpg
  narration: Speaking of Finland, Lappeenrenta falls to Sweden, and the advancing
    armies of Gustavus march towards Vantaa, ignoring Jyvaskyla for the time being.
    Also shown here are a mass of Finnish carriers, floating idly in Sibirean waters
    as their country burns. Their power is all but useless, as Sweden has sent no
    ships to the region, forcing engagements only on land.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene44.jpg
  narration: And force engagements they do! Minsk and Moscow are nearly theirs, and
    Vaasa is being besieged as well. Kekkonen seems to be pulling his men back, trying
    to find some ground to hold against the advancing army, but will he find it in
    time?
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene45.jpg
  narration: While the battle to the south hasn’t changed, direct your attention to
    Constantinople. Boer Units are in Icelandic borders, meaning that the two nations
    are probably on good terms. While this is good news for peace, it undoubtedly
    means that a Neo-Punic War between Iceland and the Boers is not in the cards for
    the time being.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene46.jpg
  narration: A Sri Lankan trading ship sails through Boer waters, passing through
    almost as many carriers as their are hovertanks as they travel to the only shown
    puppet city the Boers have in the south. With their massive production, the Boers
    can start cranking out more units soon enough, just as soon they stop starving
    their cities.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene47.jpg
  narration: Back on the Vietnam/Sibir front little has changed. Sibir continues to
    hold Nishapur and Bamda, and Vietnam desperately tries to retake it. These two
    cities, along with Ghanzi to the south, form a meatgrinder which slowly drains
    the two civs of resources, though it is unclear who will have the advantage in
    the end.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene48.jpg
  narration: Mongolia has a small problem, and that is that it’s woefully behind in
    tech. They barely have 70 techs, and with Korea for a neighbor, a war could mean
    the end for Genghis. His cities have laughable defense numbers, only one of the
    cities shown here has triple digits. While he has less forces, Sejong’s superior
    armed forces could rage through Mongolia in short order.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene49.jpg
  narration: But Genghis isn’t alone in this.Down in Kimdoneasia, we see that most
    of Jandamarra’s cities are unpuppeted and have low defenses when compared to Australia
    and Vietnam.  The Kimberely better hope that Trung Nhi and Trung Trac don’t decide
    to have Jandamarra become another Trung Sister.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene50.jpg
  narration: Next we go to a shot of the Australian eastern core, in all its glory.
    Most of the former Kimberely cities have been unpuppeted, and Parkes is armed
    to the teeth with units(though the couple Diggers seem out of place). While he
    may be losing his holdings in America, it will be much harder to force Parkes
    from his native space.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene51.jpg
  narration: Deep in the Pacific, a blackfoot cargo ship trades food and supplies
    from the mainland to a far flung colony off the Aleutian Islands. These cities
    have been relatively peaceful through the CBR, and will most likely be once of
    the hardest hit when the eventual war with the Inuit commences.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene52.jpg
  narration: The turn ends with Ekeuhnick’s forces right outside Torreon. Will the
    White Walkers be able to take Parkes’ last tenuous hold on America?
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene53.jpg
  narration: YES! Torreon falls to the Inuit, and Australia throws in the towel. The
    war is over, and while PArkes has gained some land from the White Walkers, it‘s
    not anywhere enough to make up for what was lost. In a rage, Parkes decides to
    join the growing coalition of Anti-Tibet, hoping to bring at least SOMEBODY down.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene54.jpg
  narration: The Inuit-Australia peace is also a boon for the Buccaneers, who are  now
    protected by borders of Brazil and Inuit from further Aussie attacks. A lone Icelandic
    Caravel looks on, wondering what the hell it is doing out here.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene55.jpg
  narration: A shot of the North Africa, where workers vastly outnumber the acutal
    fighting units. While many cities are puppeted, the few that aren’t seem to be
    churning out a great deal of units.  But war doesn’t seem to be on Ingolfur’s
    mind for the time, so Kruger is sending his legion of workers to clean up and
    set up before the carpet comes.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene56.jpg
  narration: Back on the Nordic war, Vantaa is on the verge of collapse, and previous
    Swedish gains seem to be well within their grasp. Meanwhile, Sibir clear the way
    for Finland’s fleets, but Kekkonen seems content to have his ships sit in the
    Arctic Circle for now.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene57.jpg
  narration: Further south, it seems Kekkonen has begun to put up a resistance. Minsk
    flipped back to his side, and Moscow has a few melee units nearby ready to take
    back the city. But Sweden has taken Vaasa, and doesn’t show signs of stopping
    his campaign any time soon.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part86-scene58.jpg
  narration: Nicaea, a city that has been ignored by Sweden for most of this campaign,
    now begins taking damage via bombing runs. From the coastline, Icelandic, Vietnamese,
    Boer, even a lone Armenian Paratrooper, watch, as Sweden tears through Finland
    like wet tissue paper.
- scene_number: "59"

  narration: Near the levant, Paul Kruger seems to be moving a large number of forces
    toward Anatolia. Who know what is going th- hang on a minute. I-Is that a caravel
    I spy? In the Mediterranean?! Cmon’ Ingolfur, I know you have the most capitals,
    but that’s no excuse for not doing your upgrading!

  narration: Ghanzi continues to remain green for the time being, though Kuchum Khan
    can and will probably have something to say about this. He is even sending a few
    quads to try and recapture Kabul. Meanwhile, Armenia continues to tempt fate as
    it re-arms itself, but the open borders between it two biggest threats seem to
    be good for Tiridates III.

  narration: Nishapur and Bamda continue to hold for Sibir though, and the Trung Sisters
    seem to be struggling in capturing the cities, let alone securing them. But with
    all the resources wasted, one must wonder when peace will be declared, if ever.

  narration: On the Indian subcontinent, we see a shot of Indietnam, along with a
    brief glimpse at Sri Lanka. With a mix of annexed and puppeted, these cities offer
    various degrees of importance, but thanks to Sri Lanka and Kimberley’s attitude,
    this seem to be fine for now.

  narration: A shot of Sibir’s core, with few units, and even fewer puppeted cities.
    Despite that, Kuchum Khan’s cities have better city defense than their Mongolian
    brethren to the north in their exclave.

  narration: The Blackfoot core meanwhile, has a large number of paratroopers, and
    a healthy smattering of tanks and artillery as well. If Crowfoot survives that
    long, those pararoopers will turn into XCOMs, meaning that Blackfoot can have
    even better snipes.

  narration: A shot of Iceland’s border with the Inuit show 2 fleets, and while the
    White Walkers have a smaller fleet, Iceland has a whole bunch of carriers mucking
    things up. But to their credit, Ingfolur has more production  muscle in Greenland
    than Ekeuhnick does on the former Canadian coast, so this could be anyone’s game,
    especially if Iceland upgrades all those paratroopers.

  narration: Back on the Swedes, we see that Vantaa has fallen, and Tampere seems
    to be the next to go. Astute viewers may also see we have an extra spy at our
    disposal, and that can only mean one thing...

  narration: Moscow has fallen to the Swedes! The Swedes celebrate both this victory,
    and the capture of Nicaea to the south. While the Finnish forces attempt to retake
    the city, Kekkonen retreats to Leningrad; his antlers broken, and glasses shattered,
    and smashed on Soviet vodka.

  narration: While Minsk and Nicaea have not fallen firmly into Swedish hands, its
    seems only a matter of time before they fall into Gustavus’s hands like so many
    other Finnish cities. As Finland’s neighbors continue to watch, it seems unlikely
    that they will help Kekkonen escape his grisly fate.

  narration: Moving westward, we see a shot of the Swedish core, where the cost is
    more heavily defended than the mainland. This is to be expected, considering that
    the armies march east into Finland, but Gustavus should think about unpuppeting
    some of those cities soon, as they can start churning out more units for war.

  narration: Speaking of cores, check out that Boer core. Kruger’s homeland seems
    to be decently covered in a mixture of infantries and hovertanks, and many of
    his major cities, including former Kongolese capital M’banza Kongo, have been
    unpuppeted or continue to produce units, eager to refill Kruger’s armies.

  narration: The north of Boer lands however, are sparsely filled, and filled with
    puppets. Although Iceland has a few cities like Rome and Cartaheg to pump out
    the units, the open borders with between the two civs, coupled with the fact that
    Ingolfur has no less than THREE CARAVELS sitting in the sea means that Paul Kruger
    probably has a bit more time to annex these cities

  narration: As we continue along the coast, we see a few Boer cities have been annexed
    but are still in chains (get working on those courthouses Kruger), while Ingolfur
    has annexed the former fields of France. While this could spell trouble, Kruger’s
    cities have high defenses thanks to the various Future Worlds wonders, meaning
    it will take more than Caravels to bring them under Iceland’s control.

  narration: Back in the mountains, Sibir and Vietnam still maintain their teneous
    grip on the cities from a few slides back, but Vietnam has taking to shelling
    a few of the inner cities.  One must wonder how long this war will continue to
    rage, as no decisive breakthrough has been made.

  narration: With the slow grindingness of the war, one must wonder why Vietnam or
    Sibir hasn‘t invaded the exclaves of Finland yet. These would open up new points
    in the conflict, and potentially cause a breakthrough. While this might backfire
    on Sibir, being close to the Finnish border, One must wonder why Vietnam continues
    to be peaceful with Kekkonen when there is so much to gain.

  narration: Moving to the Veitnam core, we see the Vietnamese carpet is primarily
    UAV Drones, though the sisters seem to have a good number of paratroopers as well.
    We also see that the new religion Buddhism doesn’t seem to be spreading quickly,
    but is still doing better than Tibet’s religion, which doesn’t exist at all.

  narration: The Kimberely send a trading ship to their former enemies Australia,
    where we get to see Sydney in all its glory. The Australians may have lost AMerica,
    but they aren’t budging from Oceania any time soon.

  narration: The island chain to the northeast of New Zealand confirms this, as numerous
    cities have over 200 defense, and are protected by the Grand Wobbegong Armada.
    Only time will tell though, if Australia decides to use its massive power for
    anything besides defense.

  narration: As the Inuit rebuild their new conquests, a Texan trading vessel is seen
    here, moving through Buccaneer lands to reach the the city of A’aninin on the
    other side of the country. Henry Morgan seems content to let Sam Houston survive
    for now, but one must wonder when Morgan will stop drinking his rum, and start
    pillaging again.

  narration: Taking a look at cities for a change, we see Tiridates II rebuilding
    his glorious army, this time adding paratroopers to supplement his tanks and carriers.
    Yerevan also seems to be missing the plague that attacked so many many capitals.

    more cargo ships to be built. His city is also close to making a Great Artist,
    who know what art it will make on the idyllic island.

  narration: Reykjavik meanwhile, is busy creating Railgun Armor, most likely to shore
    up his defenses.  With the Boers as a neighbor, Ingolfur is right to be building
    his army up. But perhaps it would be better to make these in the mainland Ingolfur?

  narration: Tampere falls to the yellow fever, and it seems that Kuopio is next to
    go. The once mighty Finnish empire is now just a line between the might of Sweden
    and Sibir. While Finland may not go away for good due to their exclaves, the end
    is drawing near for Urho Kekkonen.

  narration: Minsk and Nicaea have fallen into Sweden’s hands, and with no melee units
    in sights, it seems that this time they’re Gustavus’s for good. The Finnish forces
    should retreat to make their final stand soon, before the Finland is nothing more
    than exclaves.

  narration: Look at all those Vietnamese troops.I didn’t realize what Vietnam was
    doing at first with all these units here, but then it hit me. Vietnam is going
    THROUGH Finland to reach Sibir! It’s a ballsy move folks, but will it pay off?

  narration: As we look at the Arabian peninsula, we see that the majority of Vietnamese
    cities are undefended(with the exception of Vung Tau), while the Boers have many
    workers but few troops in the area. Do the Trung Sisters feel that safe, or do
    they just not want to send anyone into the desert?

  narration: One thing’s for certain, anything’s better than the mountain meatgrinder.
    Sibir forces are positioned in Tyumen, not allowing Vietnam to cross through the
    exclave into their homeland. Besides a little more bombing for the border towns,
    it’s business as usual here.

  narration: That’s not to say the Trung Sisters aren’t trying. Units seem to be marching
    from Xigaze and Hoa Lu towards the fight, which could see more intense fighting
    in the coming parts. Also of note is Tibet’s units spreading out into Vietnam,
    eagerly spreading out to make their own outdated carpet to rival Mongolia.

  narration: Up in the frozen coast of Asia, a couple of Finnish draft dodging paratroopers
    watch as White Walker workers work hard at improving the lands formerly held by
    Yakutia. While there aren’t many units and a whole lot of puppeted cities, Ekeuhnick
    might soon have this area covered in a blizzard of units.

  narration: Down in Indonesia, we see a large group of Australian units, defending
    the islands in case of an invasion by Vietnam. While such a thing is unlikely,
    Parkes’ turtling strategy might create troubles down the line for the Trung Sisters.

  narration: THAR SHE BLOWS, the poorly defended Buccaneer core! Morgan only has a
    handful of troops, scattered across the Caribbean, and much of his air force is
    stationed in Petit-Grove.  He’s going to have to put some real muscle into unit
    production, or else the Inuit may decide they want some rum.

  narration: At the bottom of the ladder though, we see that Finland is now hemorrhaging
    money, having lost most of their empire to Sweden. It’s getting to the point that
    Finland might not be able to pay his troops.

  narration: Turning to Land area, Australia continues to hold the record, whereas
    the Boers and Inuit are in a close race for second place. However, considering
    that InfoAddict counts the water tiles, looking at u/Pythor101’s recent post of
    Civs True Size, the Boers have the largest land area. Sweden has also added a
    large amount of land to their empire, allowing them to pass Korea in size.

  narration: Next we have military manpower, where we see the gap between Australia’s

    Worse still, a great deal of that manpower is either far from the battleground
