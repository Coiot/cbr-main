  narration: Hello everyone and welcome to Part 96 of everyone’s favorite bloodbath,
    the Civ Battle Royale! This is u/Bronnakus, a supporter of all things icy blue.
    Seen above here is the first post on the sub that’s made me audibly laugh in a
    while, u/thehonestyfish ‘s The Power Ranker’s Dilemma.

  narration: As always we start with our fantastic maps. Here is Melon’s map, which
    never ceases to amaze me with its detail.

  narration: And here is the Tile Accurate map. Good lord, look at that bordergore
    in the Old Vietnam Empire.

  narration: Here we’ve got the good ol’ Power Ranking slide. Boers, unsurprisingly,
    remain at number one.

  narration: And we kick things off with a nice view of North America, showcasing
    the incredibly-carpeted Blackfoot surrounded by the chilly blue. One would be
    tempted to think that it’d be even in a matchup just due to the Blackfoot carpet
    but look at the tech difference! Marines vs. Biotroopers. Hell, look at the city
    defenses. Marines and paratroopers won’t cut it, Crowfoot. In World Congress news
    we see Scholars in Residence passes. Should make tech catch-up easier for those
    who need it.

  narration: "“You can’t let Parkes one-up you like that! You need your own Pacific
    Garbage Patch!” says Big Carrier’s Korean sales rep to Sejong. The Ice Sheet Fleet
    is looking a little more smartly-built to the north, but the only melee ships
    I can see are Blackfoot."

  narration: The Boers continue to struggle to make it past the Indus River. They
    have a slight advantage at the moment, with more melee units near the border cities
    than Vietnam, but it looks like both sides are running out of steam at the moment.
    Also of note, it appears Susa has been reduced to a pile of radioactive mush.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene08.jpg
  narration: The Sibir assault is starting to crack through Swedish lines. Gothenburg,
    Moscow, and Antioch are all looking ready to fall in the upcoming turns. Swedes
    are putting up a hell of a resistance with what they have, though.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene09.jpg
  narration: Fueled with Stalin’s OwnTM Liquid Courage, brave Swedes storm Stalingrad
    and Jyvaskya, retaking them for the Blue and Yellow. Not easily defeated, Sibir
    has Stalingrad surrounded and ready to flip back, along with Kharkov to the south.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene10.jpg
  narration: The Icelanders retake Constantinople, seriously shrinking southern Sweden.
    Every city is in the black, however, so a Swedish snipe wouldn’t be too crazy.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene11.jpg
  narration: Faltering on four fronts, the Swedes lose Hamburg to the Icelanders.
    It’s not looking good for everyone’s favorite opportunists, but off in the distance,
    a Swedish general is elated to hear that they can attack in any direction they
    please.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene12.jpg
  narration: With an amphibious assault, Sweden is now back in control of both Jyvaskylas.
    Unfortunate for them, the Sibir are likely to flip back the one with the nicer
    weather and strategic value. Shucks.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene13.jpg
  narration: The hungover Swedes get forced back out of Stalingrad. It seems the Swedes
    have the slight upper hand in numbers at the moment, but the Sibir will win in
    the long run. Gustavus needs to get Khan to the negotiating table quick if he
    wants to survive.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene14.jpg
  narration: Kekkonen plots Armenian death and destruction from his palace in Tyumen,
    the capital of Exclavia. It’s pretty well-carpeted, but I guess that’s easy when
    you don’t own two of the tiles adjacent to your city. Regardless, a war to determine
    who’s less irrelevant would be fun to see.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene15.jpg
  narration: Panduranga, once the capital of the mighty Cham, has been reduced to
    2 population. It’s in Australian hands for now, and it seems the Kimberley Peacekeeping
    Force is finally working in the Aussies’ favor for once.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene16.jpg
  narration: A huge Sibir push in the south blasts a hole in the Swedish defense.
    Getting squeezed by the twin gray blobs on both sides may just push the Swedish
    all the way back to Scandinavia at this rate.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene17.jpg
  narration: A quick peep into Yerevan shows the Armenians are cranking out paratroopers.
    Could there be a long-range snipe plan in the works? Probably not, but one could
    hope.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene18.jpg
  narration: Tyumen, on the other hand, produces a recycling center. Hey, when you
    can’t hold land to save your life, making resources out of thin air makes sense.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene19.jpg
  narration: Ambon falls back to Vietnam, but they aren’t likely to hold it for long.
    Then again, neither will Australia hold Panduranga much longer by the looks of
    things.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene20.jpg
  narration: Lashkar Gar falls to the Boerg. Both sides seem to have brought a good
    chunk of reinforcements, so we’ll get a bloodier, more exciting stalemate until
    one lands another punch.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene21.jpg
  narration: The Swedes march south towards Iceland to try to maintain their Balkan
    holdings, but each wave is looking thinner and slower than the last.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene22.jpg
  narration: Ever a lover of collecting capitals, Ingolfur marches through the streets
    of Berlin. The Swedes have a good deal of land left, but the bell tolls for all
    leaders some day. At this rate, it may toll for Gustavus before it does for Kekkonen.
    It’d be some pretty sweet revenge for Exclavia to outlive Sweden.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene23.jpg
  narration: Panduranga is back in Vietnamese hands. This front is looking pretty
    rough for the Aussies, in no small part because of the thorn-in-the-side Kimberley.
    C’mon, Jandamarra. Let some carnage happen.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene24.jpg
  narration: A small Vietnamese naval force is sent to terrorize the Western Aussie
    coast, and the Strayans don’t seem to have more than a single naval unit to deal
    with them. For the world’s biggest military, that’s pretty surprising. It seems
    the Vietnamese brought nukes to a ship fight, too, judging by the pillaged mine.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene25.jpg
  narration: Rangoon, home of the best way to serve crab meat(don’t fight me on this,
    it’s true), seems to have been nuked itself. It’s in both Boer and Aussie range,
    so it’s a toss up as to who’s the culprit. In the east, it seems Saigon and Dong
    Hoi are on their last legs, and Hanoi is under threat too.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene26.jpg
  narration: Moscow appears to have flipped a couple times, down to 3 pop. The Swedes
    have done a hell of a job defending Kharkov, and have even retaken Stalingrad.
    Seems like Stalin’s OwnTM is some pretty addictive stuff.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene27.jpg
  narration: Though Lodz and Malmo are under heavy threat, it seems the Swedes are
    grinding Iceland to a halt, slowly but surely. Iceland is certainly winning this
    war at the moment, though.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene28.jpg
  narration: The Swedish flag is back over Constantinople, and a push on Ohrid seems
    to be next on the agenda. It’s really a see-saw in the European theater at the
    moment.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene29.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian overflow washes up on the shores of Inuit Central America.
    One has to wonder if these units are just really late for the short-lived Inuit-Brazil
    war a few parts back.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene30.jpg
  narration: In a tremendous effort, the Aussies take Vijaya and Panduranga. When
    Saigon and Dong Hoi fall, it’s going to be a two-pronged attack on Hanoi, already
    deep in the red. Things aren’t looking good for the Sisters, as mission control
    for their Space Station is based in Hanoi.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene31.jpg
  narration: Lashkar Gar is back in the hands of the Vietnamese. Of course, like all
    victories on this front, it is likely to be short-lived.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene32.jpg
  narration: VietNukes are aboard a carrier and heading for the Boers. If they make
    it to the core, they could do some real damage here. On the other hand, the Boer
    cybersubs probably won’t let the carrier get too close.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene33.jpg
  narration: Gothenburg is traded for Antioch, but holy hell the Sibir took Minsk!
    Things are looking worse for Gustavus, even if he’s likely to take it back.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene34.jpg
  narration: Kharkov and Stalingrad flip again as things grow more dire for the Swedes.
    There’s hardly a single front that I’d consider them winning on, and they have
    four fronts!
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene35.jpg
  narration: Constantinople goes gray again as the Swedes reclaim Ohrid. Constantinople
    will likely flip back yellow soon, but this pancake war(Get it? ‘Cause it’s flip-floppety!)
    is really draining Swedish resources desperately needed elsewhere.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene36.jpg
  narration: Malmo falls to the Icelanders as Sweden looks increasingly likely to
    lose damn near everything aside from Scandinavia.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene37.jpg
  narration: One of the Gray forces lob a nuke all the way up to Linkoping, a city
    that one would think would be safe from this war. No rest for the weary, I suppose.
    Also, it is incredibly sad that the only Swedish naval melee unit I can see is
    a privateer. It’s 3026, Sweden. Get it together.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene38.jpg
  narration: Big Carrier continues their death grip on Iceland’s navy. The Great Atlantic
    Garbage Patch is really shaping up to be greater and garbagier than its Pacific
    counterpart.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian overflow reaches all the way north. I think the scarier
    thing for the Inuit is the lack of their own carpet, though. I mean, I know they
    have a ton of land, but you have to carpet, Ekeuhnick.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene40.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian Antarctic colonies are looking pretty nice right about
    now. Well-defended, out of the way, peaceful, and prosperous. Might be one of
    the nicest places to live on the cylinder, if you like snowball fights and high
    population density.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene41.jpg
  narration: If Parkes ever loses everything but one area, he’s going to be keeping
    his Antarctic holdings. These things are natural fortresses. Also, World Congress
    is looking to ban truffles and reject natural heritage sites like every other
    session.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene42.jpg
  narration: Recruit I’mNotEvenGonnaTry uncovered a plot from the Mongols to take
    down the SnoreYaks once and for all. All I’m going to say, Genghis, is do it.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene43.jpg
  narration: Saigon appears to have flipped back and forth a time or two, but that
    seems to be the only Aussie progress since we last visited them. Vijaya and Panduranga
    are back in Vietnamese hands for the moment, but don’t count on them staying that
    way too long.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene44.jpg
  narration: The Boers push the Boerder past the Indus and take Lashkar Gar and Kandahar.
    Vietnam really can’t do well on two fronts at once. They just pushed the Strayans
    out of Southeast Asia, and now this. Gee whiz.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene45.jpg
  narration: The Swedes continue to get railroaded by the Sibir, but things are looking
    up. In the bottom of the screen, you can see they’ve made peace with the Icelanders.
    Is it too little too late?
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene46.jpg
  narration: Holy hell look at that bordergore. Iceland gets to keep the prized Constantinople,
    as well as most of the Balkans, but at least the Swedes get Ohrid.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene47.jpg
  narration: |-
    The Swedes lost a good chunk of land here. Malmo, Berlin, Hamburg, and a ton of damage to their heartland cities.
    Coiot‘s Note: The capital snipers never disappoint. Tasty Berlin and a secured Constantinople baby—tally for the top is tied at 11.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene48.jpg
  narration: I can’t tell if this was a stupid peace deal offering or an actual invasion,
    but giving Iceland a beachhead for next war on the Scandinavian peninsula can’t
    be a good thing.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene49.jpg
  narration: Let’s take a trip to Jokuskai. Producing nothing right now with its 356
    hammers, but gold and science are flowing like water. Korea’s doing pretty well
    for itself.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene50.jpg
  narration: 'On the Mongol side, we have Sanchu. Starving, also producing nothing
    with its 43 hammers, and doesn’t even have half the building Jokuskai has. On
    a tangentially-related note: SEJONG. DECLARE. A. WAR.'
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene51.jpg
  narration: Everyone’s favorite one-tile island Kaneohe is up next. Producing mobile
    SAMs, perhaps preparing for the day someone comes back to wipe Hawaii off the
    map already. Most people want to see Yakutia killed already(and I am among them),
    but I really want to see the original peacekeepers get wiped out. They can’t keep
    clinging to life. Parkes pls.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene52.jpg
  narration: Not wanting to let the Trungs be the only ones in space, Ingolfur orders
    a space station to be built in Waterford. To the left(and the right, and the top
    and bottom) you can see an incredible amount of carriers floating around doing
    absolutely nothing.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene53.jpg
  narration: Off in the peaceful lands of the professional peacekeepers, Djarindjin
    is producing a stock exchange. Compared to the cities we’ve been seeing, the city
    looks pretty underdeveloped, but it IS in Antarctica.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene54.jpg
  narration: The pendulum swings back towards the Aussies and they take Ambon, Panduranga,
    and Thi Li Bi Nai. With every flip of Panduranga, it looks increasingly more likely
    that Australia will hold it. The sisters are running out of units and cities to
    produce them in.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene55.jpg
  narration: Never one to lose on both fronts at once, Vietnam scrounges up a hell
    of an army and sends them west to reconquer the Indus River Valley from the Boer.
    This time, however, they’re meeting some stiff resistance. But, in purely numbers,
    Vietnam seems to have the slight upper hand at the moment.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene56.jpg
  narration: Sweden is getting pushed back heavily on this front. Hopes of holding
    both Jyvaskylas are fading fast. Moscow is loosely gray, but likely to stay gray
    when all is said and done.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene57.jpg
  narration: 'Even more Brazilian overflow, this time in Iceland. Brazil, do some
    good with these units. Attack the Boers while they’re busy with the Trungs. Start
    the OCP part 2: Electric Boogaloo. Also, look how massive Porto is. 45 pop. Someone
    check to see if it’s the biggest city on the cylinder.'
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene58.jpg
  narration: In the ever-more-green-and-not-just-because-the-radiation Sahara, we
    see a pretty sparse showing of Boer units that aren’t turn-time-murdering workers.
    Brazil would do fairly well in a war here. At least, during the beginning. But
    doing damage to the heart of the Boers would be fantastic for everyone who doesn’t
    want to see the orange menace prosper and steamroll like they’ve been doing(me).
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene59.jpg
  narration: In the more peaceful (but still getting bombed) part of the Australian
    Isles, we see fewer units than one would expect. Are the Aussies running out of
    units to throw at the Vietnamese?
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene60.jpg
  narration: Korea looks pretty well-carpeted at first, but it’s really just their
    navy. The Mongols probably have the most land units in the slide, but I’m certainly
    not counting them up.
- scene_number: "61"
  scene_title: 61
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene61.jpg
  narration: Kandahar goes back to green, Lashkar Gar is next, the see-saw teeters
    back to Vietnam.
- scene_number: "62"
  scene_title: 62
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene62.jpg
  narration: Kuopio falls, Linkoping and Jyvaskyla are under heavy threat, and Sweden
    is getting backed up heavily. The poor ethnic Finns in these cities can’t catch
    a break.
- scene_number: "63"
  scene_title: 63
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene63.jpg
  narration: The Isles are looking pretty sparse these days. It’s pretty clear Ingolfur
    threw everything he had at the Swedes. Brazil and Aussie overflow make it this
    far north. The Strayans better get those guys back to Vietnam, their conquests
    sit largely undefended.
- scene_number: "64"
  scene_title: 64
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene64.jpg
  narration: Antioch flips back to the Swedes, but their victory is going to be short-lived.
    A massive Sibir reinforcement is on the way. The Swedes better get some kind of
    peace deal soon, or they could be turned into another Mongolia.
- scene_number: "65"
  scene_title: 65
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene65.jpg
  narration: The Boers continue the stalemate at the Indus. With a steady trickle
    of units coming from both sides, neither will have the upper hand to move the
    front either deeper into India or back to the mountains without some kind of overwhelming
    surge.
- scene_number: "66"
  scene_title: 66
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene66.jpg
  narration: Dong Hoi is pretty solidly Aussie. The Vietnamese keep throwing everything
    they’ve got at defending Saigon, since holding it means holding Hanoi. Mounted
    on a spider tank are two nuclear missiles. Australia is trying to go in for the
    kill. Damn Australian spiders. Now they’re even radioactive.
- scene_number: "67"
  scene_title: 67
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part96-scene67.jpg
  narration: A lone Australian cybersub stares down the huge Vietnamese armada descending
    upon the Old Kimberley Coast. Windjana has been nuked, yet again, unless Australia’s
    workers are really that slow. The only good thing for the Aussies on this slide
    is that Vietnam forgot to pack a melee unit.

  narration: Over in Eastern Australia one can see a bunch of naval units sitting
    around doing absolutely nothing to protect the about-to-be-hammered West Coast.

  narration: The Korean-Inuit border is looking pretty thin on both sides. Ekeuhnick

    some more Asian clay.

  narration: As the Lone Star Battleship drifts along in the Pacific ocean, Sam Houston
    looks up from his bottle of Southern Comfort. His advisors tell him that Kuchum
    Khan wishes him dead. Sam gets up from his chair, staggers to his desk, and sloppily
    loads up his six-shooter. “Let ‘em come try.” he slurs, only to pass out shortly
    after.

  narration: Looking at Ciudad Juarez now, we see the Blackfoot are producing power

  narration: Not content with this reality, the Boerg construct another simulation
    server. They render a spherical Earth, one where two hundred civilizations fight
    for domination. Well folks, no Infoaddict slides this week, so that just about
