      "The Official /r/Civ 60+ Civ Battle Royale! | Part 1: In the Beginning....\nHey
      there guys! My name is TPangolin, and it‘s an absolute honour have all of you
      on board to witness a battle of absolutely crazy proportions. What lies ahead
      is a battle that will last for millenia - over 60 Civilizations, both Firaxis
      and Fan-Made will battle it out on the largest Earth Map available. Some areas
      like Europe will be a hotspot of contention, where civs will have to brutally
      fight against each other in order to gain that vital early-game upper hand. Other
      areas on the globe are much more open, but are we sure these civs will make the
      most of what they‘re given? Join us on a journey bathed in blood, where one nation
      will hopefully become victorious over 60 of their lesser global neighbours.\nJoin
      us as we step into the madness that is the Official /r/civ 60+ A.I Battle Royale!\nJoining
      me for annotations today are the people behind the official Power Rankings. Independent
      fans that rate Civilizations based on their potential! We‘ll see how accurate
      their predictions turn out to be. Also, join us over on /r/civbattleroyale for
      artwork, civilized discussion and not so civilized trash-talking! \nLet‘s begin!"

      First up, we have a map showing off all the starting locations of the
      61 Civilizations involved in this Battle Royale. Now since this map projection
      is Equirectangular, certain ares on the globe may seem skewed - but it‘s a good
      enough reference to see the potential that some civs have (and conversely, which
      ones seem the most likely to falter).

      weary Babylonian Submarine plays home to an already impatient Nebucadnezzar. From
      this bastion of frost and subsequent misery, the brave Babylonian crew members
      will, for generations keep a close eye on global happenings.

      Let‘s first take a look at the Civilizations of the North Sea. Throughout this initial inception of the Battle Royale I‘ll be posting the Power Rankings of certain civs alongside annotations. Firstly, let‘s have a look at the potential of the Irish!
      Some consider Malacy II to be an underdog, but its UU is perfectly designed for a Battle Royale such as this. Cheaper, faster and more resistant to ranged fire than regular long swordsman, look for these special units to spam the field and overwhelm any opposition. Also taking into account that they will receive a starting bonus to keep them competitive in the very early game, I for one, can see Ireland making a surprise late run in this brutal and unforgiving world. Sadly, being relegated to a small island in an already crowded location, the hive mind agrees that Ireland will most likely be a small bit player throughout the series, if they even survive.

      "A quick glance at our Western Mediterranean contenders! Let‘s focus
      first on the Portuguese and the Moroccans and their chances in this game. \nComing
      in at the 53rd spot we have Portugal, a civ that we feel could make some interesting
      moves in the beginning but will probably not be a serious contender in the long
      run. With a decent amount of open space to the North, and Morocco, our last place
      civ, to the South, Portugal does have room to expand. However, Portugal is destined
      to run into the European brick wall that is sure to be France, Germany, Poland,
      and Rome. Add to this the fact that Portugal‘s uniques are either City State or
      trade-based and we have a Civ that does not look to make for a serious contender.\nRanking:
      53/61\nMorocco is stuck between a rock of Gibraltar and a hot place. With the
      vast endless ocean on one side, and strong civs like Carthage, Portugal and all
      of Europe crowding them out on the other side, expect to see them hammered early
      and often. North Africa seems to be the go to place for European civs that run
      out of room as well, so invasions and many wars are a constant reality for this
      culture focused civ. With little to keep it alive, only dumb luck will see this
      civ last beyond the early game\nRanking: 61/61"

      To the west, we have five more Civilizations that may clash over this side of the Mediterranean. Let‘s shine a spotlight on the chances of Sparta and Israel!
      Sure to be a fan favorite, this.. is.. SPARTA! Alright, now that we have that out of our system let‘s look seriously at Sparta. First, it should be noted that Sparta‘s unique are currently under construction so these will not be looked at in this synopsis. However, it‘s widely agreed upon that Sparta is sure to be an early game combat-oriented civ. With this assumption in mind, we see Sparta as having a decent amount of potential in this Battle Royale. This potential will only come to fruition though if Leonidas pushes out and conquers a number of civs in the early game, where he will be strongest. The big mystery is, will he be mad enough to do so? Or will he let the Persians and other civs stomp around his lands? Nobody, including even our expert rankers, has any idea.
      Ranking: 40/61
      The spy master fan favorites from the previous game return, ready to peer through windows and hide inside of bushes with as much vigor as ever before. Their rank may appear low, but they lead the region with plenty of room to expand north and east. Historically sleepy neighbors like the Ayyyyyyubids and Arabs certainly help their odds as they will seek to, as before, quickly establish supremacy over the Levant and more. Their UAs, and even their UUs, will help propel the chosen peoples to be a religious super power at the very least, influencing their neighbors whose residents will soon yearn for the comforts of the kibbutz and gefilte fish.

      "To the north lies one of the fan favorite of the last game - Poland.
      Let‘s see what our panel thinks of Casimir‘s chances and his notoriously racist
      neighbour - Hitler. \nAs much as we would like to put simply POLAND STRONK here
      we feel it‘s better to explain why we put this fan favorite up top in the ever-crowded
      European area. Number 1. Have you played as Poland? Granted this is the AI and
      things do no always go according to plan (see: Tpang twitch: AI test) but it is
      undeniable that somebody at Firaxis really likes Poland, a free social policy
      for every era without the cost increasing? Yes please. Number 2. Their UB is pretty
      gnarly if ANY pasturable (that’s a word) animal source is nearby, no MC, and extra
      gold to top it all off an improvement on an already pretty good building. And
      finally number 3. Keeping it short and simple are the OP as Winged Hussars of
      destruction the only downside is that Poland has to hold out for that long surrounded
      by the USSR and Sparta and Germany etc. In conclusion POLAND STRONK!\nRanking:
      12/61\nACHTUNG! These liberal swine so-called “experts” deem the Third Reich in
      the LOWER HALF!?! Outrageous! Ja, we got our asses handed to us in BRv1, but in
      the test run we got our revenge against “stronk” Poland, Sudetenland and all!
      With major bonuses in wartime post-plastics (a free infantry unit for every city
      captured) and a decidedly stronger Great General and Panzer unit, all we have
      to do is keep their capital until the industrial age and we will have a better
      chance than most, even despite the high civ-density of Europe. You may be jumping
      on the Poland bandwagon early, but you know what they say... 'don‘t be stupid,
      be a smartie! Come and join the Nazi Party!'\nRanking: 37/61"

    narration: |-
      In the last game, Afghanistan and Armenia had plenty of room to settle West and East respectively, but now two new contenders have arrived to complicate the region‘s political standing - Persia and the Timurids.
      Afghanistan captured our hearts, and some Hunnic cities, last BR with their heroic and nearly-unbelievable defense of their homeland against Hun and Mongolian invasions. These unconquerable people were playing the scrappy-mountainous-defender game before it was cool (Tibet). Hipsterghanistan will look to build upon that legacy and improve from there with its combat bonus when near mountains and its excellent UU which replaces the Gatling gun but has five movement points. The addition of the Timurids and Persia, however, will force them to prove their worth sooner rather than later, this time around.
      Ranking: 26/61
      Persia is in one of the most hotly contested spots in the entire BR. They start right in the middle of IRL Iran. In the last BR, Israel was able to gain control of most of Iran just because the nearby Afghanistan, Armenia, and Arabia basically turtled the entire time. But now, with Persia in the picture, they now look to dominate the Middle East and keep their people happy so they use their UA to keep generating long Golden Ages with extra boosts. However, that is way easier said than done. Because they don‘t only have to worry about the Middle Eastern civs, including Byzantium, Israel, and the maybe-if-they-come-out-of-their-shell Arabian Empire. They also have to worry about Armenia and Afghanistan as well just in case they come out of their shells. And with more competition in India now, the Mughals might look west as well. Top it all off with the newcomer Timurids to the North and Persia has a lot to worry about. Chances are that at least one of those empires will eventually go into a full on war with Persia and cripple them. Persia has potential but there are is too hotly contested for us to rank them any higher.

      "To the north, the Huns and the Siberians lie in wait - eager for the
      inevitable upcoming battle. Can either of these civs hold it out for world domination?
      \nThe Hunnic Empire, and the 'Scourge of God' Atilla, are certain to liven things
      up in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Completely geared for a Domination victory,
      the Huns are a fierce opponent for any civ to take on. Expect their 1-2 UU punch
      of Horse Archers and Battering Rams to have devastating effects on their neighbors.
      The potential for this civilization to win is very real, now they just have to
      make the right moves.\nRanking: 17/61\nThe new coming Sibir Khanate, a near cousin
      to Mongolia, have not earned much love from our rankers, landing just south of
      the halfway mark and last in the ever-expansive steppe region of Asia. Squeezed
      in between a host of hyper-aggressive civs, their situation is indeed daunting.
      However the civ does have the capacity to storm its foes very quickly and perhaps
      establish itself in the region. Their UU allows them to move all units after attacking,
      and their UA, a ranged Calvary unit, can strike quickly to thin out the ranks
      of attackers or defenders. If this civ builds a large army than, coupled with
      its unique speed, they could prove deadly\nRanking: 34/61"

    narration:
      "Tibetan and Burmese challengers appear in the east! It seems almost
      certain that these civs are likely to mess with the Mughal and Vietnamese veterans
      of the Battle Royale. \nThe Mughals are supposed to be a culturally based civ
      with a UA that provides extra culture and production during Golden Ages. Well
      in the last BR they actually ended up being very aggressive and they almost took
      over the entire Indian Subcontinent by the end of it and reduced Gandhi‘s India
      to just IRL Bengal, Bangladesh, and Burma. The Mughals look to be aggressive again
      in this new BR but this time they have a lot more competition. First off they
      now have Sri Lanka to the South that they will have to compete with. Also Burma
      now lies to the East instead of Gandhi and Burma is a great defensive civilization.
      If the Mughals want to try the same shit from the last BR against Burma, then
      Sri Lanka can easily pick apart their empire from the South while Burma holds
      off the Mughal offensive. The Mughals will have to play smart if they want a shot
      at winning. If they don‘t, then if you listen closely, you‘ll be able to hear
      Akbar yelling, 'It‘s a Trap!' when his armies die and his cities burn.\nRanking:
      16/61\nTibet‘s location high in the rugged Himalayas may appear dismal, but no
      civ is better suited to the task. Landing just above the halfway marker, Tibet
      is helped by their unique ability which provides a food and faith boost from mountain
      tiles, a trait that is increased if their cities follow a religion started in
      the mountain kingdom. Their unique unit moves better in the mountains and comes
      in mid-game. This civ will prove the world‘s most implacable turtle, at the least,
      and if they expand north quickly, perhaps much more.\nRanking: 29/61"

      outskirts of the Indian Ocean. With Sri Pada adjacent to their capital, let‘s
      see their potential potential: \nBy the skin of its teeth, TPang gave the last
      minute surprise announcement that Sri Lanka was the 61st civ (and final civ) to
      be added to the game. Being given access to the lands of South Asia, they have
      a very high quality start once they can embark settlers. Earlier wars won’t be
      a problem as their long swordsman replacement heals up to three times as fast.
      Also, look out for them being a major religious powerhouse with many faith bonuses
      due to their UA and UB shrine replacement. However, it is equally likely becoming
      a religious powerhouse would make them a target as well, and they are certainly
      susceptible to a naval attack. It is still unknown if M.I.A. will be leading them,
      but it’s likely “Paper Planes” will be stuck in your head whenever TPang screen

      "To the north lies our three Asian tigers - China, Korea and Japan respectively.
      All three civs this have found their alternate leaders - so it‘s anyone‘s guess
      to see how they‘ll fare this time around. \nWell, Tojo’s Japan wasn’t exactly
      a “fan favorite” what with its game-crashing bugs requiring Godzilla’s presence
      (and eventually an overhaul) in the BRv1. Indeed, the middling Japan seems boxed
      in: they are one of nine (nine!) Oceania civs, the same number of civs as Africa;
      not to mention Yakutia to the north and more incentives for the Inuit to settle
      Westward. Meiji warfare depends entirely on how many golden ages they can stretch
      out: so starting slow, turtling, and wonder building (i.e., rushing Taj Majal,
      Chichen Itza) would likely do them a whole lot of good, and their culture bonuses
      seem to do well to help out with that sort of start. Their unique Great General
      helps out with that as well, causing a free golden age should they choose to expend
      it. They can then emerge from their turtle-shell after having researched replicable
      parts, when they could mass-produce their strong ironclad UU for an extremely
      powerful navy to wreak havoc on the seas.\nRanking: 35/61\nAh Korea, the science
      civ. Were this not a domination match, their position would be very strong. But
      Sejong is going to need to break out of the Korean peninsula, and he is surrounded
      by strong enemies. His two UU‘s are very strong on the defensive, but he may struggle
      to apply that strength to attack. His UA is excellent for a human, but in previous
      AI game the AI has struggled to make it work. Sejong‘s best bet is to expand north,
      and build spearmen to try and beat the horse lords of the steppes.\nRanking: 38/61"

      not enjoy the wide open spaces of the steppes he had last time, due to many rival
      hordes, but still has a decent amount of land to call his own. While his UA is
      completely useless, focusing on city states, both UU‘s will be important. Quickly
      suppressing those around him will be key to a Mongolian victory if he is not to
      be caught between the Red Giants of Stalin and Mao.\nRanking: 9/61"

      Royale - but what are their odds of survival? \nChampa is probably the least famous
      civ in the Battle Royale, which may be a factor in their low ranking. And certainly
      this civ hasn‘t been done any favors by its placement: stuck in the jungles of
      SE Asia, boxed in on all fronts by Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, and Burma
      (clockwise). What makes them an intriguing underdog is their UA, which makes waging
      war much more profitable, and has no era limit. If this civ can get out of the
      hole dug by its geography, this could be a surprisingly fun civ breathing life
      into what was dominated by Vietnam in Mk I.\nRanking: 58/61\nRizal‘s Philippines
      are going to have a difficult ride. An island civ, in a neighborhood that Indonesia
      will be able to quickly exploit, with no military bonuses. However he will have
      growth advantages, a necessity in the tiny islands of the East Indies, and his
      unique replacement for the rifleman has a powerful bonus after choosing an ideology.
      If he can survive until the modern era, the Philippines will become a force to
      be reckoned with. It‘s worth noting that they will start with the ability to embark,
      boosting the early game for the Filipino adventurers.\nRanking: 30/61"

      To the east we have the ultimate friendly rivalry; The Maori and Australia. With added sea bridges in Australia, will this initial comradarie end in bloodshed?
      Colonize Australia, colonize Australia, kiwi-nize Australia. This is all that Maori‘s leader, Te Rauparaha, should be focused on. Should the Maori let Australia become the monstrosity it was during the last Battle Royale though, we should see the Maori end up only as the turtling neighbor of the bigger, badder Australia. The Maori also have the option of setting sail to the East and attempting to get a foot in the door in the Americas. Seeing as all of their unique are combat-oriented, either option is completely within reason.
      Ranking: 24/61
      One of the winners of the last Battle, thanks in most part to a good location. As a civilization, Australia is almost entirely based around tourism, something of little importance this round. In previous AI games, Parkes has shown a penchant for turtling, with various levels of success. In the Battle Royale, he showed the true power of the turtle, by building up an immense military before striking against Indonesia. In the Colonialist Legacies game, he tried to turtle but never reached critical mass and was swiftly destroyed. But with Kimberley a stone‘s throw away, he can‘t afford to throw any shrimp on the barbie just yet. And he surely cannot hope for the easy success demonstrated last time. We shall all be waiting with bated breath for the return of the Tpangenning.

      Hawaii‘s start will be unlike any other civ in the BR. Beginning with virtually
      no neighbors, on a patchwork of islands out in the middle of the Pacific, Kamehameha
      is going to need to do 1 of 2 things if he wants even a chance at winning this

      2.) Build one of, if not the greatest, naval forces in the game. Should Kamehameha

      of Canada. If the Blackfoot head north, a mortal struggle with Eheuknik awaits

      from invasion by some of the most daunting landscapes on the map and still receiving

      Walker‘s favorable ranking comes from the relative lack of new competition for
      them. The Blackfoot have been added to the south, yes, but the high Yukon Mountains
      protect the Inuit prospects for expansion and defense and the civ still looks
      likely to grab some of eastern Siberia before the new Yakuts gobble it all up.

      being thrown into the mix, what are the chances of the Manifest Destiny (or subsequently
      Canifest Destiny) happening this time around? \nCanada, throughout Civ AI battles,
      has been in something of a conundrum. It appears to show both equal parts overwhelming
      success against its enemies, (Fan Favorites AI match, mini BR, CL AI battle, Battle
      Royale Mk1), holding out or winning wars where the enemy have advantages both
      large and small, yet in the same breath seems utterly incompetent (CL AI battle,
      Battle Royale Mk1). Their UA will give them massive diplomatic leverage, which
      will prove to be quite helpful, and their UGP will only add to this. As for their

      "Hitler follows by Polish example and settles the city of Hamburg on
      the coast. To the north lies our two Scandinavian gladiators - Norway and Sweden.
      Will Sweden become just another civ to be squashed, or will he take advantage
      of JFD‘s new Unique Ability to conquer his neighbours? Personally, I can‘t wait
      to find out. \nNorway, our highest ranking Scandinavian civ, comes in at #46.
      Unlike Sweden and Finland, who will face competition on all sides, Norway has
      the benefit of having only one battlefront to focus on, Sweden to the East. With
      Sweden sure to be rocked by the civs around it, Norway looks poised to take Sweden
      early on. Should however Norway fail to secure this eastern portion of Scandinavia,
      we‘re afraid we will see a Norway similar to the one in the previous BR. One that
      turtles early on and eventually falls to mightier, more expansive empires.\nRanking:
      46/61\nSecond to last, Sweden has been given no love from our rankers. Starting
      squished between Norway, Finland, Germany, and Poland though, this ranking is
      not without merit. Sweden is really going to have to have an expansionist mindset
      and more than a bit of luck if it wants a shot at winning this thing. It does
      not help that arguably their strongest unique, Nobel Prize, is completely based
      on City States and Friendships... Godspeed Gustavus Adolphus, Godspeed.\nRanking:

      "Caesar expands southward, fostering the potential meeting of Hannibal
      at Antium‘s city gates. With new contenders in the region, how will our Punic
      War/Battle Royale veterans fare this time around. \nHannibal is going to have
      to work hard to stay in the game. Before, in MKI, they had more room to expand.
      But now they have three more civs that are boxing them in: Morocco, Sparta, and
      Ashanti. They’re still a military based civ, but since they’re being surrounded
      by so many civs, it’ll be even harder for Carthage to conquer its neighbors without
      being attacked from behind. They still have potential to be a powerhouse in North
      Africa, but to get there would be like crossing the Alps: it’s gonna be fucking
      hard.\nRanking: 42/61\nCaesar’s got some problems on his hands. Rome starts off
      situated in the middle of the Italian peninsula, surrounded on all sides by water
      and mountains to the north. Although these mountains give Rome a defensive advantage
      against Germany and Poland, it leaves the land-focused civ little land to settle.
      Caesar will have to quickly settle south of France and in Iberia in order to have
      any land advantage over his neighbors. With Germany to the north, France to the
      west, Sparta to the east, and Carthage to the south, Rome is completely surrounded
      by warmongering civs. Fortunately Rome has strong Legions and Ballistas to help
      them expand and conquer in the Classical era. Caesar should easily be able to
      dominate his more late-game-focused neighbors like France and Germany early on.
      However, if he fails to exploit his early game advantages, Caesar might become
      irrelevant later on.\nRanking: 31/61"

      the right motivations, we could potentially see a Kongo Civilization that stretches
      from coast to coast to coast. \nKongo’s got more enemies this time. They now have
      the Ashanti to worry about up north. However, that only takes away a small portion
      of the land they have to settle. Their position in the Congo, which their UA adapts
      them to, also gives them a defensive position against encroaching armies. Their
      UB will also help them become an economic powerhouse in Africa. However, with
      the Boers to the south and a longer conga line of enemies to worry about, it’s
      still a mystery how well Nzinga will do.\nRanking: 32/61"

Gajah will have to rely on the sea to keep his beautful rotund figure.
      God damnit Gajah Mada. Arguably the worst Vanilla civ in the game is at least given some leeway in BR Mk II. Close to extinction before the collapse of the first game, Indonesia may have better odds with an Australia now preoccupied with the Kimberley, buying it crucial time to expand throughout, well, Indonesia. Still, a weak UU and dismal history of performance leave this island civ very low on our rankings and rightfully so, to climb higher they‘ll have some proving to do.

      Alexios Komnenos will get a Golden Age every time a war starts. Given his position on the edge of the Great European Clusterfuck, he may be in a Golden Age for as long as he lives. His naval UU, a replacement for the Galleass, which heals 15 points per turn in a Golden Age is going to be healing quite a lot, I suspect. Sparta, likely to be a warmonger, on his western front, may induce him to expand east into Anatolia, and away from the bloodbath that shall emerge.
