  narration: Welcome to Part 98 of the Civ Battle Royale! I am /u/AkraticCritic, Inuit
    supporter, and we kick things off with /u/SilverPhalanx’s fitting depiction of
    the Boers’ newly acquired Statue of “Liberty” in the rubble of Agra.

  narration: "/u/edse1991 puts the casualties of the Boer-Vietnam war in perspective
    with this map from all the way back in Part 19, showing all the ancient cities
    that have been nuked off the map during the conflict."

  narration: As always we have our wonderful Tile Accurate Map. Sweden will really
    be feeling the squeeze from their two recent wars - there’s not very many tiles
    separating Iceland and Sibir now.

  narration: The Boers continue to sit atop the PR leaderboard, but the surge of Brazilian
    ‘tourism’ to Africa is beginning to shake the rankers’ once rock solid confidence
    in the Ryk.

  narration: We open with a shot of ever-glorious Armenia, prophesied by Blue Cassette
    themselves to one day defeat the evil Boer Ryk and free the internet from Skynet’s
    grip. Until they get around to that however they’ve settled for slightly inconveniencing
    the Boer reinforcements trying to reach the Vietnamese front, and recreating the
    Manhattan Project from a stolen Boer child’s science kit.
- scene_number: "6"

  narration: Not too eager to let the Ryk keep the Statue of Liberty and its multiple-thousand
    hammer boost, the Trung Sisters send units to assault Agra from the north. They
    might manage to flip the city a few times, but Kruger’s steady flow of reinforcements
    should claim victory in the long run.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: 7
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene07.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Thi Li Bi Nai flips back to Vietnam, and Panduranga looks to follow next
    turn. Australia no longer has the numbers to make any serious pushes on this front,
    but the Peacekeeper Patrol and Vietnam’s lack of a local navy should stop the
    momentum from turning against Parkes.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene08.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Parkes’ biggest problem here is the awful composition of his land army.
    For a start its a bit SAMey, and he should talk to his opposition about what an
    over-reliance on drones does to you. He’d do well to peace out now and focus on
    building up this valuable beachhead for the next war.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene09.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Big Carrier’s grip extends even to Hawaii, composing over half of their
    navy. Their Australian counterparts apparently doesn’t have anywhere more useful
    to be right now, and in the corner the we see the White Walkers are scheming against
    Kamehameha. C’mon Ekeuhnick, you’ve got plenty of relevant civs you could choose
    from, don’t waste your time with a city state.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene10.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The former last bastion of freedom, Lhasa, is currently working on an
    engineering module - presumably to ensure the Trungs don’t lack for production
    if they need to evacuate to the ISS.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene11.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Brazilian citizens of Campinas starve as the government hoards supplies
    to feed their expanding legions of paratroopers. Pedro also seems to have decided
    that you don’t need a navy if you build enough hovertanks.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene12.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: A Boer biotrooper captures Trincomalee, but Vietnam should take it back
    shortly. Sri Lanka has open Boerders, but interestingly don’t seem to have the
    same relationship with the Trungs. Could Sri Lankan relevance finally be found,
    and the power rankers’ wormhole stopped? (No)
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene13.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Cham coast is reclaimed by the Trungs, and Hoi An has been abandoned
    by its conquerors. The population of Hanoi breathes a sigh of relief. Unless the
    Kimberly decide to join Australia, the capital shouldn’t fall in the near future.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene14.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Tianjin has flipped, but the Vietnamese reinforcements out of Phong Chau
    will likely flip it back. Sejong could make some gains by attacking now - small
    as his land army is, it’s enough to overwhelm the Australians.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene15.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Ice Sheet Fleet may have mostly avoided Big Carrier’s corruption
    but their Korean branch is doing their best to send Ekeuhnick some free samples.
    The difference in naval unit bias between the Inuit and Blackfoot is obvious,
    with the latter having almost exclusively melee units and the former lacking any
    on this slide.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene16.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Crowfoot might have a large carpet, but it’s largely outdated and won’t
    stand up to the Inuit biotroopers and robot infantry when the glacier inevitably
    shallows their land. Their impressive air force might let them flip a few cities
    though - every Blackfoot city in this slide has a 10-stack while the White Walkers’
    have 0. Fun fact - The Inuit  have as many settlers as cities on this slide.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene17.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Mongolia is in basically the same spot as the Blackfoot - an outdated
    carpet waiting for someone more powerful to bother attacking them. Sibir does
    seem to be bringing more air and ground units to the border - is Kuchum Khan’s
    plan offense or simply defense?
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene18.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "☉_☉ ... Wow. I guess this is where Brazil’s sending most of their new
    units. Those units are not to be sneezed at either - there are a LOT of XCOMs
    between those weaker paratroopers and mobile SAMs, and even some robot infantry.
    Per Civ AI game wizard /u/Admiral-Cloudberg, the Brazilians WON’T be expelled
    after a DoW - so Pedro could devour a huge part (potentially ALL) of the frontrunners’
    core if he wanted to, especially if the rest of Africa is as low on Boer units
    as this area."
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene19.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Sibir made a wise choice getting out of this war while they were ahead,
    now they (and Sweden) need to rebuild and carpet up - and with a military, not
    workers. It’s also worth noting that Sweden now has only a single land tile (south
    of Lappeenranta) connecting their Scandinavian core with their mainland Europe
    holdings.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene20.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The mostly empty new Boer lands would be vulnerable right now if any
    of their neighbours were in a state to attack them, which they are not. In other
    news, Sri Lanka and Armenia continue to exist and get in the way of Kruger’s Vietnam-bound
    units, and Exclavia continues to lack the units to get in anyone’s way.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene21.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Agra may be Vietnamese again, but Phu Xuan has been nuked off the map
    and the unit numbers are now decisively in Kruger’s favor. If the Trungs can’t
    hold him at the mountains their northern lands and damaged core will be looking
    very vulnerable. The minimap shows they haven’t even been able to kick Kruger
    out of southern India, which should have been easy.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene22.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    I think the local Vietnamese commander must be away on vacation. Seriously, I know the terrain sucks but you could at least try to take the city back. At least the advanced destroyer should do that next turn.
    Coiot‘s Note: Unintended benefit of Brazil‘s carpet for the Boers is being able to teleport new units closer to the front.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene23.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Vietnam continues to embark units without naval support, and the Australian
    cybersubs continue to use them for target practice. The Kimberly briefly consider
    doing something relevant with their overflowing units, but decide that would be
    too much effort.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene24.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Dong Hoi and Tianjin swap owners, but with only a near dead AA gun and
    some damaged biodrones as backup Australia looks to be evicted from Dong Hoi shortly.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene25.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: 'The middle east is still full of bordergore and absolutely no events
    of relevance. Tiridates has reportedly decided that being the chosen hero of prophecy
    is too hard and changed some flight schedules to land all those Brazilian units
    in Africa so Pedro could do it instead. #Tirigate'
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene26.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Agra predictably flips backs to Kruger. Vietnam has a better hope of
    holding to the north though, with mountains and Brazilians making troop movement
    a nightmare for invaders. Lahor in particular will be very difficult to capture,
    as there are no south-facing entrances through the surrounding mountains.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene27.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: A shot slightly further south reveals some Vietnamese backup has arrived
    around Balkh. Perhaps they will prove more effective than their predecessors?
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene28.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The days of the Boers not knowing what a naval unit was are long gone
    - and they’ve even managed to produce slightly more non-carrier units than carriers!
    They still don’t quite know how to get the ships to go somewhere they might actually
    be useful though. Also, more Brazilian overflow units. Are they a sign that the
    Boer Coer has also been flooded with lost Carnaval attendees, or merely a few
    lost stragglers?
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene29.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Furious at Tiridates’ abandonment of the prophecy, Parakramabahu briefly
    wakes from hibernation to plot vengeance. Please do it. Then maybe you’ll both
    accumulate enough of a warmongering penalty for Kruger to do the cylinder a favor
    and end you.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene30.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: A look at the capital city of one of the potential combatants (snort)
    reveals that Sri Lanka is growing its navy with the production of a nuclear submarine.
    Not sure what you’re planning to do to Armenia with that, maybe they’ve confused
    it with something else that’s cylindrical and nuclear?
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene31.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Hoi An, and Dong Hoi to the north have both been reclaimed. Hopefully
    Australia still has more units in real-world China than are on this slide, otherwise
    their Asian foothold is looking mightily tenuous.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene32.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Hordes of Blackfoot tourists and a Hawaiian great engineer crowd Japan.
    In Seoul, Sejong orders a nationwide broadcast to once again remind everyone how
    big and strong his navy is. Big Carrier executives stand at his shoulder, ensuring
    he sticks to their prepared script.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene33.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Oh boy. Apparently regretting his choice to let Ingolfur have Tonsberg,
    Gustavus orders his commanders to chuck all those ‘rebuilding’ plans out the palace
    window and declares war. The 61 visible Swedish aircraft (not counting the 3 missiles
    on cybersubs) immediately reduce put city in the black, and an organic infantry
    is positioned to take it next turn. Might want to move those 10 air units, Ingolfur.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene34.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Orleans, Cologne, Hamburg and Malmo are bombed straight into the black
    and Berlin is captured. Both sides lack units on the mainland, but damn, the Swedish
    airforce is not messing around. Gustavus also appears to have the naval advantage,
    with Iceland only displaying leftovers from CarrierCorp’s Pave The OceanTM initiative.
    At least some have planes on them.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene35.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Boer carrier party watches as Sweden captures Elis and Constantinople.
    Messene, Cumae, Tegea and Corinth are very weakly defended and in the black. Sweden
    has more units by far, but they’re mostly organic infantry versus Icelandic biotroopers
    and robot infantry. Will numbers or technology prevail?
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene36.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: And in a simultaneous DoW, Genghis has tired of hearing the echoes of
    Darkhan’s rapping over the mountains and resolved to deliver the final blow to
    the former number ones. He’s bought modern naval melee units to the party too,
    so we may be hearing the final lines of ‘Trigger’ Darkhan’s rapping career.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene37.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: It’s a new turn and Yakutia still exists, but that’s not important right
    now because… IT’S INUIT VS. ICELAND TIME. Finally, the White Walkers hear the
    pleas of their fans and declare war on someone they can actually reach. It’s time
    to see who the true ice people are.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene38.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: So naturally, we cut to a shot of the Boerabian desert. Kruger still
    hasn’t gotten around to annexing those captured Vietnamese cities, but he has
    settled Helsingborg and populated it with 6 air units.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene39.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Ingolfur wastes no time in scrambling reinforcements, and suddenly Sweden’s
    numerical advantage is almost gone. They did still manage to capture Corinth,
    Tegea and Messene, although a robot infantry and biotrooper of the fake ice people
    are about to take it back. Mantinea appears to have been nuked, with its population
    dropping from 13 to 9 and damaged units all around.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene40.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Tonsberg is Swedish again. Iceland still lacks anything resembling a
    real navy up here, but luckily for them Sweden forgot to build any naval melee
    units so Gustavus will struggle to capitalise on his superiority.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene41.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: And finally, we get to the war everyone (me) really wants to see. The
    Ice Sheet Fleet should clean up the Icelandic navy owing to their secret tactic
    of not being half carriers, but all those annoying peacekeepers will make it near
    impossible to penetrate further into greenland. Oh well, at least we’ll get the
    coastal cities and Iceland won’t be able to get any units in to reclaim them.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene42.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Okay. Pedro? It’s been ages since us Inuit fans got a good war, so please
    don’t mess this up for us. I mean it, if your peacekeepers make this end in a
    boring peace deal I’ll give the Carnaval a bad review on Yelp. Anyway, St Louis
    is bombed into the red but the surrounding Icelandic and Brazilian units will
    likely prevent a capture for the moment. Even more carriers down here, they’ll
    make good target practice.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene43.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The technologically inferior nations of the world shoot down a repeal
    of Scholars in Residence, co-led by Sam Houston from his battleship hideout. As
    the original headquarters of CarrierCorp the Buccs have certainly kept up with
    the world leaders in terms of useless navies. Maybe they’re using them to transport
    all their Giant Death Robots? I count 10 of those on this slide, which is a higher
    concentration than we’ve seen in any other civ as far as I recall.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene44.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Iceland’s superior units are starting to reach the front lines, and despite
    the nuke damage to many around Mantinea I predict that Sweden will have a tough
    time holding what they captured in the initial rush, let alone making any further
    gains. Messene and Tegea in particular seem likely to flip in the next turn or
    two.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene45.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Tianjin has flipped since we last saw it, but Vietnam still has more
    units in the area. Australia is running out of steam, and they won’t be able to
    easily reinforce. Now if only the Trungs could have the same success on their
    western front...
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene46.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The strategic map clearly shows the nuclear hellfire that both Kruger
    and the Trungs have unleashed on this front. Fallout covers the region, but the
    cybernetic and mutated warriors feel no fear. They have only one purpose, and
    emotion is irrelevant.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene47.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Sweden’s core hasn’t been spared the horrors of war, with Stockholm itself
    being caught in a nuclear blast radius. You brought this on yourself, Gustavus.
    I hope it was worth it. Also, as observant viewers may have noticed on the minimap...
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene48.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "..The power rankers have got their wish. Yakutia is no more. The last
    nuclear subs look on as Mongol choppers hover above the destroyed city walls,
    and an advanced destroyer sails triumphantly into the ruins of Beryozovo’s harbor.
    \ Ranked at the top spot in the Power Rankings from parts 1-7, Tygyn Darkhan ultimately
    failed to capitalise on his strong start. The Snoreyaks excelled at mediocrity,
    and of course ‘Trigger’ Darkhan’s beats. The most memorable deed of Yakutia was
    getting locked into a centuries-long meat grinder with the Inuit in Kamchatka,
    reducing the once pristine Arctic waters to a radioactive wasteland. Although
    the Koreans finally stomped their empire into the ground, the Snoreyaks persisted
    in this frozen city until the Mongols finally delivered the long sleep they had
    forever desired. Goodbye, Darkhan. May you drift forever though the heavens, propelled
    by your sick fires. F."

  narration: Unfortunately, Armenia is still here and they’ve just entered the information
    era. Which means we get another slide with them in it. Yay? Is there anything
    I can talk about that isn’t Armenia... looks at minimap ...oh hey, Vietnam kicked
    the Boers out of Southern India at some point! Sweden captured Cologne! So many
    interesting, non-Armenian world events!
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene50.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: 'Good news for Sweden: They snuck in a unit to capture Cologne, the British
    Isles are full of Brazilians rather than Icelanders and their navy has melted
    the Icelandic sea pavement fleet. Bad news: Iceland has bottled Sweden’s units
    up in Denmark, has Berlin mostly surrounded and will soon take back Cologne anyway
    because Sweden didn’t send reinforcements.'
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene51.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Iceland’s western navy is disintegrating as expected, and the Inuit have
    embarked melee units ready to assault Nattfaravik. Alternatively they could raze
    it to give one of those settlers hovering around Oshawa something to do.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: 52

  narration: Time for the Infoaddict slides. The Boers continue to lead substantially
    in population, but Brazil’s rise has not been constrained to military alone. They’ve
    overtaken the Inuit sometime in the last few parts to claim 3rd place. Vietnam
    has actually increased by 3 million since last part, surprisingly.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene53.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Mongolia manages to trail single city Hawaii, showing that despite their
    euthanasia of Yakutia they’re still far from being a serious contender. Sweden’s
    stubborn refusal to rebuild hasn’t done them any favors, and they’re sitting narrowly
    ahead of the Kimberly.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part98-scene54.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Boers and Inuit dominate in terms of production, with Australia sitting
    in 3rd place 8500 hammers behind. Brazil is only in 5th place with half that of
    the Inuit, which really demonstrates how much one of the top 2 could explode militarily
    if they put their minds to it. Kruger might want to consider that in light of
    the Brazilian occupation of Africa.

  narration: Mongolia are slightly less disappointing here, but still trail the pack
    of non-rump states. The large divide between Korea and Sweden doesn’t bode well
    for their war with Iceland in the long term.

  narration: Brazil continues to grow their military, as do the surprisingly high-ranked
    Blackfoot. I do wonder how well Future Worlds weights its units in this stat -
    empires with large but heavily outdated militaries seem to be disproportionately
    high-ranked. Despite Vietnam taking a huge hit to their military lately I would
    certainly back them over Mongolia in a war with their existing units.

  narration: The dead empires of Yakutia and Texas straddle our outdated sub. Yakutia’s
    subs will quite likely survive under the Arctic ice-sheets, so they’ll continue
    to be a fixture in these slides for some time.

  narration: Lutheranism’s presence in the high-pop Boer Core ensures it has almost
    as many followers as Arianism despite being less widespread. Australia leads both
    with Catholicism though.

  narration: With all 3 major religions converging on Europe it’ll be interesting
    to see if one dominates. And with that we come to the end of the part. This has
    been /u/AkraticCritic, and it’s been a pleasure to be a part of the CBR. See you
    all to get hyped for the next part!
