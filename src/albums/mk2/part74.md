    exciting part 74?. Shout out to TPang for the opportunity. A lot of questions

    their golden opportunity in South America? How long will it take for the Inuit
    to swallow yet another civilization? Will the Mongolians ever stop using Helicopters
    in all ways but the proper one? Stay tuned to find out in another exciting edition

  narration: "And here is the cylinder as we saw it last. We can see that the African
    coast continues to flip and the Inuit moving in. And let‘s not forget…. \n____________________\n|

  narration: Spherical Melon delivers a ridiculously high quality representation of
    the Boer Ryk. We here are Battle Royale (tm) can only be jealous as all hell of
    the consistent talent in this community.
- scene_number: "4"
  scene_title: 4
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene04.jpg
  narration: Despite the continent  of Africa falling under the leadership of a wisened
    biomechanical neckbearded Afrikaner, the Inuit still retain their top spot due
    to their potential to power through Yakutia‘s territory like piss through snow.
- scene_number: "5"
  scene_title: 5
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene05.jpg
  narration: Not many civs are left on our cylinder, but only 4 manage to remain neutral
    (albeit just because they aren‘t at war it doesn‘t mean there isn‘t a veritable
    slew of denouncements and passive-aggressive comments on other civ‘s facebook
    pages.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: 6
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene06.jpg
  narration: What a way to start! I believe this is the Inuit/Yakut front but can‘t
    really tell through all the smoke and radiation. Darkhan (Yakut) seems to have
    taken a leaf out of the Buccaneer chapter of How to Fight Wars Good. All the Inuit
    cities here are in the red or black but Darkhan doesn‘t exactly have an available
    strike team to do anything about it.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: 7
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene07.jpg
  narration: Another hazy war front this time in Central America. The Buccs have the
    clear tech advantage here and could be looking to make gains into Mexico. On another
    note the Australian subs had their bring your super old outdated unit to work
    day up in the top left.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene08.jpg
  narration: Here we see that recruit Ishtar made it to Osaka. Also notice the lack
    of enemy units. Looks like Meiji will survive. For now.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene09.jpg
  narration: And next to the Vietnamese mountain we have a couple Siberian nukes possibly
    preparing to nuke the Finns to oblivion. We also see a shot of newly acquired
    Sibirian Kabul with only an Afghan general in the area. Looks like they‘ll be
    holding on to that.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene10.jpg
  narration: And all of Nebbuchadnezzar‘s recruits have made it to their respective
    destinations so let‘s take a quick break from the action to see what they have
    to tell us.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene11.jpg
  narration: Looking at who‘s plotting against who we see a lot of fairly meaningless
    rump state politics. There probably won‘t be any important game hanging wars coming
    out of these.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene12.jpg
  narration: And here‘s a look at Kandahar, the new Afghan Capital after the fall
    of Kabul. A couple productive and workable tiles that would allow Hotak to stay
    alive to live another day if they can work out a peace deal. We can also see a
    Sibir hovertank picking off any odd melee units very close to the city so that
    peace deal better come soon.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene13.jpg
  narration: "Here we see Osaka where Japan has been surviving for a while now. Not
    many resources around and that cannon isn‘t going to repel prospective invaders
    if they manage to send more than one boat. For now however the Japanese are focused
    on their anime version of Pride and Prejudice. \n~uguuuuuu"
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene14.jpg
  narration: And another city view, this time at Ciudad Juarez. A lot of pillaged
    tiles to the south and east but the Mexican capital keeps chugging our troops
    to try and repel the Buccs and their power infantry squads we saw earlier.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene15.jpg
  narration: A shot of the European core here with the Bucc lands bare except for
    some radiation and some overworked workers. In other news Gustavus (Sweden) realized
    that he could never abolish leg day and makes peace with Leonidas. If there‘s
    one thing we can take away from this is never ever diss leg day.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene16.jpg
  narration: The Boers must really hate the citizens of Kumasi. Surrounded by hovertanks,
    Kumasi is not going fall unless the Boers get a melee unit in there. And when
    I say surrounded I mean like SURROUNDED. That‘s a lot of tanks for one city, even
    if it is a capital. At this point the city will just be bombarded to death, a
    sad end.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene17.jpg
  narration: Here we see what used to be Arrrrrfrica. No longer. All the Buccaneer
    cities we can see are in the black and the boers are in a great position to finally
    push the Buccs out with a GDR poised to take Bamako and plenty of units ready
    to go.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene18.jpg
  narration: Mess with the bull you get the nukes. Or something like that. It appears
    as if the Inuit didn‘t like being nuked (who would) and are preparing a strike
    of their own. The Inuit have the troops to support their strike though so this
    might spell trouble for the Yakut.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene19.jpg
  narration: A strategic view of the region shows radiation on both fronts of the
    wars with Khonuu flipping back to the Mongols but surrounded by the worst radiation
    of the region suggesting a nuclear strike. Maybe it wiped the helicopters out
    and forced the Mongols to find a new strategy. Hopefully.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene20.jpg
  narration: And there he is! The Ashanti pikeman finally learned how to embark into
    the sea and is heading back to Boer territory albeit a one tile island. Maybe
    he‘s looking for some vacation. Meanwhile the battle of the century is heating
    up as a Boer carrier faces off against a Vietnamese carrier. In all seriousness
    Vietnam has a decent army here. Perhaps a new front to the war?
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene21.jpg
  narration: Scratch that stuff I said about Kandahar possibly becoming a safe place
    for the Afghans to hole up. It‘s in the black with a Siberian power infantry within
    striking distance. Looks like we could see another death here folks. Prepare that
    F key.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene22.jpg
  narration: "Meanwhile in Korea:\nKorean general: Sir the Yakutians have been nuking
    people like crazy! what should we do?\nSejong: What are we gonna do, declare war?\nGeneral:
    Yes supreme leader. As you say. \nSejong: You‘re joking \nGeneral: You outlawed
    sarcasm yesterday remember?\nSejong: Ahh yes. Well get on with it then. And nuke
    something for the hell of it. We‘ll just say it was a test. \nTrue story. But
    anyway the Koreans already have Jokuskai surrounded and in the red. This definitely
    isn‘t Yakutias part."
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene23.jpg
  narration: A lot is going on in this slide. First a look at the remains of Etharabia
    with Jericho on the red. Thankfully for them, no enemy units are close (EXCEPT
    FOR THE GIANT RADIOACTIVE BOER SCORPIONS BUT THAT‘S OKAY NO NEED TO WORRY). Prime
    the F keys. The Jewish Inquisitor seems to have lost his protector as he wanders
    towards Gaza only now believing the stories of his homeland in red and gray. You‘ve
    got to feel sorry for them as now Hotak (Afghanistan) Is plotting against them.
    It seems as if the world is trying to stop the Jewish Inquisition from happening
    before it even starts. Yakutia also has made peace with Sibir in hopes of strengthening
    their eastern front.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene24.jpg
  narration: And the Ashanti just can‘t get a break. Besides Mexico plotting against
    everyones favorite pikeman, look what Vietnam did! Just as the Ashanti were about
    to enjoy a nice relaxed beachfront vacation, Vietnam decided to spite the Ashanti
    and snipe the hot bed of the nice relaxed beachfront activities. The Ashanti are
    left with only their pool of tears to swim in, a sad replacement to nice relaxed
    beachfront activities.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene25.jpg
  narration: And now Meiji is in on the plotting, this time against Anawrahta (Burma).
    And although Burma has been dead for a while now (since part 44, although rumour
    has it that a musician still roams the seas around Arabia entertaining sailors
    for a twenty), the Japanese might become a bit too greedy with their plotting
    and anger a legitimate power. Maybe not such a smart idea. While Japanese cannons
    are mighty, they‘re also cannons. And there‘s one so…..
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene26.jpg
  narration: My point exactly. Here we see the Kimberly fleet, now with more boats
    (a groundbreaking strategy) and a nuke. Shooting a nuke with a cannon is difficult
    and won‘t really prevent the nuke from ravaging the land but don’t tell Meiji
    that
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene27.jpg
  narration: Goodbye for now Arrrrrfrica. We might see you again, we might not. Personally
    I want rum to rule the world but that glorious dream might have to be put on hold.
    The Boers have landed a hovertank in Iberia so it could be the start of Boerope.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene28.jpg
  narration: An Icelandic fleet armed with a nuke seem to be lost in the warm waters
    of the pacific. Or are they? The Buccs core is still void of anything but workers,
    but the Icelandic troops would have to go through the wall of carriers, a daunting
    task in itself.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene29.jpg
  narration: The Yakutians seem to have defended Jokuskai not too shabbily. It‘s still
    in the red but not as many sarcasm deprived Koreans surround it. Druzhna has also
    been lowed to the red however with Korean reinforcements ready in the south to
    go to either city.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene30.jpg
  narration: Speak of the devil and he shall appear. I eat my words again as the Koreans
    power through and grab Jokusai. A GDR is ready to take Druzhna and free up the
    hovertanks to harass the Yakut settler who is just in the wrong place at the wrong
    time.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Inuit have a GDR of their own ready to take Verkhnevilyuysk (say
    that 5 time fast). There seems to be every color of unit surrounding it except
    brown and blue. The Yakuts are really losing ground here and with two superpowers
    pushing on their core, they might not make it out of this one.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene32.jpg
  narration: Ass-kicking ahoy ya landlubbers. The Buccs are back and they‘re all out
    of bubble gum. They have retaken most of the cities they lost the last time we
    looked here and Iceland has gotten in in the action. Now all the Boer cities are
    on the black and a Bucc paratrooper, after a rousing pep talk and a bottle of
    rum has landed alone in the heart of the Boers primed to snipe Quarzazate. With
    some luck they could actually hold it as the nearest Boer units are workers and
    a hovertank.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene33.jpg
  narration: Vietnam is trying to take Middleberg, another one tile Boer city. Their
    plans of taking it with one boat (seriously the AI strategy is golden) should
    be foiled by the drone laden carriers sporadically placed around this shot.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene34.jpg
  narration: And the walls of Jericho have fallen. The Ethiopians had a good run,
    building up a sizable empire in east Africa and Arabia but being so close to the
    Boers was always going to be a huge hurdle for Selassie. RIP.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene35.jpg
  narration: A shot of Boer East Africa with more workers than units. Baghdad is in
    yellow but with only one hovertank attacking the Boers would be hard pressed to
    keep it if they could take it. Which they can’t because of the whole hovertank
    thing.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene36.jpg
  narration: And the Boers are angry. Not much emotion affects the cyboergs these
    days, but prevent the Ashanti from nice relaxing beachfront activities?  DEATH.
    I mean 4 nukes is probably overkill. At this point what would remain of that strike
    wouldn‘t make nice relaxing beachfront activities enjoyable.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene37.jpg
  narration: The Ashanti realize this and begrudgingly make their way back to the
    mainland noticing the Vietnamese border gore cutting Sri Lanka in two. They might
    want to talk to the inquisitor about freeing their respective homelands.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene38.jpg
  narration: And the Boers have repelled the Bucc push and are preparing a push of
    their own. This remains one of the most fluctuating fronts of the entire BR. One
    turn you think the Buccs are gonna hold their land and he next the Boers have
    purged them out. Makes for great action and makes my job easy (except for the
    whole predicting part)
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene39.jpg
  narration: Jokusai is still in the possession of the Koreans but the Yakuts have
    units nearby ready to flip it back. Druzhna is now in the black and will fall
    soon. Meanwhile in the top right Verkhnevilyuysk is also in the red. Worse news
    for the Yakut… The Mongol helicopters survived and are coming from the southeast.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene40.jpg
  narration: And the nukes just keep falling. This time in Arabia. It looks like both
    sides were nuked and there‘s a nice fallout patch to commemorate the ruins of
    Damascus. Afghanistan keeps plotting against dead Civs just to make them feel
    powerful again.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene41.jpg
  narration: Meiji has made peace with Leonidas as Koreans naval carpet extends close
    and closer to mainland Japan. A Finnish paratrooper is just “passing through”
    while two more look on from the north ready for their orders. Soon the hologram
    of Emperor Kekkonen could crackle through, “Execute order 66”.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene42.jpg
  narration: A look now to the Mexican front where even the combatants can‘t tell
    if they‘ve been nuked again due to the insane amount of smoke. Ciudad Juarez is
    still in the red but has been reinforced by friendly Mexican units who are still
    out-teched by the Buccs
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene43.jpg
  narration: An Icelandic Great Musician plays a mournful song to commemorate the
    lives and AI lost in the most recent glassing of West Africa and even Iberia.
    The death by nukes toll is getting higher and higher. Don‘t you just wish the
    World Council would abolish them? That was the first thing the AI in Civ IV would
    do….
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene44.jpg
  narration: In a shot of North Africa it appears that Iceland unloaded their arsenal
    we saw last part here as well. No Boer is safe from the strength of suns. The
    Bucc holdings here are under siege from the Boers who demand revenge for their
    West African friends slain by the atom bomb. Boers don’t hate these cities as
    much as Kumasi but thats still a sizeable army.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene45.jpg
  narration: More nukes are being prepared and fired as Olenyok and Mukhtuy are in
    the red and surrounded by the Yakut Navy and a mighty worker, killer of Inuit,
    conqueror of cities,  protector of Yakut, and all that jazz.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene46.jpg
  narration: Korea continues to gobble up Yakutian territory with terrifyingly passive
    ease.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene47.jpg
  narration: A strategic view of the north again with the same radiation problem that
    most people are having. The Inuit haven‘t made a large amount of progress this
    part but again keep slowly pushing through the Yakut. The addition of the Koreans
    to the war definitely will open the Yakut up even more.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene48.jpg
  narration: Well it looks like the Buccs are getting a taste of their own medicine
    as multiple nukes are unleashed on Buccaneer Spain. The best news for the Buccs
    right now is that their caravel wasn‘t blown to bits.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part74-scene49.jpg
  narration: "Here we have a good look at the Tibetan city of Lhasa guarded by an
    invincible army….. Of caravans. But an army is an army and if you want to build
    a metric buttload of caravans go ahead. To each his own. \nThat‘s all folks. See
    you next time on the Battle Royale!"
