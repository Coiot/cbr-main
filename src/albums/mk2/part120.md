  narration: "<p>Hello, and welcome to the action. Reon Monterus here, computer watcher and part poster for the CBR. Let’s jump right in. Here we see Brazilian troops advancing on Pori. How long with the battalion of loyal Sibir Biotroopers last against the onslaught on Brazilian Robot Infantry? I’m confident we will soon see.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the one front where Sibir seems to hold a distinct advantage over Brazil. Still bitter over the loss of their capital, the Sibirian Air Wing pounds the newly captured cities of Dila, Iskar, and Tyumen into fine paste to keep Brazil from gaining any benefit. They also flood forth both Biotroopers and Robot Infantry, pushing to try to reclaim some land before the inevitable second wave of Brazilian troops arrives.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On this front Brazil is again at an advantage, surrounding Otrar and moving in on Beshbalik and Karakorum. How soon will Pedro be able to add another capital to his list? Only time will tell but it is interesting that these cities have not taken much damage. Perhaps Pedro’s air force is busy elsewhere?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The captured Brazilian pocket containing Khonuu and Tiflis seems to be holding, but only just. While this area is no stranger to war with these cities having been beaten down and rebuilt several times at this point. I’ll also take a moment to note here the recent annexations of these cities by Sibir. It looks like they are pressing any and all production they can find to supplant their troops.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Now we turn to the frigid north where the final Inuit stronghold stands, their backs to the famous Ice Sheet Fleet, or what remains of it. Fighting with whatever units they can find including some outdated Artillery they must have dragged out of a museum. Here we can see some of the influence of Big Carrier, with 4 empty Carriers sitting in the middle of the fleet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The last Inuit pacific holdings look a bit worse for wear with a pile of embarked Brazilian units inbound. Brazil’s ability to mostly avoid dealing with Big Carrier has certainly proved to be a boon in this fight as we can see a Carrier free navy here on this slide.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over to Korean lands we see a Brazilian fleet of Advanced Destroyers lurking off the coast while Biotroopers and Robot Infantry roll in from the north. Hiroshima, never rebuilt much from being the first city nuked, stands on the coast waiting for the inevitable green tide to roll in.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the final stand of the Trung Sisters. They have moved their capital to Than Hoa, and stationed their last troops outside. I am sure the Sisters stand tall in the city square, firing off orders and preparing the city for the hell they know is only a short time away.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sliding out to the Pacific, we can see the relative peacefulness of the northern Hawaiian possessions, now under the rule of Henry Parkes. While a lone Advanced Destroyer threatens Mililani Mauka, the city has plenty of health to handle the single ship attacking. For now at least.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Looking at the Philippines now we see Brazil is only slowly advancing on this front. They seem more interested in dealing with the Vietnamese in their backfield than pushing here for the moment, but I’m sure the time will come when these cities fall.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Out to the Hawaiian islands proper and their former capital Honolulu we see only a smattering presence of either sides units. This being so close to the Brazilian homeland you might expect a bigger force here but Pedro seems to want to keep his forces close to home in the Pacific.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back to Korea we see that Ulsan is now showing a sporting green color, and Osaka is now down to half health and has several units moving in. It seems Brazil is interested in bringing it’s fellow vanilla civ into the fold first amongst the remaining combatants.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Than Hoa, Phong Chau, and Saigon all fall for Vietnam. In the race to who is out first this part, it certainly seems like Vietnam is “winning”. Surrounded by units and with one city at low health, it would not surprise me if they fell first.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The two Inuit islands of Sikutsipmaik and Ahkaitikokakinik fall, along with the short lived capital Akviligjuaq. The Inuit capital moves much farther away from the line now to Saudarkrokur, hopefully to hold out as long as possible.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In central Asia we see that Tiflis has flipped back to Sibirian control. Although likely not long lived this is a bit of an upset for Kuchum Khan who up until now had been ceding land on every front. Does this mean the grey wall has stopped the green wave? We shall see.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And Vietnam is the first to fall! Coming in 6th is no small feat for the Trung Sisters who seemed both brilliant and incompetent at times in this game. Several times it seemed the Trungs were either rolling momentum in their favor, or building useless units and fighting a pointless meatgrinder of a war with Sibir. There is a eulogy slide later for them so I won’t drag this on much here, but to say that Vietnam earned it’s spot at number 6.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zamboanga looks poised to fall as yet another Brazilian fleet surrounds it. Also to note, there are three Carriers in this slide and all three have airplanes on board. Brazil knowing how to use a navy is certainly helping them with these island hopping invasions.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a surprise twist Honolulu falls! I was not expecting to see this for some time considering the apathy Brazil had shown in the previous turns but it sees they are now interested in these islands. Add one more capital to Pedro’s roster.</p>"

I will be your guide through the next few turns of action, let’s get to it! </p><p></p><p>Brazilian troops push into Verkhoturye, but they don’t seem to have much of an advantage as far as numbers or troop makeup goes against Sibir. Good thing there are waves of Brazilian troops on the backlines to slowly beat their way forward. Notably, Sibir has dozens of planes on the frontline keeping every Brazilian city on the screen in the red, but a lack of troops makes their work fruitless. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Brazil picks up another capital by storming the gates of Karakorum. The anguished cries of Genghis Khan can be heard echoing through the subs as his former citizens fall subject to yet another ruler. More ex-Mongolian territory is taken as well, connecting Khonuu to the rest of Brazil’s territory.</p><p></p><p>Beshbalik crumbles...</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mid Baffin falls, as Brazil directly crosses the Bering Strait for the first time all game. Of interest is that Mid Baffin actually loses population here, indicating Brazil isn’t yet at dominant influence over every civ yet. How ironic for this culture based civ.</p><p></p><p>In the north, Inuit cybersubs lurk . . . waiting</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brazil has nearly completed their takeover of Hawai’i with their capture of Waikiki and Hilo.

  narration: "<p>Like any Dagwood sandwich (does anyone even get this reference?), Korea was once a towering stack of diverse ham, roast beef, lettuce, onion, pickle and more. I mean, those beautifully advanced Korean cities boasting many a world wonder and gold leafed pillar. Anyways, they’re now being crushed so they can fit in the widening maw of the Pedro. Mmmm… tasty!</p>"

  narration: "<p>A lone Brazilian Robot Infantry captures Batam. There’s not much action on this front at the moment, neither civ seems particularly interested in jumping the gap and fighting on mainland Australia quite yet. Also remember how I assumed Australia was keeping their troops on the mainland rather than on those islands? It appears I’m just wrong and Australia barely has any troops. Sad.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Up in the frigid north, Brazil captures three cities -- Surgut, Mosul and Lahti -- from Sibir. A couple appear tenuous as they’re surrounded by Sibirian troops but I doubt I’m willing to bet Brazilian reinforcements will be here soon enough. </p>"

  narration: "<p>So this is where it ends for Sejong, stuck in his very last city while Brazilian troops bear down from all angles. With the fall of Wonju and Kanazawa and troops fleeing left and right like a good aioli drips out of a sandwich, Pedro’s stomach grumbles. At least Sejong still has a Great Engineer left to build him a beautiful tomb.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Brazil completes their Hawaiian campaign with the capture of Kahului, although it looks like Australia did put up a valiant effort by flipping Hilo once before Brazil retook it. This brings up a considerable advantage for Brazil, in that because they were so lowly ranked when the reboot happened they go considerably later in the turn order than almost all of the civs left, beginning many parts ago. I wonder if anything would have been different if they’d gone first?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah yes, this is why Pedro doesn’t appear to have a large army marching on Australia. Because XCOMs are a thing, so they just paratroop in from across the world and take cities. Like Rubibi. Just like that.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And so ends the reign of Sejong. A middling turtle throughout most of the game, Korea have been ranked as low as 61st (Part 3) and as high as 3rd (Part 78), highlighting just how divisive their abilities have seemed. Anyways, since I’m terrible at writing eulogies, I will stop talking, and hopefully someone can do a better job than I. </p><p></p><p>F.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In other news, the Inuit are crumbling. Since we last saw them, Brazil now has a dominating foothold in Russia and is slowly forcing the Inuit into the ocean. Judging by the number of Brazilian melee units and the lack of any Inuit units at all that could be of any use, the Inuit will also fall in a matter of turns.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As we get our first look in a long time at South-Western Australia, it’s immediately obvious Brazil has captured both Windjana and nuked Mowanjum a couple times. Also, Brazilian XCOMs have arrived to take a hike up Uluru (why didn’t they just drop onto the top? Are they bad at jumping into the right place? I thought XCOMs were the pros? Exposed?)</p><p></p><p>Anyways, this is Limerickarcher signing off for now, thanks to you the community so much for an amazing MK2(.1) and supporting us throughout the entire development process! I began working on this project almost two years ago, and I can say with confidence I’m proud to be a Babylonian.</p><p></p><p>Before I leave you in the capable hands of Coiot / Volpe, one technical note on the upcoming slides.

I was not prepared coming into this narration to witness such atrocity mixed with creativity. Perhaps mini-Pedro has merely just invented a new artform. From referencing the map and previous slides, I cannot tell who is responsible as Port Macquarie was last seen in Brazilian hands and Quezon was in danger of flipping.

It’s unlikely that it’ll be the last city unless Kuchum makes one last assault and take the city from it’s death.</p>"

The city, ravaged by war, loses its name in defiance of the new overlord. It’s now finally over for Sibir. You can close your eyes sweet prince. You had an empire that truely outstretched the world and your strength would have truly made any Russian proud. You lived a proud life, but alas sweet prince. You must sleep.</p><p></p><p>For now, his eyes close. For now, he sleeps. Goodbye Kuchum, thanks for the ride. F.</p>"

Entire parts were dedicated to the battles waged on this continent, and like paint, it covers it all in a beautiful hue. I wonder though, does Brazil think they are liberating them?</p>"

  narration: "<p>With Cairns crumbling to the offence, and Canberra beginning to hear the robotic steps of soldier on their wake, I could imagine acceptance of their future assimilation into the almighty robotic hoard. Brazil has taken over the Hypermind, and now accepts the goal to assimilate every non-robotic overlord. Those with mere chips in their head get stripped of all their flesh and bone and rebuilt into a better life form. Natural life given beautiful perfect form. This is the final form of the Hypermind.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The ocean life is a lot less obvious, with many cities never seen the war now witnessing hordes of infantry made out of synthetic metals move to their shore. They believed the world was safe and kind, but as even Ardyaloon begins to be assimilated, the Australians just wait, clinging onto their antiquated Artillery in Wollongong and Townsville. Even Wollongate cannot hold back the menace. Brazil has surpassed the power of even Gods and mythical inventions. I wonder if they think that the sub is an antiquated technology to be hoisted in a museum. Would Nebuchadnezzar accept such a fate?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Wow, sorry about this. Imagining the society as it crumbles has always been an interest of mine. But let’s look at something practical. There’s more melee units surrounding Marselle, Hobart and Royadanga then Australia has. Sunshine Coast seems to be the new jump off point for the south Australian continent. The core is open and Perth takes the first bit of damage in a very very long time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As Maori nuclear fallout surrounds Sydney, the nuclear pain begins to ring closer and closer and closer. It’s hard to tell if some of that is new. Perhaps the chaos and obliteration is beginning to come too close to home. I remember when recording was made to be 24/7. It wasn’t long after it started, but we wondered if we would reach the point where whole turns would take weeks. It was a fear thought of when turn times were taking hours, but now with weeks upon weeks.</p>"

Each atoll city become swept away in the waves of troops. The iron wave washes ashore of Geraldton and soon many others. Just how long will they last?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The troubles of scenario building in a nutshell. Due to how each city functions, each city reacts differently to borders. Some cities they don’t think are theirs, and some tiles despite being right outside the city are often never used. Upon flipping, they also don’t register properly. Thus why we’re witnessing the huge hug that Whanganui is receiving from newly Brazilian Nukuhau; which considering what mainland Australia is experiencing is an oddly fitting name.</p>"

If I want to pull anything from here to talk about, it’d be the insane year the game thinks it’s in, like seriously 6121AD?! Also notice how high population most of the nearby cities are.

  narration: "<p>Speaking of unhappy, Australia is crumbling. The fortress is collapsing and even Whanganui-a-tara finds within its bounds, and even Melbourne is getting the notification to attack. Australia’s once fearful trash fleet of Diggers and dreams is gone, and now everything is laid bare. Much like the battle of Iceland and Sweden, the waterways are open for chaos, the problem is the unit is stronger, faster and more agile then Parkes will ever be. This is a game lost a long time ago, we’re just waiting for the final flip.</p>"

Much like the war in the Pacific during World War Two; the goal isn’t to fight over small islands, but eliminate all ships from the water so you can sail in, and as the last fortresses of Australia fell, there’s nothing left. It’s all over. Praise Pedro.</p>"

I wonder what it’s like in the Australian parliament; that is if the constant losses didn’t send Henry Parkes into hiding. As he sips his rare imported Chardonnay and reminices what happened. Could the clock turn back and a new world be born with Australia at the top and Brazil out of the world. He wishes silently. But God heeds his call.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A cup is hoisted over Pedro’s head, as the final mantle of a defeated enemy is brought to his feet; although not all is perfect as some cities remain yet to be subjugated, as we can see only one melee unit in this shot, even moving down to some behind the scenes images will find only one cybersub and a bio-soldier coasting alone off the Maori capital. It’s truly and finally over. There’s no way they can capture it back; Australia like many others finds it all crumbling about them. Without a doubt, every city would turn lime-green, but seeing as we wanted to release the part this month instead of next month, we opted to halt progress here. Caked in nuclear fire. Now, I would have the final say if all else is equal, but I want to hand it off to the leader of Blue Cassette for some special news.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hi, it’s Reon again, welcome to the end of the CBR Mk2.1! It’s been quite the ride these last years, both watching and working on this project, but it’s finally come to a conclusion. We in Blue Cassette have learned a lot running this game for all of you, lessons we have and will apply to the next iteration, CBRX Season 1. I know you are hoping for news on the release date for CBRX S1, and while I don’t have anything to say yet, I can confidently tell you that the game is currently recording and we should decide on a launch date soon. You can expect not only more of the same style of content as we have had for the CBR Mk2.1, but we’re planning to make even more stuff for you to enjoy. It’s been great working for this community. It is a great pleasure each week to see the part drop and the discussions and creations commence and we look forward to that occurring for some time to come. Speaking of part drops, we do have one final thing planned for next week, a bonus part if you will, as a community look back on all of the participants of the CBR Mk2.1. So stay tuned for that and for more info on the CBRX!</p><p></p><p>Coiot’s Edit: Wednesday the 20th</p>"
