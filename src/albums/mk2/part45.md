  narration: |-
    Welcome back one and all to this 45th installment of the Official r/Civ 60+ Civ Battle Royale!
    I‘m u/Samarkhannor, proprietor of AI games over on r/civAIgames and extreme Mongol fanboy. I‘ll be your host for this episode; I hope you enjoy your stay! As we ended the last part, Burma had been taken out, the Maori had nuked and captured Sydney, and war had broken out in Kamchatka; where shall this part take us?
    Special thanks to many of our subreddit users for these polandballs!

    The Inuit remain on top of the Power Rankings this time around, followed by the Boers, and Australia respectively!

  narration: Anyway, let‘s get to it! The Maori are still holding on to Sydney after
    their against-all-odds capture of the Aussie capital, but it won‘t last long.
    Tasmania and Polynesia have fallen into Parkes (Australia)‘s hands, although the
    once-mighty Wobbegong is looking mighty thin.
- scene_number: "6"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene06.jpg
  narration: In the Second Kamchatka War, Igloolik and Suntar change hands between
    the Inuit and Yakutia. Darkhan (Yakutia)‘s former fleet in the Sea of Okhotsk
    is looking rather... former. A small branch of the Wobbegong Armada watches on,
    happy to be far from any war that it would actually have to fight in.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene07.jpg
  narration: Ethiopia arranges a significant arrangement of artillery and GWIs to
    wreck Carthage, but if Haile (Ethiopia) isn‘t careful, Sparta‘s fleet will steal
    all his potential gains, as it already has with Alexandria and the all-important
    Dvin Canal. A despondent Ayyubid great general stares at the chaos mournfully,
    having no land in which to plant a citadel, and no troops to which he can boost
    the combat strength.
- scene_number: '08'

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene08.jpg
  narration: Morocco and Mali sit blissfully unaware of the violence occurring at
    the other end of Africa. But a bunch of knights aren‘t going to hold long when
    the orange menace awakens and thirsts from more land, and Mansa Musa (Mali)‘s
    land holds a source of precious uranium, ever-important in the post-nuclear world.
- scene_number: '09'

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene09.jpg
  narration: Akbar‘s attack on Anuradhapura has long since evaporated, and Lahore
    is looking as endangered as a Pangolin. Korea and Persia throw moral support in
    behind Sri Lanka. A Burmese Great Musician flees his burning homeland, escorted
    by a rifleman, to join the Secret Society of Stateless Musicians.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene10.jpg
  narration: An immense black shadow looms to the north of Brazil, and a smaller yet
    more effective black shadow actually deals damage in the west. Belo Horizonte
    is back in Buccaneer hands, and Pedro (Brazil)‘s resistance is looking weak and
    a bit heavy on helicopter gunships (not known for their city-flipping abilities.)
    Further to the west, Chile consolidates its hold over the former Incan capital
    in Cusco as Pachacuti (The Inca) flees north amid a brigade of rifles.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene11.jpg
  narration: The Finnish carpet draws a sharp contrast with the empty Sibirian frontier,
    and with the technologically backwards (by comparison) Swedes in the west. Should
    Kekkonen (Finland) be awakened by someone other than Arabia, the North will forever
    be altered. In the background, the Buccs flip yet more Brazilian cities.
- scene_number: "12"

  narration: All the Khan‘s ships and all the Khan‘s planes don‘t seem to do much
    good against the White Walkers, who are on the offensive despite an apparent lack
    of an air force.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene13.jpg
  narration: Sydney at last returns to Australian hands, and now the Beast Down Under
    has truly been awakened. Isolated to New Zealand and surrounding islands (and
    a small swathe of Central America), the Maori are quickly running out of options,
    and must act fast before more ships start arriving.

  narration: |-
    Despite being majorly culled, Jandamarra (Kimberley) is still able to enter the atomic era. Unfortunately, it‘s come a bit too late.
    Also, friendly reminder that the Blackfoot still own a city in the Philippine archipelago.
- scene_number: "15"

  narration: Amongst the Siberian steppes, our trusted agent Semiramis discovers that
    Kuchum Khan (Sibir) is working towards acquiring The Bomb. The nuclear arms race
    shall soon be in full tilt.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene16.jpg
  narration: Recruit Ishtar reveals the Finland is plotting to finish off Norway,
    but Urho (Finland) will have to act fast to do the job before Sweden does. And
    by 'fast' i mean 'within the next turn.' Prepare to say goodbye to Snoreway.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene17.jpg
  narration: I was wrong-- perhaps the Maori still have one more trick up their sleeve,
    even if it‘s the same one they pulled before. A lone caravel sails straight back
    into Sydney on a glorious suicide mission, sticking one final (?) middle finger
    in the face of the unstoppable Australian Empire. Sorry TPang, but I‘m really
    enjoying seeing Australia finally get put in its place after all these years of
    doing too well. Now if only someone could do it to the Boers.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene18.jpg
  narration: Sejong walks out of his palace, and holds a Samsung Galaxy S6 up to the
    light. 'We have it! We finally have it! A new time is upon our people-- a time
    of information! And we‘d like to inform you that the Boers entered this era quite
    a few parts ago, so we‘ve got some catching up to do!'
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene19.jpg
  narration: |-
    Meanwhile, Mongolia finally has planes and great war infantry. I doubt this means anything to anyone else, but it‘s really exciting for me.
    Finland plots against yet another civ, this time France. Of more pressing concern is that a backdoor Carthaginian fleet is on the verge of taking Rome, in what could be a roundabout act of revenge for the Second Punic War.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene20.jpg
  narration: Wow, Te (The Maori) sure has a lot of fight left in him. Against all
    odds, he holds onto Sydney and retakes a city that I won‘t bother to type out
    on Tasmania. However, he‘s in danger of losing Taihape, and allowing the Digger-idoos
    a foothold on the North Island.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene21.jpg
  narration: All good things must come to an end, and Sydney returns again to its
    rightful owners, along with Tasmania. The Aussies also grab the aforementioned
    foothold on the North Island, further threatening the Kiwis with sudden destruction.
    Meanwhile, Iceland acquires nuclear capabilities-- will the smell of split atoms
    be enough to wake them from their slumber?
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene22.jpg
  narration: Oh shit, it looks like it‘s time to say bye-bye to North America‘s next
    weak link! The Blackfoot, already distracted fighting Canada, are attacked by
    Mexico, and have hardly a handful of land units to hold on to their empire. If
    the Inuit join in, they‘re really fucked. At least if worst comes to worst, they‘ll
    have that nice island resort in Olongapo to retreat to.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene23.jpg
  narration: Carthage can do little to stop Ethiopia‘s advance, and Haile (Ethiopia)
    is already plotting his next attack. Liking the taste of conquest, he‘s trying
    to catch up as fast as possible before the inevitable Boer DOW.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene24.jpg
  narration: 'However, Carthage isn‘t going out without a bang of its own, as Hannibal
    grabs Rome from the clutches of Leonidas (Sparta). Upon entering the city, the
    general has but one command: Salt the fields.'
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene25.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka finally gets a grip around the port of Lahore, and begins gathering
    momentum around Fatehpur Sikri as well. However, they‘ll want to upgrade their
    cannons if they want to get anywhere further with the war.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene26.jpg
  narration: Back up in Kamchatka, a Finnish trireme slowly ploughs the icy waters
    of the Bering Sea as the Snowy Showdown rages on around. Sendai falls into Yakkish
    hands, but it is doomed to flip.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene27.jpg
  narration: The Last Legion, yet further separated from its brother the ballista,
    remembers fondly of the days that it had an empire to go home to. Now, Rome is
    just another piece in another war between two more powerful civs, and will never
    again see its righteous owners.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene28.jpg
  narration: Fortaleza, Sao Luis, and Manaus all fall under the black banner, while
    yet another wave of Brazilian resistance gathers. Slowly, the armies of both civs
    are being worn down, but the Corsair Fleet is remaining intact.
- scene_number: "29"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene29.jpg
  narration: Faced with a more pressing threat from Mexico, Crowfoot of the Blackfoot
    peaces out with Canada, getting to keep Itazipcho. In the south, Ahahpitape is
    looking like a fine location for a new burrito joint.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene30.jpg
  narration: Ahahpitape falls to Mexico as a lost and lonely Irish scout watches on,
    wondering if tequila mixes well with Guinness. I‘m guessing it probably doesn‘t.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Qashliq Olympic Games take place, as Sibir put in the greatest chunk
    of the whopping 44,640 production needed to complete the event. Yakutia comes
    off with the most medals, winning in the Nordic skiing, Yak-racing, and Olympic
    sleeping events. Surprisingly missing from the list of highest contributors is
    the Boers, who were too busy doing Other Things.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene32.jpg
  narration: |-
    The International Games gives a 100% boost to tourism to Sibir, allowing them to rival Australia for the 20 turns that it lasts. Too bad this is a domination-only game.
    TPang‘s note: Brazil at some points do take over Australia in terms of Tourism
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene33.jpg
  narration: Sparta finally retakes Olympia, its long-lost African colony, but Carthage
    has the means to retake it. Notably, Sweden has essentially given up on attacking
    Sparta, as there are simply far too many Boer units in the way.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene34.jpg
  narration: Yakutia decides it doesn‘t have enough wars on its hands and attacks
    Chile, who shrugs it off as yet another irrelevant conflict. Meanwhile, a Buccaneer
    backdoor fleet is sneaking through Bernardo (Chile)‘s waters to strike Brazil
    from behind.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene35.jpg
  narration: Two Maori triplanes on an aircraft carrier hold their final stand against
    a fair-sized flotilla of Australian ships. Their sacrifices shall be remembered
    as long as Aotearoa lives.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene36.jpg
  narration: Oh damn. It‘s the scourge of the high seas versus the Frozen Chosen--
    The Inuit have attacked the Buccaneers! A few parts ago this would‘ve been fairly
    irrelevant, but now Ekeuhnick (The Inuit) has several undefended ports on the
    gulf of Mexico, and Henry Morgan of the Buccs has a lot of corsairs itching for
    plunder. However, if the glacial gladiators bring some units in to defend their
    Texan holdings, the pirates may be in deep trouble.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene37.jpg
  narration: For the moment, however, the Inuit seem more concerned with gaining ground
    on the Yakutian front, and have done just that with the capture of Isit. Backed
    by paratroopers and missile cruisers, Ekeuhnick (The Inuit) is clearly taking
    the advantage.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene38.jpg
  narration: |-
    Frost-coated helicopters begin arriving at Petit-Goave; are the days of Floridarr numbered?
    In other news, The Inuit have a nice stack of caravans going on in Houston.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene39.jpg
  narration: Corsairs begin raiding Inuit ports, and land units arrive by sea to help
    secure Petit-Goave. This could be a long, drawn out war if neither side throws
    their full weight into it.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene40.jpg
  narration: "Well, RIP Maori. Wairau and Ngaruawahia fall, and Parihaka itself is
    almost on the verge of being taken. At least Te (Maori) will know that he certainly
    went out with a bang and left his mark on the world. \n(Let‘s ignore the Moarexico
    for added drama for now)"
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene41.jpg
  narration: Time to press F to pay respects for Norway, as they are up in heaven
    now. Only three Scandinavian powers remain (Iceland counts, right?), and none
    are going down any time soon, but it had to come at the cost of someone. And Haakon
    Haakonson drew the short straw.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene42.jpg
  narration: Carthaginian troops retake Bilbais and Olympia, but Antium is slipping
    lower and their core (if you can even call it that) is looking dangerously empty.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene43.jpg
  narration: While a line of great artists charges towards Blackfoot lands, Mexico
    decides to start more wars for itself and attacks Chile. Embarking all of his
    units while the Blackfoot fleet is still strong might not end up too well for
    Benito (Mexico), however.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene44.jpg
  narration: Imbued with a new sense of purpose with the revelation of the Inuit conflict,
    Buccaneer troops in the Amazon push further than ever before, capturing Teresina.
    However, their forces are thin and reinforcements are nowhere to be seen; the
    South American affair may have to soon come to an end.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene45.jpg
  narration: Sparta retakes Rome and captures Antium. The fields must for now be unsalted.
    In the background, the Maori retake two cities.
- scene_number: "46"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene46.jpg
  narration: Bombing runs take Fatehpur Sikri down to half health, and Akbar (the
    Mughals)‘s Farsakh Cannons aren‘t looking so strong against marines.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene47.jpg
  narration: Shit just got real in the Pirate-Igloo war, as Ekeuhnick (The Inuit)
    brings a nuclear missile to a gunfight. Morgan (The Buccs) will need to capture
    Albany fast before the force of a split atom will be unleashed on his tropical
    realm.
- scene_number: "48"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene48.jpg
  narration: With the denizens of Sydney still licking their wounds and sawing off
    their third arms, Parihaka is taken, consummating Australia‘s revenge against
    the poor Kiwis. And they never even got to finish their final insult, the Sydney
    Opera House.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene49.jpg
  narration: The Inuit have already acquired a corsair, as the technologically inferior
    Arrmada is beaten back on the pacific side of the Nassau Canal. The Ice Sheet
    Fleet is descending quickly and in full force.
- scene_number: "50"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene50.jpg
  narration: Henry Morgan has taken the first city of the war, however, with the capture
    of Gonzales. The nuclear missile is moved out of Albany, seeing the threat to
    its existence in that city.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene51.jpg

    with Wairau. Unfortunately, their empire is already broken.
- scene_number: "52"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene52.jpg
  narration: Pedro (Brazil) is unable to recapture any of his cities, and takes out
    his anger by declaring war on poor innocent Champa.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene53.jpg
  narration: Sparta pulls a surprise cockblock on Ethiopia by capturing not only Olympia
    but also Bilbais. If Carthage is unable to flip the latter city, Ethiopia‘s hopes
    of conquering more of North Africa could be dashed.
- scene_number: "54"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene54.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka finally makes more progress against the ever-resilient Mughals,
    taking Fatehpur Sikri. The never-great Mughal Empire is made even less great.
- scene_number: "55"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene55.jpg
  narration: Gonzales flips back to the Inuit, but of greater interest, Henry Morgan…
    liberates America??? Yes, good ol‘ Abe Lincoln is back in action in Albany after
    the good-natured Buccaneers decided the world could still use a bit of his wisdom
    and virtue. This is certainly a first for the Battle Royale.
- scene_number: "56"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene56.jpg
  narration: The Boers complete the first Future Worlds wonder, the Enrichment Center.
    I have no idea what it does, so I can only assume it trains test subjects in the
    use of portal-based weaponry. The rest of the world better act fast before Paul
    Kruger releases his deadly neurotoxins.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene57.jpg
  narration: Well shit, I was right-- it was from Portal. Maybe I should‘ve looked
    at the next slide before writing up the previous one. Anyway, 1 science per citizen
    in the city it was built is probably not going to make much of a difference to
    the Boers, with their already ridiculous science output.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene58.jpg
  narration: Parihaka falls for what may be the last time, and Ruapekapeka is on the
    verge of doing the same. However, where has the Maori capital been moved to? It
    doesn‘t seem to be any of the cities visible in this slide.
- scene_number: "59"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene59.jpg
  narration: Another civ with no capacity to attack Champa attacks Champa. Of more
    interest is Sibir completing the Manhattan Project, which seems a bit belated
    given their superpower position and alleged technological advancement.
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: Image 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene60.jpg
  narration: Speaking of Sibir, their war against Yakutia is turning into a grinding
    stalemate, with neither side able to get past the mountain range, and with Mongolia
    (now equipped with artillery!) blocking the main obvious route through.
- scene_number: "61"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene61.jpg
  narration: The Maori enter the information era, but something tells me they won‘t
    be getting much farther than that. Perhaps that 'something' is the fact that they
    are probably going to lose all of their cities except Uxmal and Laredo.
- scene_number: "62"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene62.jpg
  narration: Sweden is next in line to complete the Manhattan Project, representing
    an ever-growing portion of the world with nuclear capabilities. Also, Sweden‘s
    core looks really nice for some reason.
- scene_number: "63"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part45-scene63.jpg
  narration: Some poor Buccaneer scouts are cornered in the Philippine Sea and brutally
    slaughtered by Inuit ships. This may be the first of many war crimes to take place
    between the two nations.

  narration: The Buccs take Gonzales and Dallas, but the cities are sure to flip for
    eternity. Texas, never having made peace with America, works on trying to put
    Lincoln back in the grave that he rose from.

  narration: Vietnam has not one, not two, but three atomic bombs in Bagan. Where
    are they pointing? Only time will tell.

  narration: With numerous great artists furiously painting the battles as they unfold,
    Mexico marches towards A‘aninin. The Blackfoot navy is looking like it could be
    problematic, however.

  narration: The Inuit forces are beginning to lose ground in Kamchatka, perhaps due
    to their new war with the Buccs and perhaps in part because of that fat stack
    of bombers that Yakutia‘s got going on there.

  narration: Both Amga and Beryozovo are under serious fire, yet neither civ is able
    to reach the other‘s city. Mongolia really needs to pick a side here if anything‘s
    going to happen.

  narration: And so begins what may be a long string of flipping with Dallas and Gonzales.
    How long can the two sides keep it up? It will take a serious breakthrough (*ahemnuclearmissilesahem*)
    for either civ to get beyond the current front.

  narration: 'And with that, we go on to the infoaddict slides. The Boers still reign
    king in population, and Morocco still peeks over the bottom of the list as the
    wild card #13.'

  narration: 'The Maori have dropped precipitously to #30 in population, from once
    being the most populous civ in the world. This may be attributed to the fact that
    they lost almost all of their cities.'

  narration: 'Australia gets even bigger with the annexation of New Zealand. Oddly
    enough, Sri Lanka is #12, above Finland. I‘m guessing that the game counts water
    as land, and Sri Lanka certainly has a lot of water.'

  narration: The Boers remain one tech ahead of the Inuit, but that‘s a gap that can
    be easily closed. The Maori still have three more techs than Australia, but they‘re
    undoubtedly going to get surpassed and kicked off the list within the next part
    or two. Otherwise, there are no surprises here.

  narration: Australia now has 11 more cities than the nearest competitor, boosted
    by their latest conquests. When will the Wobbegong be stopped?

  narration: The United States crawls from the depths to put themselves back on the
    list, with a solid 1 city. At least Lincoln‘s not alone in his city-state status.

  narration: Catholicism has almost overtaken Judaism in terms of follower count as
    well as city count. Islam still holds on to dear life.

  narration: Finally, our religion map shows an ever-increasingly small amount of
    places remain atheistic, primarily the pacific islands. The Mughal Empire, at
    the meeting point of three religions, can‘t decide which one to choose.
