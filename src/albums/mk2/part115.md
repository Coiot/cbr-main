  narration: |-
    Hello, everyone! Welcome to Part 115 of the wonderful Civ Battle Royale! This is /u/cardboardmech, also called just Cardboard for short, longtime Battle Royale watcher, sometime OC creator, occasional Civ modder, and your narrator for this part. This is my first time narrating a CBR part and I‘m quite excited.
    This is Graph of Land Area Per Turn by /u/wburrow, and it shows the rise and fall of contenders over the course of the Battle Royale. The rise of Brazil at the end is pretty cool.

  narration: 'And surprising nobody who‘s seen the current state of the cylinder,
    Brazil takes the top spot in the Power Rankings. Pedro now has the longest #1
    streak on top, and it probably won‘t end.'

  narration: Here‘s the beautiful Tile-Accurate Map from /u/DerErlenkonig. We see
    the swathes of unbroken lime green covering two continents and large parts of
    three others.

  narration: This is personally my favorite map, the Tile-Accurateish map form /u/SphericalMelon.
    It just looks so pretty, and gives plenty of information too. We haven‘t seen
    Africa in a long time, so we don‘t know much about the current state of that area.

  narration: Our first shot shows three civs making peace with Pedro and instantly
    being forced back into it, because Total War. A capital somewhere in the cylinder
    falls. Tuninuq comes under assault, though it will probably take some time to
    fall. The Inuit have some planes on this front, while Brazil does not.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: 6
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene06.jpg
  narration: The northern Inuit homeland looks relatively full, but the Brazilians
    are slowly coming north, as the Carnaval begins to melt the snow.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: 7
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene07.jpg
  narration: Interestingly, Ekeuhnick has moved his capital to Nattfaravik, a city
    Iceland founded. Under siege by its former owners, the difficult terrain will
    keep it from falling for now. More Brazilians head north.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene08.jpg
  narration: Ingolfur starts moving the Icelandic carrier fleet around Greenland,
    to try and protect it from Brazil. Only one carrier of thirty-three present on
    the slide has an air unit. Even in Total War, Big Carrier retains its tight grip.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene09.jpg
  narration: Iceland flips Limerick back, but they‘re taking too many losses. No city
    on this slide is at full health now. Iceland itself is visible at the very top.
    All of this will be just Pedro‘s soon. Just Pedro.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene10.jpg
  narration: The Green Line between Sweden and Sibir is now quite wide, though there
    hasn‘t been much movement on this front. Kuchum Khan has rushed more units to
    the battlefield, and Gorky, Dijon, Akrofuom, Kuovola, and Joensuu could fall,
    though they would probably flip back.
- scene_number: "11"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene11.jpg
  narration: The Swedish government has relocated to the eastern Linkoping, while
    the northern Jyvaskyla falls to Brazil. (It‘s pronounced Yuh-vas-ku-lah) In our
    world, Jyvaskyla was home to Lauri Pihkala, the inventor of pesäpallo, or Finnish
    baseball. Sweden seems to be beginning to run low on units, but Gustavus will
    probably hold on for some more time.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene12.jpg
  narration: Yes, Stockholm has fallen. The brave Swedish defenders fought hard, but
    even the father of modern warfare cannot stop the Carnaval. Trondheim also falls.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene13.jpg
  narration: Attila‘s Court, Sintra, and Tus are back in Pedro‘s hands. What‘s alarming
    for Sibir here is that there are almost no Siberian units between the Aral Sea
    and Qashliq. Kuchum needs to reinforce this gap in his lines quickly, or risk
    losing his capital. His core looks dangerously empty now too.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene14.jpg
  narration: Sibir tries a push towards Nyingchi and Phu Xuan. Hovd is annexed. The
    site of a bloody meatgrinder in years past, Kuchum Khan can only hope he can keep
    it at that.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene15.jpg
  narration: The Burmese front. One of the more static ones, Brazil has slowly started
    to push units forward. Lhasa could fall, though the strong Vietnamese air force
    here might slow them down.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene16.jpg
  narration: Pedro takes Denpasar, bringing the outer Indonesian islands under Brazilian
    control. Vietnam takes back My Son with a rare naval melee unit. XCOMs land on
    Sumatra and Borneo, hoping to grab some more cities. Amaravati looks likely to
    fall. My Son might be Brazilian too next turn.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene17.jpg
  narration: Pedro takes Whangarei and looks to hold it. Australia takes back Orange,
    and Surabaya‘s at low health. Amusingly, Krakatoa is actually Australian. I don‘t
    see much of the Australian military here, with only a handful of ships present.
    Where is the Wobbegong?
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene18.jpg
  narration: Looma. The last holdout of the Boers. An XCOM squad and a hovertank guard
    Kruger‘s last city, all that remains of the great Boer military. His robotic body
    seriously damaged in the fall of Africa, he looks out the window. His digital
    eye sees nothing beyond the ice and sea. No one is coming for him today. Snow
    begins to fall on the Antarctic city. Imagine what it is like in Looma.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene19.jpg
  narration: Brazilian soldiers, reinforced with robotic infantry, move to secure
    northern China. Sibir is annexing cities to the north. The cheeky city of Hue
    dares Pedro to take it. A long time ago, this was the abode of Mao. Now China
    is but a memory, and Pedro could soon be the master of this land. Just Pedro.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene20.jpg
  narration: Not much change here, with the borders staying for now. Zhigansk looks
    to fall, but to who? Most units in the area are Siberian, but there‘s a Brazilian
    XCOM in range, and a couple of Korean units within two turns. The Brazilian exclave
    of Ambarchik looks safe for now, until Siberians or Koreans get closer. I‘m going
    to spare Dawkinzz and not mention that Korean city by name.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene21.jpg
  narration: 'Seoul is in the red, with Brazilians half-surrounding it. Unless Sejong
    can pull off a miracle, his capital, once one of the most advanced cities in the
    world, will fall. Of note: every Brazilian city on this slide except for Busan
    is in the red. Fortunately for Pedro, no one has a melee unit in range of his
    cities.'
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene22.jpg
  narration: Here we see Vietnam hold Vigan (pronounced like 'vegan' for Dawkinzz‘s
    benefit) against a trickle of Brazilians.If Pedro manages to get more units in,
    it‘ll fall. Hoi An remains Brazilian until the Trungs can get a Biotrooper in.
    Hanoi is in the yellow from the Brazilwood Bombers, making sure that the citizens
    know that Pedro is coming.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene23.jpg
  narration: Korea tries attacking Mililani, and has embarked units on the way. The
    lack of any Aussie miltary presence in the region could mean that Sejong could
    take it. There is a Brazilian advanced destroyer in the area, however...
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene24.jpg
  narration: Wotjulum is taken by a Brazilian XCOM, asthe Inuit and Korea try to take
    back the former Blackfoot island on the Aleutians.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene25.jpg
  narration: Pedro seems to have started annexing cities in southern Mexico. Not much
    yet in terms of a Brazilian carpet here, but there could be one soon. The area
    seems to have recovered quickly from the war too. It seems so long ago.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene26.jpg
  narration: Not a single annexed city in sight. Brazil does have a significant air
    force here, probably moving up to or supporting the campaign in the north. The
    Great Plains are mostly empty of military units, though there are a lot up on
    the front. Pedro may have problems reinforcing if he doesn‘t get enough units
    here.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene27.jpg
  narration: A new turn comes, and with it, a stack of peace treaties rendered void
    by the will of Nebuchadnezzar.  Brazilians approach Inuvik and Sirmilik, the latter
    looking like it will fall next turn. The Ice Sheet Fleet seems to be mostly made
    up of cybersubs, with an occasional carrier and arsenal ship. I count a total
    of one melee ship. That fleet won‘t be flipping many cities without those embarked
    units.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene28.jpg
  narration: St. Catharines falls to Brazil, who seems to be running low on frontline
    units. In the corner, Nattfaravik seems to be holding out well. The Inuit have
    a lot of land melee units, and could hold the Brazilians for some time.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene29.jpg
  narration: Brazil takes back Limerick, and captures Cork for good measure. Grindavik
    is in the black and looks to turn green next turn. Once more the Emerald Isle
    will be green. The Icelandic defense seems to be centered around Waterford, while
    Iceland itself seems empty. Reykjavik is still damaged.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene30.jpg
  narration: Welp. Jonkoping is gone, most likely razed by Brazil last turn. The Brazilians
    still hold Stockholm, and approach Vasteras and Gdansk, even over the heroics
    of the Swedish Air Force. Every Swedish city is filled to the brim with aircraft,
    as well as the carriers. Except Turku, which only has 5.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene31.jpg
  narration: Sibir takes Akrofuom, but there is a large Brazilian concentration around
    Kouvola. Interestingly enough, Akrofuom is an Ashanti city name. I‘ll quote the
    entire Wikipedia article about it. 'Akrofuom is a town in the Ashanti Region of
    Ghana. The town is known for the Akrofuom Secondary Technical School. The school
    is a second cycle institution.'
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene32.jpg
  narration: Brazil pushes toward Qashliq, as Mini-Pedro decides that the capital
    must be the primary target. Clever little AI. Kuchum Khan rushes units to Shahrisabz
    as the Brazilians approach the city. Sligeach and Bakihon look to be holding,
    as reinforcements arrive via Beaumont.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene33.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian Raj. One of the jewels of the empire , it is largely annexed,
    with the new cities of Uberlandia and Feira de Santana built as symbols of Brazilian
    power. The north and east are taking damage from bombs, but are secured by ground
    troops.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene34.jpg
  narration: Brazil trades Jakarta for My Son and Surabaya. Jakarta will fall back
    to Pedro next turn, however.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene35.jpg
  narration: We see mainland Australia again. Some cities are taking bombs, but there
    is a significant amount of modern ground units, though not quite a full carpet.
    A Boer cybersub sails west of Kadjina, attempting to reestablish contact with
    Skynet. It is safe for the time being, since the Wobbegong is nowhere to be found.
    The submarine tries again, but Kruger no longer controls Skynet. Pedro does. Just
    Pedro.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene36.jpg
  narration: We see the southern Philippines for the first time this part. Manila
    is Vietnamese, Olongapo (o-LONG-ga-PO) is Brazilian, and other cities take damage,
    including Davao, my hometown. I think I can see my house from here! It‘s probably
    been bombed though. Brazil does seem to be attempting to turn Vietnam into an
    enclave, cutting them off from Sibir, and now Australia.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene37.jpg
  narration: Sejong amazingly still holds his capital. Kyoto somehow is at full health,
    and several Brazilian cities are undefended. Henry Parkes has kept Gladstone Australian
    for now. The Koreans have been doing a great job defending, and haven‘t collapsed
    yet.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene38.jpg
  narration: Only a Vietnamese exclave borders Sibir now. Pedro has done a very good
    job in his gutsy attempt to cut Vietnam off from every other empire. Brazilian
    units now hold the mountain passes, and a long string of cities all the way to
    Jeonju.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian snipe of Wotjulum is bombarded by Korea, whose nearest
    melee units are some distance away. Sejong seems to also be bombarding the Inuit
    cities to the north.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene40.jpg
  narration: The Aleutian island cities seem to be safe, due to there not being any
    enemy units in the area. The Koreans have a naval presence, but all the Inuit
    have are small garrisons and some planes. Or are they nukes?
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene41.jpg
  narration: Tuninuq has been captured by Brazil. Inuit units rush south to recapture
    it, as Pedro presses toward Mitimatilik. Ekeuhnick is running low on melee units
    here, and the entire Alaskan theatre could be at risk.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene42.jpg
  narration: The Wobbegong finally appears off Hawaii. No Brazilian units in sight,
    all away on other fronts. The only melee units Parkes has here are land units
    however.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene43.jpg
  narration: Coff‘s Harbour stays Aussie due to a ceasefire, but is in the yellow
    with Brazilian ships still visible nearby.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene44.jpg
  narration: The same AI peace deal keeps Tamworth and Shepparton Australian for now.
    More Brazilian ships are present here, ready to swoop in and take down the cities.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene45.jpg
  narration: Sirmilik is Brazilian now. Pedro‘s units continue marching north, slowly
    but surely. All will become Pedro‘s. Just Pedro.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene46.jpg
  narration: Iceland is pushing towards Nattfaravik with a mix of biotrooopers and
    robot infantry. Oshawa is in the yellow, with a Brazilian paratrooper in the area.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene47.jpg
  narration: Sweden continues to be swamped with Brazilians. Pedro now seems to have
    directed a major push towards Gustavus‘ core. Finland in particular has quite
    a lot of green units.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene48.jpg
  narration: The long Siberian Front stays relatively static for now. Siberian biotroopers
    are continuously headed for the front. Brazil seems to be holding the line here
    for now, with no major offensives coming soon.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene49.jpg
  narration: These mountains look to be the line once more. South of the line is relatively
    safe Brazilian territory, while north of it are the battlegrounds of southern
    Sibir. Pedro‘s offensive on Shahrisabz and Multan seems to be going well, but
    the lack of air support will hurt.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene50.jpg
  narration: Pedro‘s trying to surround Nagchukha with Brazilian units, but the biotroopers
    near it are having none of it. Sibir has air superiority, and Kuchum Khan would
    be well-advised to use that advantage.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene51.jpg
  narration: Every Brazilian city here is in the deep red. Vietnam even has land melee
    units for the job! Hoa Lu could flip back. Senggezangbo is still Vietnamese and
    at full health. It‘s looking like Pedro‘s gathering his forces here.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene52.jpg
  narration: No cities have changed hands since we last saw this area, but some cities
    have lost more health. Australia still holds eastern Borneo, while the Philippines
    is divided between three green civs.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene53.jpg
  narration: The Hue salient still holds, and Brazil seems to be incapable of taking
    more cities without air support. Most Brazilian units are facing north, to the
    sizable Siberian force there.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene54.jpg
  narration: The Inuit take Sendai with a rare advanced destroyer. However, Korea
    is set to take it back next turn, possibly along with Brazilian Wotjulum.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene55.jpg
  narration: Daegu and Tyokhtur fall to Sibir, while Andong is taken by the Brazilians.
    Korea is beginning to collapse on land, and they have no way to retake those cities.
    I miss pre-reboot Korea.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene56.jpg
  narration: The city of Dawkinzz‘s nightmares still holds though, but it‘s under
    Brazilian attack. Brazil might be the one who ends up with the remains of Korea.
    Pedro knew what he was doing, starting a war here. The only one who did. Just
    Pedro.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene57.jpg
  narration: Another turn, another batch of Babylon-vetoed peace deals. The Boers,
    Iceland, and the Inuit try to make peace. I wonder what kind of peace deals those
    would be. Would they give away half their empires? Would they just pay in gold?
    No progress here for now.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene58.jpg
  narration: The Inuit seem to have stopped the green tide for now. Good job Ekeuhnick.
    It might be the planes, it might be the long distance Brazilian reinforcements
    have to travel, it could be the terrain.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene59.jpg
  narration: A similar situation here. the Inuit have held off all attacks and still
    hold Nattfaravik.
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene60.jpg
  narration: Kopavogur, Waterford, and Galway are all in the red and have Brazilian
    units next to them. It‘s very likely they‘ll at least flip next turn. On Iceland
    itself, Reykjavik and Thingvellir are in the yellow. Ingolfur hides in a bunker
    heated by geothermal heat, dreading the time when the Brazilians make landfall.
- scene_number: "61"
  scene_title: 61
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene61.jpg
  narration: Pedro is using Trondheim as a jump-off point for the invasion of the
    Shetlands and Faroes. Southern Norway is beginning to feel the Carnaval. A Brazilian
    carrier somehow finds itself lost on the wrong side of Tonsberg.
- scene_number: "62"
  scene_title: 62
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene62.jpg
  narration: Gdansk falls and Vasteras is in the red. Sweden is now clearly running
    out of units to send to the front, since the front is everywhere now. Brazilian
    embarked units also enter the southern Gulf of Bothnia.
- scene_number: "63"
  scene_title: 63
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene63.jpg
  narration: Not much changes here, except this time Otrar is under serious attack.
    The battle rages on between Nagchukha and Rutog. I like how the Vietnamese exclave
    has a nice little pasture.
- scene_number: "64"
  scene_title: 64
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part115-scene64.jpg
  narration: Rangoon falls, and so does Lahore? Somehow that Vietnamese ship managed
    to sneak in past the embarked units and take the city! That is some daring stuff,
    Trungs. Striking back even as you lose ground. Wonderful.

  narration: Pedro has Jakarta now, but lost Surabaya and My Son. My Son will quickly
    fall back to Pedro and stay Brazilian, since the nearest Vietnamese melee unit
    is in the Straits of Malacca. Henry Parkes of Australia, however, has more melee
    units and planes in the region and will probably hold the line for now. But everything
    here will be Pedro‘s eventually. Just Pedro.

  narration: Parkes has Olongapo now, and has a biotrooper threatening Davao. Manila
    and Caloocan are Brazilian, and the Australian air advantage is clear here. Hanoi
    is still at half health, an d a useful carrier is found near Hoi An, which is
    Vietnamese now.

  narration: A large swath of Brazilian cities greet us north of Caloocan, even with
    a small carpet in the Chongqing area. This could be the site of Pedro‘s next push...
    Vigan is threatened and Korean cybersubs, one with missiles, menaces Brazilian
    Japan.

  narration: Hue, Rach Gia, and Tianjin are all feeling the pressure from the Brazilian
    mini-carpets (Do we call them rugs?) around the key cities of the front. It seems
    Pedro wants to hue in Hue soon. Seoul remains in trouble, but has a fair amount
    of troops for defense.

  narration: 'Dawkinzz‘s Bane falls to Brazil and Zhigansk is Siberian. The Inuit
    defense line moves to Olenyok, but with almost no support behind it. The Inuit
    may just be starting to collapse along this front. Another thing of note: The
    Siberian worker army marches east.'

  narration: |-
    Well this is the last slide for today. Mililani has survived, and Yokohama is Brazilian now, down to 41 population. Last time we saw it, it was at 48 pop and held by Australia. Pedro‘s tourism prevented a greater massacre. More proof the Pedro is a benevolent overlord.
    Well this has been cardboardmech/Cardboard, your narrator for this part. I‘d like to thank BC for giving me this opportunity, as well as everyone on the sub, and the MFLC of course. Hope you have a good day/night, and it was a pleasure to narrate part 115 of the Civ Battle Royale Mark 2.1!
