  narration: "Happy holidays and greetings to you all! This is u/GoatontheMountain,
    coming to you with great humility and enthusiasm for the adventures we have in
    store today. I‘m truly honored for the opportunity to wander the hexagons of this
    silly little cylinder together. \n We open today with a delightful seasonal love
    note from u/Coiot. As requested, this one has been printed and colored by my excitable
    four-year-old daughter. She declared herself a Carthage supporter because Hannibal
    looks funny and it‘s good to throw elephants at bad guys. Truth."

    painstakingly drawn lines shift over the coming ten turns? Only the Norns know

    The Power Rankings aren‘t even out yet, but I think we all know exactly what shade of oranje is featured above these words. It‘ll take quite a turn for that to change by this album‘s end, but hope yet remains in this strange little world!
    Coiot‘s Note: Sometimes the narrations are ready before the PR Slides.

  narration: "We‘ve made it to turn 113 of the MkII.b era, and what a journey awaits
    us! The nascent war for the world‘s tundra begins in earnest as Eheunick (Inuit)
    decides to get creative in his lack of melee ships and sets a squad of biotroopers
    astride a cybersub and sends them forth to make war upon Nattfaravik. Leary of
    the rampant nuking-out-of-existence in other parts of the cylinder Ingolfur (Iceland)
    preps two settlers to back fill the mellifluous Flokadallur. The icy hammer falls
    first, though, on Husavik, a likely target once the garbage patch is laid to watery
    rest. \n    Through it all, listless Canadian remnants float in their northern
    lake home, though they are still more relevant than that non-nuke carrying Inuit
    cybersub outside Edmonton. \n    One final fun note here: if you track from southwest
    to northeast looking at the Brazilian overflow you can see the progression from
    paratroopers only to almost exclusively XCOMs. It‘s like reading the record of
    a landscape through the layers of a canyon. But less peaceful and more shooty."

  narration: |-
    A flood of notifications spin, though we shall never know their contents. Is it still a denouncement if no sentient creature ever hears it, or just a processor bellowing into the digital winds?
        On the battlefield, the Inuit have wisely kept a good stock of civilian units, serving essentially as seat holders for troops they may someday want in this sector. Without those workers there would be none of these omnipresent Future Worlds improvements and 30% more lime green parachutes.
        Eheunick has really gone all in on his future infantry and ranged naval mounts strategy, boarding several more raiding parties down in James Bay. The robots can probably stay hidden, but I have to assume breaching to allow the bio units to breathe will rather diminish a cybersub‘s stealth capabilities.

  narration: "It‘s strangely empty around Selfoss, but Ingolfur may have (accurately!)
    decided it‘s both cheaper and safer to simply wait three turns for Crowfoot (Blackfoot)
    and Pedro (Brazil) to garrison the region, rather than try to protect it himself.
    \n Less efficient is his air force, which does not exist in this slide, despite
    cities and carriers capable of supporting a full 162 bombers. A friend of mine
    in the U.S. Navy (now retired) used to enjoy asking people how may aircraft carriers
    the United States has, just to get a sense of how much (or little) they understand
    about the armed forces. The answer is 10, 19 if you‘re willing to stretch the
    definition a little bit, and there are fewer in our entire world than Iceland
    has in this slide. Funny thing, the actual island of Iceland has long enjoyed
    the title of “unsinkable aircraft carrier” for its role in projecting allied air
    power back in World War II. \n  Finally, how is it possible that Iceland is getting
    more population out their tundra towns than the Inuit? I know they are a lot less
    dense, but it really feels like Eheunick is dropping the ball here."

  narration: "Europe, where strange blonde figures battle over the ancestral homes
    of nations now remembered only in the names that still dot this scarred countryside.
    Once again the bio- and robot infantry of Iceland enjoy a qualitative advantage
    over Sweden‘s organic troops. That strength differential is significantly less
    important here, though, owing to the large swaths of empty space and perpetual
    0 health status of all Iceland‘s cities. Sweden‘s air corps is really earning
    its keep here. Reinforcements will be slow to arrive for either side as Cumae
    is the only non-puppeted city on the entire front. Even so, Cologne and Malmo
    have already fallen. Now the fighting appears to be most intense south of Berlin,
    where soldiers engage in gritty bank-to-bank warfare among the never ending customs
    houses. \n Before we move, let‘s all agree to pin an imaginary medal on Gustavus‘
    (Sweden) chest for all those properly equipped carriers!"

  narration: "To central Asia, where the Vietnamese take inspiration from the dwarfs
    and retreat to their mountain holdfasts. Sad to say, Boer fans, but Kruger seems
    to have swallowed the bait and is totally focused on Peshawar, rather than the
    easier, faster conquests that await across Uttar Pradesh. One Boer biotrooper
    got his orders a touch off and attempts to ride the rail line into Lahore, rather
    than Lahor, a very understandable but strangely human mistake. \n A compatriot
    of his stops on her way to the front line, momentarily stunned to find herself
    standing in that rarest of places, a legend that exists only for the briefest
    of moments, appearing beneath radioactive clouds at the end of a flickering atomic
    rainbow: no man‘s land. The world‘s dictators will gobble up these unclaimed tiles
    within hours, but for now she revels in the freedom. She also sheds a tear for
    all the scenic plantations, farms and vineyards that still exist in this idyllic
    place, knowing the north African worker army will soon relocate here and replace
    them all with modern improvements."

  narration: To the east, Australia is back on the front foot in the northern theater,
    though we‘ve seen this too many times to be conclusive. Australia is unlikely
    to produce enough units to sustain a push from Rach Gia and Bien Hoa alone, though
    the new air support up north will certainly help!

  narration: "Up to nine more nukes are more waiting to leave Western Australia even
    more empty than it is in our own world. Aussie workers stand ready to scrub the
    land as fast as the fallout can fall down. For all their might there is a total
    of one Australian ship in this entire slide, and even she‘s staring down imminent
    explosive decompression. \n Through it all, do the spectating Kimberly laugh or
    weep as their ancient homes are put to the nuclear torch?"

  narration: Good night, sweet, fractured zealot kingdom. All Tiridates (Armenia)
    ever wanted was to unite the world in the love of someone else‘s religion, and
    then watch some dudes jump out of planes. Kuchum Khan (Sibir), resentful of either
    his empire‘s wholesale conversion or his own fear of heights, vows to snuff out
    the flyin‘ apostles‘ light once and for all, though the smart money is on him
    only getting 66% of the way there. Yerevan should survive to next week‘s centennial
    celebration, but no longer.

  narration: "It‘s far too soon to project a result here, but that quartet of great
    generals west of Tegea will surely exacerbate the yawning chasm in troop quality
    in this war. Sweden needs to adopt more modern infantry, fast. Better troops from
    the south have already cost them Messene. There also seem to be a lot more Giant
    Death Robots around lately, particularly in Iceland (though even the Blackfoot
    are experimenting with them now). \n I‘m also quite curious about that very well-armed
    Boer fleet hanging out just outside Sibir in the Black Sea—how did they get there,
    and why?"
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part99-scene13.jpg
  narration: "Goolarabooloo? More like GoolaraBOOMloo, no? The Vietnamese fleet is
    fading, but the devastated Millibinyarrin and Windjanan citizenry are still far
    from safe. \n Here‘s a fun game for the cartographically inclined among you: Start
    sketching out a map as we go through these slides and plot out all the boundaries
    of the Brazilian peacekeeping force. It‘s pretty easy to form a great circle style
    boundary around South America and see just how much of the map is being overrun,
    as well as where the peacekeepers of the future are due to land. Pedro (Brazil)
    already has a good half the map under his thumb, though not half the land mass.
    If 5.3 million troops can do that, how many will square that circle and bring
    the entire map under his benevolent, non-combative control? Could Pedro find that
    the world is, in the end, truly not large enough to contain him?"

  narration: As expected, Parkes (Australia) takes Tianjian, but at the cost of all
    the melee forces involved. I‘d say it will impossible to hold for long, but Vietnam
    looks barer than we‘ve ever seen, with only two units north of Than Hoa.

  narration: "Long ago, Tibet refused to found a religion. Forgotten in the centuries
    since then is that this leaves one slot open, and now the moment has arrived!
    \n Inspired by the sight of sexy vacationing Brazilians, the people of Reykjavik
    turn from their carrier worship to an earthy, sensual form of Heathenism. As Ragnarok
    approaches from the west with the Night‘s King, they turn their eyes beyond Midgard
    and ponder what wyrd the Norns will spin, then raise a bowl of mead to the gods,
    Odin, Thor and ReonMonterus. \n For those of you who flummoxed by the Forn Siðr
    label, take heart—I‘m a theologian by training and even I had never come across
    this particular sect before. In fact, there are already VASTLY more adherents
    on the cylinder than there are on our globe. Wikipedia is here, fortunately, and
    ready to help us with the fun image of a faith based off entering a “shamanic
    trance ritual complex,” following the World Tree to Hel, then reporting back on
    what one has seen to the waiting congregation. \n Also: I can only assume Ingolfur
    refuses to move anyone to protect the Shetlands solely so he can one day make
    an “Oh my Odin, they killed Kilkenny! You bastards!!” joke."

  narration: "Checking in on our new beliefs here, we see +2 culture, a waste, and
    +10% growth, a reasonable enough bonus though significantly less so at this stage
    of the game. It is interesting to see Fertility Rites go to a religion whose leadership
    is comprised almost exclusively of women and gay men (again, per Wikipedia). I
    say this not as any kind of value judgment, but purely out of practical curiosity
    for the mechanics here. \n Incidentally, do you think Lutheranism‘s Charitable
    Missions could let them bribe the Afghan peacekeepers out of the way to finally
    unite Arabia? It certainly couldn‘t hurt to try!"
- scene_number: "17"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part99-scene17.jpg
  narration: "Arianism is still clearly the best of all religions (production, science,
    industrial units and a bunch of culture) but Monasteries and Jesuit Education
    (stolen out from under the Catholics‘ nose!) are solid for Dodekatheism. Forn
    Siðr adds some gold to finish paving the North Atlantic. \n One must wonder whether
    the Australian-Boer coalition against Vietnam is actually a religiously-motivated
    crusade. If so, the Trungs (Vietnam) and their Theravadra Buddhist cohorts must
    have offended the primacy of Christ, for the Blackfoot Arians have felt no compulsion
    to join their Catholic and Lutheran cousins in battle."

  narration: "Helpfully highlighted here, Sejong (Korea) will show Trigger (Darkhan,
    of Yakutia) mercy, leaving his descendants to ride out Ragnarok beneath the Arctic
    ice. Now the Korean despot just needs to push that Mongol advanced destroyer out
    of the way to stake his claim to longest aquatic road. \n Meanwhile, aboard the
    orphaned Yakut sub, years pass. The residents mingle, fall in love, marry and
    procreate, grow old and leave the sub to the next generation and the next and
    the next. Boredom overwhelms, and the descendants of the great leader finally
    dream up a simulated spheroid where doomed and fictitious civilizations dance
    and slaughter for the sub‘s delight. After years of careful effort, desperate
    bugfixes, and frighteningly intense devotion, the Boers win."

  narration: "Aussie flotsam swirls around Kaneohe, where Kamehameha (Hawai‘i) enters
    the information era, meaning they‘ve finally discovered robots, lasers or cell
    phones. \n Personally, I believe the Hawai‘ians continued survival to be the result
    of a loophole, a dropped bureaucratic stitch somewhere in the Australian government.
    The Aloha warriors certainly aren‘t complaining. They celebrate with a pair of
    great musicians who will surely soothe the world with their dulcet ukulele ballads
    in the years to come."

  narration: "Despite their dire straits, Armenia still has a nearly full carpet!
    Unfortunately, it‘s about the size (and effectiveness) of a welcome mat, but at
    least Kuchum will have something to wipe his feet on as he moves toward the ancient
    capital. \n Yerevan and Bukhara are both on borrowed time. Bukhara may look safe,
    but that backdoor squad out of Carrollton will show no mercy. Even so, bold ‘troopers
    have drifted over the mountains to sack citadels outside Tashkent and Merv, tearing
    down the ancient fortresses in a suicidal declaration of resistance to the hordes
    of robots and mech artillery funneling south."

  narration: "Cumae has been demilitarized, cities swap (Malmo, Messene and Hamburg,
    all to Sweden) and the war for Europe shifts north. \n Pedro cares not. Whether
    the Lion or Rune flies over these provincial capitals, the bright green brigade
    will rule the streets and hills."
- scene_number: "22"

  narration: Mech artillery, which look an awful like they ought to be melee-capable
    spider tanks, sadly are not and can not, meaning Hafnarfjordur is safe. There
    is certainly movement on this front, but so far it‘s all just noisy bombing runs
    and the fleets still feeling one another out.

  narration: Forn Siðr reforms, with the theological equivalent of Goddess of Protection.
    Is that really a great call? I mean, who could stand to benefit from Arianism‘s
    +1% production bonus per follower more than the spread out island empire facing
    down potent enemies on both sides? Pride will be the death of you, Ingolfur!

  narration: "If you knew it was likely your last night on the cylinder, what would
    you produce? One last unit  for a kamikaze charge? Wealth, to take with you into
    exile? A sub, with which to escape the city? Tiridates chooses a nuclear plant,
    leaving a clean, lasting energy source for Kuchum as a housewarming gift to fuel
    his next conquest. \n Meanwhile, the remaining Yerevanis write, paint and compose
    their final opuses, and lament the nearly-born great musician who will now likely
    never take up his synth axe drumitar to tour the future world."

  narration: Across the battlefield Tyumen holds up a dark mirror to Armenia‘s idealism.
    While one ageless lord accepts defeat with grace the other knows only hellfire.
    Here, too, the sculptors form and the musicians play in their respective guild
    halls, but in Sibir the uranium will not slowly fuel a city but rather fall and
    flash, in a heartbeat, to burn one out.

  narration: "34. 34 potential nukes, unguarded but for a few fighter wings and scattershot
    cybersubs, drift toward the tired western Australian provinces. There is no formation
    here, no grand plan, just endless drifting hulks. Crewed by the walking dead,
    swirled by an uncaring current towards unwitting targets, through the fog of war
    they come. \n The Kimberly see, and step aside. They could easily form a neutral
    unit chain south to the ice and keep peace for their ancestral home, but race
    memories of dead-eyed diggers linger, etched anew in each successive generation
    through grade school textbooks and chilling bedtime tales, and so they simply
    watch the dread raft fleet pass."

  narration: Hamburg goes back to Iceland, but the Swedes now hold unchallenged sway
    over the North Sea, while no one can claim a firm hold on northern Europe. That
    may change soon, though, as the Lion finally splices together his first biotroopers.
    Gustavus already fields as many as Ingolfur commands bio and robot divisions combined!
    I‘m not generally a betting woman, but I‘ll throw down a sawbuck on the Swedes
    to come out ahead here, barring a repeat of Sibir‘s intervention last go around.

  narration: |-
    Did someone fiddle with the AI during the reboot? Suddenly everyone (Iceland excluded) is loading their carriers up for war. Sadly, all those nukes would be for naught in the event of a war with the Walkers, owing to neutral units protecting most every blue and white city center. If they targeted the Blackfoot, however…
     Truly, all we want for the new year is one war where neutral, unrelated third party units don‘t significantly change the outcome. At least those rapidly replicating GDRs should work as intended, smashing through the 300 meter tall wall of ice meant to hold the wildling buccaneer horde of Petit-Goave safely and forever in their swampland home.

  narration: "Open mouth, insert foot, and kiss that tenner goodbye. Iceland conjure
    up yet another army from thin air while Gustavus forms a defensive line from Wroclaw
    to Poznan, apparently equally afraid of the Khan at his back as the rampaging
    viking king. His negligence costs him Messene and Berlin, and all he can do in
    retaliation is settle Þingvellir (Thingvellir, I believe) near to the front. \n
    Berlin and Hamburg are still in play, but that force out of Cumae could swarm
    Tegea and be on Ohrid in a heartbeat."

  narration: "Panning south, Iceland has nine cities in the black. What‘s worse, poor
    Elis has been totally nuked off the map, a small crater all that remains of a
    once vibrant (I presume) city. \n Meanwhile, if Tiridates were to declare on the
    heathens and bring all those paratroopers to bear, he could at least go out in
    a blaze of glory for a turn or two (and greatly improve his inevitable greatest
    extent map!). \n But for now the Armenian army holds out hope, a Boered navy floats
    on, Iceland turns the Mediterranean into a massive (and massively depressing)
    empty dance floor, and a lone chimera scurries over the rolling hills where lie
    the bones of long dead legionnaires. \n Side note: Had the legendary Polish scout
    known the pass he once boldly held contained beneath his feet the glowing power
    to wipe whole cities from the map, perhaps he would have despaired at war‘s inevitability
    and simply let the Spartans pass. How the world might look now if Leonidas had
    succeeded in those early days…"

  narration: "Oh glorious dawn! Only the hardest-hearted Sibirian (or exhausted power
    ranker) could fail to smile as the flat grey horde are repulsed by the warmer
    colors, gentler hearts and simpler units to their south. Bukhara has flipped but
    not not fallen. Is it the mountains or simply a lack of will that stay Sibir‘s
    heavy boots from finishing this conquest? \n Worth noting: Kruger has now annexed
    five of his eight cities on this slide. Whether for speeding up the Vietnam invasion
    or preparing for an inevitable attempt to break through the Sibir meatgrinder
    that once doomed the Trungs, either way this is a good sign for cyboergs and a
    worrisome one for the rest of the world."

  narration: This corner of the Indian Ocean, and the soft Trung underbelly, are safe
    and whole once more. Well, except for the nukes. And the near-constant aerial
    bombardment. And the Korean tourists, loudly decrying these warlike people who
    can‘t just appreciate science for its own sake but instead must use it for something
    so gauche as war.

  narration: "Bukhara falls again, and it shan‘t flip back. With one leg of its tripartite
    base cut out the Armenian empire sways perilously. \n The Boers and Swedes care
    not, too focused on rushing to their own wars to appreciate the tragedy before
    them—the birth of a rump state. \n To the northwest, Sibir proves once more that
    noone recarpets like the Double K. Wow. Kruger ought not to turn his back if he
    wishes to keep his latest spoils."

  narration: |-
    The Tegea offensive quickly peters out for Ingolfur and the Swedes will retake it immediately. The Viking reforms his army in the Low Countries, eager to harrow the retaken Berlin and defend the latest flashpoint at Hamburg. Meanwhile, the Swedes seem more eager to pounce on the aforementioned Tegea and the once safe Munich!
     It‘s amazing how much this conflict shifts, with hot spots moving north to south, the lines bulging and bowing east to west. While lasting progress has been scarce, this may be the most dynamic, competitive and compelling theater across the combined history of the CBRs, the exact opposite of the Vietnam/Sibir stalemate of a thousand years or the many rapid steamrolls we‘ve seen.

  narration: "Back in Northern Brazil, a pair of embarked biotroopers circumvent the
    green sea via a more traditionally blue one and look to emulate their worker brethren,
    who have apparently conquered St. Louis despite being civilians. Let‘s call it
    a workers‘ revolution. The seaborne infantry will look to make landfall around
    Hafnarfjordur, and possibly Husavik beyond. Iceland will soon be off the continent
    and back in the watery wastelands where they belong. \n Also worth noting: given
    the small, concentrated air force supporting the Inuit conquest of the Maritimes,
    a wise viking might see whether he or she could sneak a nuke or two in on Medicine
    Hat."

  narration: "Obligatory naval stat shaming time! Iceland has built 183 naval units
    in this slide, of which two are melee capable. 108 are aircraft carriers, six
    of which combine to support a grand sum of 12 units, while 102 host roller skating
    parties for middle schools and drunk millennial birthday parties. Most distressing
    is the one empty carrier who seems to have caught a virus that has drained it
    to a sliver of health. If only it were contagious, we might see a meaningful reduction
    in turn processing times and a new, more potent Icelandic navy born from the wreckage.
    \n Aside from the two advanced destroyers present, there are actually two other
    conquer-capable units present here. The first, a squad of paratroopers marooned
    in a foreign land, but the second is a lost privateer from the before times. The
    doomed ship creaks with age in an endless grey sea, stuck fast in a traffic jam
    that has lasted a thousand years and will last ten thousand more. Generation after
    generation of sailors has been born and raised on stories from simpler times,
    stories about when this waterlogged hulk was sleek and new, the pride of the seven
    seas, and of the seas themselves, open seas, where a ship might chart its own
    course from port to port. The stories are moving, but the privateer is not, and
    tonight they pass another watch staring up at the narrow spray of stars between
    the canyon walls of nuclear powered behemoths, and only in their dreams are they
    free."

    the relentless advance of the Brazilians, now dangerously close to the front and
    threatening to gum up the whole works.

    of these cool retro power armor infantry kicking around, with another set up in

    Gaza is defended only by merchants, traders, builders and a lone Mamikonian. I
    fear the Kimberly will never get their desert conquest…\n The fledgling Boer cities
    of Ghapan and Tosontsengel, those sweet summer‘s settlements who‘ve never seen

    swap, (unlikely, but totally plausible), spinning this war‘s long east-west front
    a full 90°, with a northern Sweden battling a purely southern Iceland. This war
    is a treasure. \n Sweden‘s army is growing impressively. They have more than enough
    in Germany to hold the line in the west and a massive reserve force around Wroclaw
