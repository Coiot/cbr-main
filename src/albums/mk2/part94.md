  narration: Howdy ya’ll, Lordfowl here, and boy this episode will be one exciting
    ride! Here we have a class A meme from /u/AlbinosRideDinos that explains in simple
    terms what Vietnam’s real problem was last part.

  narration: Here we have the tile accurate map, and one just must appreciate those
    beautiful European Borders, great job Iceland and Sweden making the map look pretty.
    Please avert your eyes from the Middle east where the continues Boer Oranje is
    broken by some disgusting exclaves.

  narration: Here we see the Melon Map which helpfully highlights the puppeted lands
    of our Favorite conquerors. Note that Sibir has almost no puppets, while almost
    all of the Boer middle east is!

  narration: As long as the boers continue to not lose cities, they will continue
    to be number one.  That .74 deviation surprises me, I would assume the Power Rankers
    a monolith on this one.

  narration: A shot of the land down under reveals that Vietnam really should be worried,
    at first glance an impressive display of force by the Australians. A closer look,
    however, reveals quite a few interesting things about Parks’ army. Firstly Australia,
    in this shot alone has 30 unused carriers (one of them in an inland lake!?!) ,
    perhaps an infection of carrieritis was among Morgan’s parting gifts? In the former
    Kimberly lands, the worker army is ready to be turned into Diggers, and to be
    sent to the Vietnamese Front. Finally, Australia has created two settlers in this
    slide (one by Marseille, one by Canberra), perhaps they are going to see if they
    can rush and steal some land from a city destroyed in the Asian Nuclear Apocalypse?

  narration: A digger takes Hoi An and extends Australian contol down the coast of
    Vietnam, Korea has joined their brothers in a darker shade of green.  As Hearts
    of Iron player this seems eerily familiar, Manchuko anyone? Meanwhile, Than Hoa
    and Dong Hoi continue to lose health, and Vijaya is in the deep red, but if Australia
    wants to advance anywhere in the south they will have to worry more about annoying
    peacekeepers than Vietnamese Resistance, which even in the north is meager at
    best. A city in the top left corner is definitely named Can Tho. Sorry Trungs
    I’d have to respectfully disagree.

  narration: The Vietnamese bombing campaign could very well soon be backed up by
    a Kamikaze nuclear attack, but in the long run this attack won‘t save their dying
    empire. Boer troops continue to advance on Kabul, soon to add the ancient communist
    capital to their conquest.  Susa is suffering from an attempted counter-attack,
    and the Viets are shoring up their defenses around around the Hindu Kush, but
    seeing the collapse of their Eastern Front and  taking into account the Boer track
    record of smashing through seemingly impenetrable lines,  India had better hope
    that Kruger peaces out soon or their green will be replaced with the Oranje of
    the Rijik.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene08.jpg
  narration: The war in Europe continues as well, with Neapolis falling to the Svea
    Rike. Both sides seem to be replenishing for another round and neither side is
    weak here but neither boasts a full carpet.  Also notice some spillover of foreign
    peacekeepers from nations who may eventually become a problem to the European
    Powers. Interestingly, Iceland has four settlers in this slide. Maybe they want
    to level Sweden and build Icelandic cities on the ashes? After the North Sea Nuclear
    Exchange last part who can blame them?

  narration: "“Our enemies call it ‘the garbage patch’, well, one man’s trash is another
    man’s treasure!” - Winston Churchill, Navy representative at the Council of Prime
    Ministers.  (39 useless carriers here!). Meanwhile, our spy in the Kimberley empire
    discovers that news travels exceedingly slowly in the Indonesian archipelago,
    and Jamamada has yet to hear of Texas’ Fate."
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene10.jpg
  narration: Here we see the devastating Battle of Borneo, the air war that has taken
    cities on both sides of the strait of Malacca deep into the red, but with Kimberly
    in the way it is unlikely the Viets or Aussies will be able get the troops necessary
    for a flip through to the other side. Nebby has also kindly highlighted a Finnish
    cargo ship seemingly unaffected by the Great War,  passing through Vietnamese
    territory to reach Australia. Lucky for him, the Trungs have yet to launch unrestricted
    submarine warfare against the aussies and safe passage of merchant ships is assured.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene11.jpg
  narration: Hoi An and all of Korea fall back to the Twins, for now, but the Manchurian
    city of Tran Hoa is taken by the Australian imperialists.  Next, the encircled
    city of Hai Phong seems sure to fall, as the ‘Roos have magicked up a decent force
    to reverse Vietnam’s half hearted counterattack. Additionally it seems Vietnam
    has Air supremacy, as every mainland aussie city is in the black, and none of
    the Vietnamese are.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene12.jpg
  narration: Kabul falls to Kruger, and the Boers now own the mountain passes into
    the seemingly abandoned Indian heartland. Agara holds the Statue of Liberty, and
    I expect it’s torch to be changed to a Boer salute a-la Man In the High Castle  within
    three parts. To the north we see the infinitely stupid Sibir, who peaced out with
    the Trung just when the Tide of the war had turned. Kutchum managed to grab defeat
    from the jaws of victory, and ended up with the same amount of cities he started
    with  just after the hiatus. Back when he was, you know, losing!!!! Come on, you
    have so many troops right there!
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene13.jpg
  narration: Here we see the nominally Finnish city of Hrazdan, shellshocked by first
    the collapse of their empire back home, and then the Boerkreig of Vietnamese Southwestern
    Asia. Now the finns build entertainment centers to just try and get away from
    it all. While stagnant, the city is seemingly not running a deficit in anything,
    content to ease their citizens into their still new status as a third world country.
    A quiet, a peaceful life.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene14.jpg
  narration: I take back everything I said about Kutchum Khan’s stupidity, and instead
    I will laud his high intelligence. After the blitzkrieg of Finland, many advised
    Gustavus to attack Sibir’s exposed western lands, all units being sent to the
    Vietnamese front. Kutchum has apparently taken this advice to heart turning the
    tables on the Swedes while they are locked in battle with Iceland.  This means
    that the Khan is free to move forces to Europe and engage the Swedes in the same
    kind of two front war that destroyed Vietnam.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene15.jpg
  narration: A lone digger has recaptured the once great Hoi An bringing it down to
    a measly 5 population. Vietnam will lose the war quite badly, the question is,
    will they ever be able to recover? A suggestion for the part name was “at the
    gates of saigon”. Vietnam will be lucky if Saigon is its last casualty.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene16.jpg
  narration: "“Hello and welcome aboard the Swedish-Sibir front tour train! Buckle
    up, and we’ll get right into it! Coming up right ahead is the Caucus Theater,
    with total Siberian dominance in the Caspian and Yervashavant already in the red,
    this area seems well within Sibir’s grasp. A bit further down we see that Sibir
    posses and advantage of extreme numerical and technological superiority on the
    Ukrainian Front. Ufa is defended by a single rifleman against Biological Infantry
    and spider tanks. Nedong is completely undefended, but the Siberians are not worried,
    who can Gustavus Adolphus spare to try and take it?”"
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene17.jpg
  narration: "“‘This central front seems devoid of Units!’ you might say, but take
    a second look at the massing of troops around Zibo, within a few turns these troops
    could fall like a hammer on Leningrad. The formerly Finnish lands are just as
    devoid of units as they were several parts ago, and barring a miracle, it seems
    Kekkonen will live to witness his conqueror share his own fate.”"
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene18.jpg
  narration: "“At the end of our little tour we can see the naval forces arrayed by
    both sides, likely leading to a pointless naval battle in the Arctic sea in the
    coming years. Interestingly, the empty carrier fleet by Vladivostok is seemingly
    lead by a Caravel, a relic of an ancient time. The knights of a long dead civ
    look forward to a spectacle for the history books. Perhaps those are the Knights
    of mao himself, laughing insanely at the coming bloodshed.”"
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene19.jpg
  narration: Here we see the western front for the swedes, and although they are attempting
    an attack against Cume the swedes will not make any progress on this front. Neither
    side has the Units to make a large push against an enemy city. Iceland will still
    win in this situation, as they only  need to hold out until the swedes direct
    their resources to attempt to slow Sabir‘s advance.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene20.jpg
  narration: The Captain looked out over his aircraft carrier, the tarmac crushed
    in in places by the constant Swedish bombardment, crews scrambling to service
    the fighters  and bombers under his command. The Captain knew that this was a
    suicide mission, and had made peace with that months ago. His crew would die so
    that Iceland may have a chance to attack Hamburg, and drive the Swedish enemy
    back to their Scandinavian hovels. News of the Sibir attack had yet to reach the
    Captain, and he believed failure in this battle could mean the loss of Icelandic
    Europe. As the massive Ship powered on into the Cybersub infested  waters around
    Hamburg, the muttered a prayer to the  Old Gods, and ordered the attack to commence.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene21.jpg
  narration: Statistics show that Sibir is by no means a superpower, in fact, they
    seem to be a mid-tier nation, 10th in army size, 6th in both crop output and production.
    Perhaps I have misjudged their strength?
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene22.jpg
  narration: Nevermind! Sweden is truly a paper Tiger! Behind Sibir in nearly every
    single category, especially the important ones like Army Size (12 to Sibir’s 10)
    and production output (9th to Sibir’s 6th). Your days are numbered Adolphus.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene23.jpg
  narration: Here we see Korea, a nation that has well and truly missed it’s chance.  Perhaps
    if they had joined the Vietnamese Dogpile, Korea could have made some massive
    gains. I suppose it might not be too late to get something out of it, but Sejong
    must hurry. His plot against Tygyn Darkhan will in all likelihood lead to nothing,
    (see brazil) but perhaps it might get his  warscore high enough for a war with
    Mongolia?  Chances like these don‘t present themselves every day!  Here we also
    see that Australia has many reserves ready to send to the Chinese front. Vietnam
    will be getting no break here…
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene24.jpg
  narration: While it might seem like this is the beginning of a successful Vietnamese  counter
    attack, keep in mind that Persia full of Boer troops, while half the Units in
    Vietnamese India are workers. The Boers will retake all of the mountain cities,
    the question is whether they can push beyond them.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene25.jpg
  narration: The hammer of Sibir falls, Yerashavant flips to the great Khan, and Swedes
    everywhere are heard weeping and gnashing their teeth. Nedong is surrounded, but
    its loss will only be temporary as Ufa is already in the red and preparing to
    surrender to the Grey banner of the Eastern Army.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene26.jpg
  narration: 'Forgies Law: The amount of hype generated by a declaration of war is
    inversely proportional to the war’s actual importance. The Sweden-Iceland war
    was proclaimed to be a war for the fate of Europe, and it has fizzled into a nothing
    stalemate, with neither side having the forces to break the other’s meager defenses.
    In the middle east, the Boers were predicted to never make it past Parsagrade,
    and yet now they march through the Hindu Kush!'
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene27.jpg
  narration: To the north we see more of the same, some half-hearted fighting around
    the Benelux, but France and Germany are all but deserted, and the North Sea is
    devoid of ships. If the Boers peaced out next turn and DoW’ed either Iceland or
    Sweden they would be in serious trouble.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene28.jpg
  narration: Hawaii, perhaps feeling threatened by the Australian garbage patch floating
    past their Island are construction a Submarine. Nearing 40 citizens, Kaneohe is
    striving to reclaim the title of the most populous city in the world. Peace and
    quiet, not in the negative on anything, Hawaii seems like a paradise compared
    to some of the Cylinder‘s other metropolises.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene29.jpg
  narration: Here we see the almost deserted South Vietnam Sea. If the Aussies went
    the way of Sibir to peace out now and surprise attack one of their weaker neighbors
    (looking at you Kimberly, Blackfoot and Korea) they would have made huge gains
    for nearly no loss. The war as it stands looks likely to stall out, a drain on
    Australia’s resources and a chance for the Boers to continue their advance against
    a divided foe.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene30.jpg
  narration: A glimpse of the Inuit held Kamchatka reveals they too could stand to
    gain from a surprise attack against Korea. At this point war  with any one of
    their neighbors is profitable for their the Freezing Forces of Ehe-howeveryousayit.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Boers have reclaimed the Mountain passes and the Vietnamese have
    magicked up a defense for Western India. I fear this front will become another
    Sibir, but hope that this is just a temporary pause. Either way, the Boers have
    made massive gains, and it‘s important to remember the big picture.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene32.jpg
  narration: Nedong will fall next turn, but so will Tashkent, and Ufa the turn after
    that. While other empires seem to be like candles, slowly burning out and losing
    ground, Sweden will be like a firework, expanding massively and losing it all
    within the space of a few parts. Ticonderoga sits open, perhaps the Boers or the
    Finns should join the dogpile?
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene33.jpg
  narration: Battle hardened Sibir troops, veterans of the Vietnamese Front, now face
    the young, green, pudgy faced Swedish recruits who enlisted in the millions after
    Sweden’s quick, easy, and relatively painless against the decrepit old Finnish
    Empire. If the soldiers of Sweden think it will be so easy a second time, they
    are in for a shock.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene34.jpg
  narration: Former Norway lays defenseless, and Swedish high command knows it. They
    hope that the North Sea Nuclear Exchange keeps the Icelandic Forces too busy to
    begin a Naval Invasion, but already the IAF has taken Olso down to the yellow.
    Nowhere in Sweden is safe.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene35.jpg
  narration: 'A shot of the north reveals the laughable state of the once #1 Yakutia.
    Hopefully someone decides to come along and put them out of their misery. Meanwhile,
    Tobacco is now banned in this world, meaning all those who would smoke a pipe
    or cigarette are now legally required to vape. By the way, I personally find no
    issue with the fact that Battleship Texas has more votes in the World Congress
    than Armenia, but some may disagree.'
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene36.jpg
  narration: The Khan’s outdated Karpet looms over his next target, mockingly dubbed
    “Exclavia”,  but I don‘t understand his logic. There is no evidence to support
    open borders with Vietnam, so it‘s not like he can walk to Kekkonen hideout, but
    even if he could, the Finnish Army if actually more high-tech than Genghis’ so
    it might actually be a fair fight. Why not go for the undefended Vietnamese city
    of Bamda?
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene37.jpg
  narration: The war proceeds ahead of schedule, with Ufa falling a turn before I
    predicted. Leningrad is next, with the reclamation on the way. This may seem like
    Sweden is mounting a good defense, with the southern front reinforced with spider
    walkers, but this army has no reserves, with the lands past Gothenburg barren
    of any units at all.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene38.jpg
  narration: Kharkov is next on the Siberian chopping block, with Stalingrad not far
    behind. The north is even more bare than the south, and without some quick diplomacy
    Sibir might soon push into Scandinavia itself! Fun fact, if you go back to the
    previous slide, you can see that Jyvaskyla marks both the top and bottom of the
    Swedo-Siberian front.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene39.jpg
  narration: Iceland retaliates tenfold for last parts North Sea Nuclear Exchange,
    turning all of Mitteleuropa into a radioactive hellhole. The populace is decimated,
    the once mighty Berlin is brought to only one health, and likely would have been
    destroyed had it not been a original capital. What would that  medieval chieftain,
    Hitler, thought of his great tribe brought so low?
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene40.jpg
  narration: I am 76.362% sure that Lahti is a Siberian city,  and I must therefore
    chastise it for building useless naval units that will never see the front rather
    than bio-troopers that would grow the Siberian war machine into a force to be
    reckoned with.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene41.jpg
  narration: Here we see every research agreement in the world, and colour me surprised
    that these autocratic dictatorships are so willing to share technological secrets
    with each other. Perhaps fascism really does foster a spirit of brotherhood and
    sharing like all the propaganda said…
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene42.jpg
  narration: Nope! Nevermind! Australia and Vietnam unleash a thermonuclear holocaust
    on each other, likely killing millions of innocent Manchurians in the process.
    I remember a graph of all deaths by nuclear weapon earlier, perhaps that needs
    an update.
- scene_number: "43"

  narration: All for naught, not a single city changes hands.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene44.jpg
  narration: Vietnam flips Susa and Kabul back for a few minutes, resorting to their
    own nuking, and this front begins to look more and more like Sibir. Hopefully
    the Boer reinforcement wave around Gordium can push on to Isfahan, although it
    will not be without many more innocent dead. It seems the Trungs are building
    Hadrian’s Wall out of bodies and radiation.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene45.jpg
  narration: The Swedes reclaim Ufa for a hot second, however it will fall back into
    Sibir hands shortly. Leningrad is already halfway to capitulation, its ethnically
    Soviet citizens straining for the final overthrow of the Scandinavian Yoke. The
    question is, will Sibir be a better ruler?
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene46.jpg
  narration: Siberian Forces advance on Kharkov, and their AI bias towards Bio Infantry
    is illustrated for all to see.  I counted 56 on this slide alone, and that whole
    swarm is headed straight for the heart of Sweden.
- scene_number: "47"

  narration: Newton’s 3rd Law states an object in motion will stay in motion while
    an object at rest will remain at rest. Many were skeptical of the idea that his
    laws of physics would apply on a cylindrical planet, but the European front is
    clear evidence that inertia is alive and at work in the CBR.
- scene_number: "48"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene48.jpg
  narration: Here’s my question, why is Geelong in the red, while Medan remains untouched
    by the Vietnamese Bombing campaign? In other news, liberal Vietnamese use of napalm
    on the Jungle areas around My Son has raised controversy over the ethics behind
    this indiscriminate weapon.

  narration: A shot of the Vietnamese core reveals what a curbstomp it would be if
    Mongolia surprize attacked Vietnam. Come on Ghengis, this is your chance!
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part94-scene50.jpg
  narration: Fallout obscures the Vietnamese Manchurian cities, and the nuclear winter
    really sets in. Those who are left alive are painfully thin, and their eyes are
    pale and lifeless. The propaganda posters advertise a happy suburban life, nothing
    but a distant legend to the current residents.

  narration: The same is found on the other side of the Vietnamese Empire, with the
    mountain goat shepherds of the Mughal Kush bowing down to another sign from the
    vengeful gods. They had sent the pieces of the sun as punishment to the decadent
    Vietnamese. The goat shepherds only prayed now that their goats stopped growing
    so thin, and the the grass on the mountain would grow once again.

  narration: "“We must only give it one good kick, and the whole rotten structure
    will come falling down” - Kutcham Khan (on the war with Sweden). Ufa is surrounded,
    and it seems it may be the first golden block on the yellow brick road to Stockholm."

  narration: Iceland takes Cologne, and a cheeky Bio-Infantry is gonna take Munich
    next turn. Iceland really missed it’s chance here with this war, they could be
    at the gates of Berlin, if they had any units in Europe. Our settlers still have
    yet to move by they way, perhaps waiting for some cities to get nukes off the
    map.

  narration: Here we see that the Blackfoot are more than ready to put up a fight
    if the Inuit start  making trouble.  Their outdated carpet has been seen spilling
    all over the world, and while they would certainly lose any war with the White
    Walkers, it would hardly be a Divin-like rollover that many believe it would.
    A spy has something  to say to us, but the Nebby shushes them…

  narration: A look at the Kleptocratic Australian National Government Antarctic Reconnaissance
    Outpost Orange (K.A.N.G.A.R.O.O.) reveals that the Aussies intend to keep them
    the correct shade of green. Each one boasts an impressive carpet by Antarctic
    standards, the question is however, why are these troops not at the front?

  narration: Oh. That‘s why. The Australian government apparently has so much spare
    production on its hands that it can afford to have a massive blob of mostly useless
    ships just sitting around doing nothing. Never change Henry Parkes, never change.

  narration: A glance at Mongolia’s outdated carpet. Now if only it was in action
    against someone!  Perhaps next part will be your chance to shine Ghengis.

  narration: The Koreans sail a Nuke by the north coast of Sibir. Is this a sign of
    a backstab to come, or is this bomb intended for a more distant target? What could
    Nebby be trying to show us here? We can only pray that the oracles can interpret
    this.

  narration: Were back to where we started on this front, with the Viets preparing
    to add another few million to the nuclear deathtoll. Will the Boers be able to
    break through next part? Will Armenia surprise attack and steal all the Boer gains?
    No one knows. The only thing that is certain is that countless more lives will
    be lost before this particular war comes to an end.

  narration: Kharkov falls to Sibir, Stalingrad and Leningrad are not far behind.
    Khutchum Khan really did make the right choice with this war, and his people will
    be better off because of it. On the side, we see hundreds of research agreements,
    DoFs and denunciations neglected.

  narration: Icelandic troops take Taega, proving even they can push against Sweden.
    Perhaps they could even reclaim Constantinople, and try and reclaim their Capital
    lead. Iceland’s status is currently in a flux, but if they can make substantial
    gains, they might be giants.

  narration: Cologne, and the rest of the Benelux, falls back into Swedish hands,
    and the stalemate continues in Northern Europe. If Iceland could please commit
    the production necessary to send Armies down here that would be nice. Within a
    few parts, this land could be a Sibir grey, and Iflgor must hurry to stop that.

  narration: Here we can see the Icelandic Fleet, unfortunately on the wrong side
    of the Irish Isles.  Some hoped that the war would thin Iceland’s supply of useless
    carriers, but this seems unlikely. Hilariously, the Inuit have claimed some lands
    on the far side of the Icelandic home, though how they justify said claims is
    beyond me.

  narration: Sejong’s oceanic tarmac is one to make even Iceland jealous, and it is
    in dire need of a cleansing. Perhaps Australia or the Inuit could oblige…

  narration: 'Info Addict begins and here we see why many rankers chose Australia
    for the #2 spot. Their military is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition,
    and it‘s not all useless carriers.'

    of Vietnam.

  narration: Ah, here we see that Fascist regimes are always friends with everyone,
    although, there may be a bug, as it seems that Vietnam and Australia have a DoF.

    the old world, and the Blackfoot replicate their earlier new world religious success.

  narration: The Boers take 3 out of the top 5 Cities in the world, a real achievement
    for a nation many believed would be fodder for Shaka’s Impis.

    These match up pretty closely with our own community power rankings, with some
    exceptions.

    of Battleship Texas. I have been /u/Lordfowl (and the talented /u/Dawkinzz for
    the audio narration), have a wonderful day, and tune in next week for another
    glorious installment of the Civ Battle Royale!
