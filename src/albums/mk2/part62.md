    Gather ‘round folks, for Part 62 of the Civ Battle Royale! I’m your narrator, /u/patkellyrh of Power Rankings infamy. This is an emergency rush narration, so please be forgiving of any errors – just kidding, I know y’all will skewer me in the comments.
    Big props as always to TPang for the huge amount of work that it takes to put this together – 103.2 hours in just the past two weeks. And credit to /u/Cadellinman for this awesome cover art.

    Our map is poised for big changes this part. Vietnam and Australia are facing off in the Green Screen of Death War, and Sweden and Finland (with a little help from their friends) are finally doing something about Europe’s bordergore.

  narration: 'In a close and contentious shift, the Boers have been bounced out of
    the top spot in the Power Rankings for the first time since Part 47. They really
    brought this on themselves though, they could have long since plowed through Africa
    if they were just more aggressive, and I suspect that they could take the #1 spot
    back if they invade someone this part.'

  narration: The scene is set for an epic showdown around Moscow. IRL Russia has tremendous
    strategic depth that has allowed her to win major wars throughout history, but
    here, Stalin is backed into a narrow strip of land. Finland has a definite tech
    edge in this shot, nearly limitless reserves, and some more advanced units lurking
    to the north.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: 6
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene06.jpg
  narration: Zooming out, we get a better view of how badly outnumbered the Soviets
    are. Kiev is already down to zero health, and Finnish units are knocking on the
    gates of Minsk. It does look like Stalin is taking a crack at Poznan, but even
    if he can flip it somehow, he’ll never hold it.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: 7
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene07.jpg
  narration: Minsk also goes down to zero health, and the offensive around Poznan
    has evaporated. Stalin’s UA, Warsaw Pact, is that “Enemy units may take extra
    damage inside your borders”, plus some city-state boosts that won’t help him here.
    That extra damage probably won’t be decisive, but it may make the USSR a slightly
    tougher nut to crack than they appear at first glance.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene08.jpg
  narration: The first flashpoint between Australia and Vietnam is in the East Indies,
    comfortably away from both of their cores. All of the cities along the border
    have taken massive damage, and while the Vietnamese around My So’n are outnumbered,
    they look like they’re dug in for a real fight.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9

  narration: The always reliable Ishtar tells us that Henry Morgan is plotting against
    Mexico. Our favorite pirate is a bit overdue to conquer someone, but this would
    be a tough approach for him. The Mexican border is mountainous and heavily defended,
    and Morgan’s access through the Gulf of Mexico is only one tile wide. He can move
    his fleet into the Pacific via Nassau, but conquering Benito would extend his
    land border with the Inuit, which he may not be ready for just yet.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene10.jpg
  narration: |-
    Henry Morgan is so in love with the sea, he demanded that his admirals carpet the Caribbean with aircraft carriers, so that he could get around without his pegleg ever touching dry land. The good news is that if that single plane in Georgetown ever has technical problems, it’ll have plenty of places to land.
    Note the swarm of workers in the east, presumably headed to Mali and Marrrocco to clean up from the invasion.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene11.jpg
  narration: |-
    My So’n is down to zero health, and a digger is ready to make the capture, inspired by PM Julia Gillard coming to the front. To the far north, we can see that Manila is also at zero health. Losing both of those would be problematic for the Trung Sisters; holding at least some of the first island chain here gives them a strong defensive buffer, and keeps the Wobbegong Armada out of the South China Sea, allowing Vietnam relatively free movement to the front.
    I count 52 Australian air units in this shot, as compared to 39 Vietnamese. Slight advantage there for the Australians, but probably not a decisive one.

  narration: 'Finally, a slide of the war that everyone really cares about: Hawaii’s
    bold struggle for survival. Korea and Sibir both declared war on Kamehameha last
    part, but don’t seem to be making any aggressive moves in his direction yet. Korea
    is busy eyeing the Green Screen of Death War, where they could likely tip the
    balance either way. Vietnam is outnumbered on this front, but has a good chance
    at flipping Iloilo. To the south, Australian destroyers could take Cebu and Caloocan
    next turn.'
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene13.jpg
  narration: To the north, we can see that My So’n has fallen. All of the fighting
    up there has woken Jandamarra up from a long nap. He remembers how much fun a
    war can be, and DoW’s Japan. He doesn’t have much of a navy left, and would need
    to move pretty much all of it up north to have a shot, but it’s not impossible.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene14.jpg
  narration: Brazil joins in on the DoW against Japan, which gives us an excuse to
    take a look at their core. This is a pretty classic case of cities being so densely
    settled that they hurt each other, but this is still an impressive showing, and
    they vastly outnumber their neighbor to the north. Bucc power armor infantry is
    probably worth at least two paratroopers in a fight, but even at those odds, they’d
    be overrun quickly.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene15.jpg
  narration: |-
    My So’n looks like it’ll remain in Australian hands for at least another turn. East of Manila, Legash and Zamboanga have lost a ton of population since the last time we saw them – can’t tell from here if they were flipped, or if they got nuked and have since been reinforced with more units.
    The World Congress votes to ban silver, and Yukon Cornelius totally loses his shit.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene16.jpg
  narration: The World Congress also decides to leave the embargo against Finland
    in place. As retribution, paratruupers roll through Minsk, capturing both the
    city and the world’s largest contiguous citadel carpet. This also closes off Sweden’s
    border with the Soviets, precluding any gains for them in this war unless they
    can sneak some paratroopers in.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene17.jpg
  narration: A lone paratrooper is all that remains of Stalin’s attempt to snipe Yerevan.
    We can also see that Leonidas is spending more time on leg day than on reinforcing
    any of his new territory. The Middle East would be a cakewalk for Ethiopia right
    now, and even Persia could pick up a city or two.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene18.jpg
  narration: Japan readies for war! Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and even Tibet join what’s
    now a five-way war for a single city. Despite these overwhelming odds, Emperor
    Meiji is defiant. His fleet sets sail for…oh, right, sails…good luck mate.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene19.jpg
  narration: North and east of Japan, overflowing embarked unit carpets meet in the
    freezing waters of the Pacific, but are completely unable to damage each other.
    A handful of naval units on either side could have a field day up here, but instead
    it’s the world’s largest game of bumper cars.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene20.jpg
  narration: It looks like losing My So’n has gotten the Vietnamese to take this war
    seriously. They’re filling the South China Sea with both land and naval units,
    and they’ve brought an atomic bomb and drone fighters along for the fun.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene21.jpg
  narration: Australian subs arrive just in time to disrupt the Iloilo offensive,
    but they won’t be able to take Cebu or Caloocan. Further south, Zamboanga falls
    to Vietnam, but an advanced destroyer is poised to take it back. The Trungs are
    going nuts with the carriers here, and have loaded units on to almost all of them.
    Are you taking notes, Morgan?
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene22.jpg
  narration: |-
    TIRIDATES WILL NOT BE TRIFLED WITH.
    Moscow has fallen to Finland, but somehow that’s less important right now than an Armenian paratrooper managing to snipe Kiev.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene23.jpg
  narration: Picking up two new cities has barely thinned out Finland’s carpet, and
    while they haven’t fully upgraded yet, there’s a wide selection of future eras
    units mixed in now. Only seven air units in this shot though, Helsinki directly
    borders Swedish territory thanks to an especially aggressive citadel, and Sibir
    is looming to the east. Still a precarious position for Kekkonen.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene24.jpg
  narration: Apparently the Trungs aren’t content with just one massive war, now they
    want to open a western front too. Gordium immediately falls to the red, but Susa
    could fall to the Persian navy. With the narrow mountain pass and Mongolian peacekeepers
    in the mix, Vietnam may have just as much trouble getting into Gordium as Afghanistan
    did for centuries.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene25.jpg
  narration: |-
    This is big folks! After carefully weighing the merits of intervening on either side of the Green Screen of Death War, Sejong of Korea casts his very advanced army against…Mongolia! Sejong establishes himself as the eternal defender of Japan.
    Actually, it’s kind of brilliant – his more powerful neighbors are distracted, and if he can get around the Boer peacekeepers, Mongolia has a really solid core that would help Korea bulk up. Genghis is finally rolling around in modern armor, but he’s still badly out-teched here.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene26.jpg
  narration: Australindia and former Sri Lanka is getting pounded by the Vietnamese
    Air Force. I don’t know if this fall out is from a new nuking, or if its left
    over from when Sri Lanka got lit up like the Fourth of July, but either way, the
    Trung Sisters could actually make some gains out here where Parkes can’t easily
    rush reinforcements.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene27.jpg
  narration: A Soviet AA gun forces its way back into Kiev. It was glorious while
    it lasted, but Armenia probably won’t get another shot at this.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene28.jpg
  narration: Former French lands are almost exclusively occupied by Finnish and Australian
    overflow. If they ever go to war with Finland, Sweden will be attacked from two
    sides. Iceland has already annexed most of these cities, and is sporting quite
    a few advanced units, but their land carpet is pretty threadbare.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene29.jpg
  narration: More Vietnamese peacekeepers float around the Pacific looking for something
    to ram their transports into. Unfortunately, they found that in the shape of an
    advanced destroyer and some subs. This will be an absolute slaughter.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene30.jpg
  narration: Remember Chile? Once upon a time, it felt like a coinflip if they would
    dominate South America or if Brazil would. Still, despite some losses along the
    way, they have a pretty solid core carved out of this narrow bit of land, and
    at 40 pop, Copiapo might be the largest city in the world.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Wobbegong Armada is made up of literally hundreds of ships, most
    paired with embarked land units, patiently waiting their turn to be fed into the
    Vietnamese meatgrinder.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene32.jpg
  narration: Gordium is ready to flip, and with it, the one unit that makes up the
    Persian Air Force. Susa is still damaged, but I like their odds of surviving the
    Great General blockade.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene33.jpg
  narration: Mongolian cities are badly damaged, but their army is on the offensive
    around Shanghai and Beijing, and more or less holds the passes around Guangzhou,
    with some help from the Finns and Boers. Korea can’t make full use of its XCOMs
    until tiles actually open up in Mongolian lands.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene34.jpg
  narration: Brazil has joined the Yakutian peacekeeper club, and while the Snoryaks
    have declared war on Afghanistan, it’s not likely they can reach any of Hotak’s
    cities. Their land army is still awfully sparse too, they really never rebuilt
    after the meatgrinder wars with the Inuit and Sibir.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene35.jpg
  narration: Iceland becomes the sixth civ to DoW Japan. Maybe Osaka can become a
    giant timeshare, where each power involved in the war gets the city for two months
    each year. To the east, the Wobbegong Armada has found more exposed Vietnamese
    bumper-boats.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene36.jpg
  narration: Zamboanga, Manila and Caloocan are all in Australian hands. Is Parkes
    finally punching through?
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene37.jpg
  narration: Whangarei has flipped, and there might be enough Vietnamese paratroopers
    here to hold on to it. Ambon and My So’n look ready to flip too, but can the Trungs
    push land units across the sea quickly enough to make up for their losses?
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene38.jpg
  narration: The offensive around Australindia has fizzled out. This was probably
    Vietnam’s best chance at taking cities they could hold longterm.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene39.jpg
  narration: Kiev falls again, but this time to Finland. With only a settler and a
    great musician left to carry on, the Soviet Union is eliminated in 28th. They
    held on longer than we expected them to, probably longer than they deserved to,
    and just long enough to be humiliated by Armenia.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene40.jpg
  narration: The Snoryaks awaken! Yakutia jumps on to the Japanese dogpile, but is
    actually in a position to do something. Trigger Darkhan has very few troops or
    ships in position, but has already knocked Osaka to 0 HP, and it will only take
    a few advanced destroyers and arsenal ships to turn that wooden Japanese fleet
    into kindling.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene41.jpg
  narration: Vietnam takes Gordium and looks like they’ll hold it. This puts them
    just two tiles away from Persepolis, but the approach is packed with Mongol troops.
    Susa is down to 3 pop, from 9 last time we saw it, suggesting it’s flipped back
    and forth.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene42.jpg
  narration: The Buccs are founding new cities like Ciudad de Carmen, but they aren’t
    doing anything to reinforce Marrrocco. Where could all of their troops be? Maybe
    invading Chile!
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene43.jpg
  narration: Henry Morgan teams up with Australia and Ethiopia in a war that has the
    potential to finish off Chile. Chile starts by capturing Tiwanaku, but it’ll be
    tough for them to hold it, a lesson they’ve probably learned from spending the
    whole game fighting over this stretch of coastline.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene44.jpg
  narration: The Wobbegong Armada begins to slide east toward Chile. Australia has
    more than enough troops to spare without hurting their war effort against Vietnam.
    The staging area at Tulum should come in handy here.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene45.jpg
  narration: Yakutia continues to bomb Osaka, but hasn’t made any moves to get other
    units into the fight.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene46.jpg
  narration: Chile will struggle in this war, but they’ve mostly carpeted, and their
    tech is passable if not particularly impressive. It’s pretty late in the game
    to be rolling around in tanks, but the rocket artillery will do a lot to slow
    down invaders and soften up any captured cities that need to be flipped back.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene47.jpg
  narration: Vietnam has taken back Caloocan and Manila, and the island is now bristling
    with artillery. Their reserves can’t be too far off screen, but for now, Australia
    doesn’t have the troops on hand to take these back.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene48.jpg
  narration: The Trungs also take back My So’n, hold on to Whangarei, and are in position
    to flip Ambon and maybe even Mataram. Even so, on this front there’s no shortage
    of diggers waiting to come ashore and keep the bloodbath going.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene49.jpg
  narration: Beijing and Shanghai are taking a beating and could actually fall to
    the Mongols. The Korean air force is pounding cities like Otrar, but the Korean
    army can’t force their way through.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene50.jpg
  narration: Vietnam holds on to both Gordium and Susa, while bringing Persepolis
    down to a sliver of health. All they need is an opening for their paratroopers;
    if Persepolis falls, there’s a good chance the rest of Persia will follow.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene51.jpg
  narration: |-
    Sparta declares war on Persia just as the Trungs are cracking their defenses! Tonight, they dine in hell!
    Their army is getting awfully small though. We’ve seen throughout this part that there are barely any units in the land they just conquered from Carthage or Armenia, and there’s really not that much of it here in their core either.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene52.jpg
  narration: The Korean-Mongolian front remains static, but that doesn’t mean units
    aren’t dying by the dozen between slides. The problem for Korea is that for every
    Mongol unit they kill, a Boer peacekeeper takes its place.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene53.jpg
  narration: The Persian Navy rallies long enough to sneak a privateer in and flip
    Susa. Persepolis is still in the red though, and there’s finally an open tile
    next to it…
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene54.jpg
  narration: Persepolis falls! Susa also flips back, and there are already 7 or 8
    Vietnamese paratroopers surrounding Persepolis to lock it down. To the west, Sparta
    hasn’t really brought troops to this fight, and Gaza and Artashat are getting
    pounded, but it’s unlikely Darius can spare the troops for an actual offensive.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene55.jpg
  narration: Vietnam further solidifies their hold on My So’n and Whangarei, while
    carpet bombing cities as far east as Port Macquarie. For the first time, holes
    in the Aussie carpet are starting to show – they still have the advantage in numbers,
    but it’s noticeably less dramatic. To compensate, Parkes has sent at least three
    nuclear missiles to the front.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene56.jpg
  narration: Lhasa may look peaceful, but don’t forget that these bloodthirsty monks
    are at war with Japan right now. And ominously, we’re ending on turn 666…
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene57.jpg
  narration: No big surprises here, but note how Australia is three times the size
    of Vietnam. Chile has gotten a bump since last part, so they must have held on
    to Tiwanaku.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene58.jpg
  narration: Compared to last part, Australia has lost about 40,000 troops, and Vietnam
    has lost about 191,000. Actual casualties are much higher than that of course,
    but it does mean that Vietnam’s production isn’t quite keeping up – not too surprising
    considering they fought two major wars and also lost huge numbers of defenseless
    embarked units.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part62-scene59.jpg
  narration: Finland picked up three techs this part, moving from 9th place to 7th,
    but not quite catching up to their rivals Sweden. Australia picks up a small,
    one tech lead over Vietnam.
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: 60

    Vietnam.
