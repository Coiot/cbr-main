      trying to decide which island to send their settler to. \nBonus: Australia‘s cities

      The Inuit have founded their fourth city, settling Kangiqtiniq on a tile
      with--shockingly--no adjacent snow or tundra. Meanwhile, they have yet another
      settler on the move, perhaps looking to claim Nunavut.

      The Sioux are on a land-grabbing spree, having settled Yankton on Turn
      28 and Oglala on Turn 29. Not only that, they have two more Settlers ready to
      claim even more land! The Blackfoot may be in trouble if they can‘t keep up, or
      if they fail to launch an attack south before they‘re crushed between the Sioux
      and the Inuit.

      Mexico to the south settles their third city, Guadalajara, in the remote
      mountains of the Mexican homeland. Texas, too, seems eager to get in on the land
      rush, sending two Settlers north. Additionally, it is worth noting that Texas‘s
      military is pointed at Mexico City.

      Last installment, Canada forward-settled the United States offscreen,
      with the city of Montreal pressing up against Washington. However, an American
      Settler seems ready to cut off Canada‘s easy access to the south by settling a
      city between Lake Michigan and Lake Erie, forever dashing the hopes of a Canifest
      Destiny repeat.

      The Phillipines have the new city of Cebu to the north, brushing the
      underside of the mainland. Vietnam and the Champa both have a Settler at the ready--however,
      the purple pirates are in a better position to settle the fertile and unclaimed
      area in between Vijaya, Mandalay, and Hanoi. Vietnam, meanwhile, can expand northwards
      in hope of escaping the cramped conditions of Indochina.

      Chaos. The Polish, Romans, Spartans, and Germans are all competing for
      land in central Europe, as the Byzantines focus on the western shore of the Black
      Sea. Russia is sending a Settler west, presumably to have a front row seat for
      the inevitable Great European Clusterduck.

      Meanwhile, in northern Europe, things are marginally more calm. Sweden
      is preparing to settle their third city to try and gain an upper hand over Norway,
      and Finland has made the questionable decision to settle Tampere on the doorstep
      of the Russian bear... You know, when there‘s plenty of room towards his own uncontested
      north...

      Iceland continues to do their thing. If they can settle the entirety
      of Greenland, they could become a fairly solid turtle, or even challenge whoever
      comes out on top in the British Isles. Though they‘re certainly at least eyeing
      that empty Scottish land to the south...

      "A glimpse of Northwest Africa: So far, all three major civs in this
      area are fairly solid. However, both Morocco and Mali are on their way to founding
      a third city, and Carthage doesn‘t even have their third Settler out yet. If they
      can‘t keep up in the land rush, then Carthage may find that they won‘t have the
      muscle to challenge Rome later on. \nBonus: The Ashanti continue their 'Workers
      without Borders' programme."

      "In the Middle East, the Ayyyyyyyyyyyyubids have founded Baalbek along
      the Nile. Their cities have some major growth potential later on, especially once
      they research Civil Service and get that sweet +1 food bonus on farms next to
      fresh water. This, combined with their Suez Canal, paints a large target on their
      back. Arabia has been fairly bland so far, and are on their way to a third city.
      \nFinally, the Mossad is watching. The Mossad is always watching."

      Sri Lanka continues in their quest to settle the mainland of the Indian
      subcontinent, sending one Settler north. If they can establish a firm hold on
      the area, they‘ll be a regional power in no time... Or, at the very least, a turtle
      that nobody wants to mess with.

      "The Mughals did extremely well in the last installment, shooting up
      the power rankings due to their high population, advanced tech, and good placement.
      There‘s still plenty of room for them to expand to the south. However, they still
      only have two cities, and Afghanistan looks poised to cut off any attempted northward
      Mughal advance. \nTibet is a very interesting civ, as the geography of their area
      makes it very hard for an invader to succeed. If they can grow beyond their mountain
      home, then they could very well be a force to be reckoned with. On the other hand,
      if they end up locked inside the Himalayas, we can at least be sure that they
      would be the MOTHER of all turtles (at least until artillery and airplanes start
      appearing)."

      "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE OUR FIRST WAR! \nFrance and Sparta have
      both declared war on Rome, creating the first of what will doubtlessly be many,
      many wars to be fought on European soil. Augustus may be vulnerable here, as he
      only has 3 warriors to defend against Napoleon (whose military is slightly larger
      than Rome‘s) and Leonidas (whose military is far larger). Rome will be relying
      on the natural defenses of the Alps to defend themselves on land, but they remain
      vulnerable from the sea."

      "Long have the ancients told of a mystical land known as 'South America',
      where it is whispered that four civilizations thrive in secret. Only rarely has
      history glimpsed this exotic and mysterious land, but today its existence is confirmed,
      and this dark continent is brought into the light. \nChile builds the Temple of
      Artemis, sending a Settler over the Andes to forward-settle Argentina‘s southern
      border. Eva, meanwhile, has very strong population growth, and she sends her own
      Settler north to compete with Brazil."

      "Leonidas and Attila both declare war on Russia! Considering he‘s already
      at war with Rome, has Leonidas bitten off more than he can chew? Carthage made
      a similar blunder in the last Battle Royale, declaring on France and Rome in the
      midst of a war with Mali, and it led to French North Africa becoming a reality.
      \nMinsk (Russia), Nicaea (Byzantium), and Corinth (Sparta) are all founded, as
      Sparta continues to move troops north."

      The Buccaneers are doing quite well for themselves, having built the
      Panama Canal in Nassau, and settled all three islands of Jamaica, Hispaniola,
      and Cuba in search of rum and booty (... NOW I see why the fanbase identifies
      with them so closely…). Their challenge now will be expanding onto the mainland
      further.

      Our first real look at Central Africa so far this installment. By settling
      Bloemfontein and Pietersburg in the face of a very territorial Kongo, Paul Kruger
      appears to be taking a big risk. Will this hurt the Boers‘ chances of achieving
      Draka Domination?

      Norway has declared war on Sweden to prove that lutefisk is superior
      to meatballs. Given that Germany and their bratwurst are also targeting the Swedes,
      the War of the Regional Cuisines may turn out poorly for Gustavus Adolphus--if
      Harald figures out that armies of settlers are very inefficient at conquering
      other nations.

      "The Kimberley have settled a fourth city, and have continued to grow
      their empire satisfactorily. It’s all but inevitable that they will end up in
      an epic war with Australia at some point to control the continent, and the winner
      of that clash will become a major world power. Given that each civ has been relatively
      isolated from one another, with plenty of room to grow, this will be very good
      theatre. \nThe shrimp is already on the bah’bie--Who will light the grill?"

      The Inuit continue their slow crawl eastward, and a cold wind begins
      to blow throughout the land. Crowfoot and Lester B. Pearson have received white
      ravens, telling of the oncoming winter. However, they are understandably confused,
      as winter is a relatively predictable seasonal occurrence. Also, it’s August.

      The founding of Sisseton is establishing the Sioux hold over the American
      midwest. Additionally, their other settler is heading into the Nevada desert.
      Once the land rush has ended, they will control a geographically large empire,
      which will be advantageous if they can defend it.

      Here’s a shocker! The Zulus were destroyed in the Power Rankings after it seemed inevitable that they would once again be nothing more than the footstool of the Boers. However, they’ve settled a chain of cities leading to the potential of further colonization up the African coast. If they can defend these gains against possible Boer aggression--or even go on the attack themselves--we may see Shaka turn into the regional power he was born to be.
      Also: Note that Hitler, wishing to show the world that there’s no party like a Nazi Party, has joined the war against Rome.

      A view of war-torn (?) Europe. It seems to be a relatively bloodless
      stalemate so far, with Rome protected by her geography from the three aggressive
      neighbours trying to break in. Sparta’s army is quite big, though Cumae is easily
      defensible. Now if only the Spartans could figure out how to sail...

      Mongolia, initially expected to be a fierce warmonger, is turning out
      to be little more than a paper tiger so far, with only three cities to their name,

      Morocco, on the other hand, seems to be exceeding expectations. They’ve
      settled two more cities, and while their military is small, they aren’t under
      any immediate threat from Mali or Carthage. Like Mongolia, Carthage is supposedly
      a warmonger, but they’ve shown little aggression or drive. Mali continues to exist,
      with absolutely no drama. Finally, the Ashanti workers appear to be lost in the
      desert (perhaps they can find an Israeli scout to help them out).

    narration:
      By founding Toronto, Canada has effectively blocked any American attempts
      at northward expansion, and they currently have a settler en route to establish
      a secure western border. Hey, it’s no Canifest Destiny, but it does the job.

    narration:
      The Inuit continue in expanding their snowy domain. It seems inevitable
      that war on this continent will break out soon; peace has reigned for too long,
      and land is going to become scarce in short order.

    narration:
      Sweden moves to settle some of the prime land in northern Finland which
      Urho left untouched. Meanwhile, the War of the Regional Cuisines has gone rather
      stale, with both sides trying in vain to win with their famously incompetent Settler
      Brigades. Still no sign of German troops in the vicinity.

      At last, Iceland reaches the fabled land of North America, and is immediately
      greeted awkwardly by their snowy cousins, the Inuit. But of course, there’s only
      room in this Battle Royale for one ice fetishist.

      And now, the statistics for the end of this installment! The Mughals
      still lead in population, followed by Vietnam, Argentina, the Soviet Union, and
      Yakutia.

    narration:
      Unsurprisingly, the Inca are in last place in population, as their food-heavy
      UI doesn’t come along until Construction. However, Mongolia, Israel, and the Zulus
      are all members of the low-pop club. Given that all three were favoured going
      into the match, it seems like a red flag that they can’t maintain a high enough
      population to effectively warmonger.

    narration:
      China’s military is the largest, followed by that of the Huns. Surprisingly,
      third place is Ethiopia, a civ we’ve barely covered so far. They may have a major
      effect on the face of Africa if they end up going to war in the near future, so
      that’s something to look out for in future installments.

      The Inuit and Sioux are tied for the most cities, followed by NINE civs

      Carthage is in last place with two cities, behind a pack of three-city
      nations as far as the eye can see. Unless they get their head on straight, Carthage
      will doubtlessly be held back by their lack of early expansion.
