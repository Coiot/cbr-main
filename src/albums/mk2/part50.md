  narration: "Welcome one and all the Civ Battle Royale‘s 50th Birthday! Like all
    good birthdays, I can only hope this will be filled with excitement, surprises,
    and widespread thermonuclear destruction. I‘m u/PablodiSplooge, and it‘s my pleasure
    to be guiding you anonymous internet strangers through this very important installment
    of everyone‘s favourite legal high. \nPride of place on our titlecard today goes
    to this beautiful illustration by u/Jru247."

    and u/Malistrassa - shows us the current state of the world.

  narration: "At the end of the last part, the mighty Power Ranking Oracles awarded
    the Boers the top spot by virtue of their immense technology lead and impressive
    military. With new transcontinental wars breaking out left, right and centre,
    will they do enough this part to retain their position? \nHere are all of the

  narration: Squadrons of helicopter gunships patrol Korea‘s newly-acquired borders,
    sending reports back to Seoul of a vast Vietnamese force amassing near... well,
    everywhere. The Trung Sisters insist that their troops are merely passing through.
- scene_number: "5"

  narration: At the western edge of the Vietnamese empire, the Trung Sisters continue
    their assault on Jalalabad (Afghanistan). Although Vietnam possesses an overwhelming
    force of paratroopers, many of the Afghan cities in this region are firmly entrenched
    in the Himalayas and backed up by artillery. This could be an unnecessarily drawn-out
    and bloody conflict for the Trungs.

  narration: In South America, pillars of smoke hint at just how much of the fighting
    took place on Chilean soil in the last part. The recently ended war cost both
    sides dearly, as can be seen by the relatively thin armies on either side of the
    border. Although greatly weakened, Chile still has complete naval dominance of
    the area.
- scene_number: "7"

  narration: A brave Inuit settler decides to make a new home in the flaming nuclear
    hellscape of Chukotka. Apparently he is as unphased by the prospect of radiation
    poisoning as he is by the nearby Yakutian bazooka.
- scene_number: '08'

  narration: Mirwais Hotak (Afghanistan) defiantly completes the Kremlin as a massive
    middle finger to the tide of Autocratic empires across the globe. The +50% production
    bonus to armor units may help him beef up his defensive force against the invading
    Vietnamese.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene09.jpg
  narration: A fleet of Buccaneer ships moves inexorably towards Mali. Sources confirm
    that their words are indeed backed with nuclear weapons. In another part of the
    world, Sri Lanka and Champa make peace.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene10.jpg
  narration: Chile takes advantage of its new North American holdings to begin trade
    with Europe. We can also catch a glimpse of the disparity between Inuit and Canadian
    forces in the area, as power armor infantry face down machine guns and paratroopers.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene11.jpg
  narration: Moroccan ships surround Carthage‘s capital and only remaining city, as
    the last remnants of the Portuguese army look on from the island of Sardinia.
    The city looks set to fall very soon.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene12.jpg
  narration: Half a world away, Chế Bồng Nga (Champa) finds himself in a very similar
    situation, with the city of My So‘n on zero health and Vietnamese units closing
    in. Unless something drastic happens, we could be looking at at least a double
    elimination this part.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene13.jpg
  narration: The Stop Online Piracy Alliance (SOPA) continues as Australian privateers
    re-engage Tulum, but the majority of Parkes‘ navy watches on from the sidelines.
    What could they be waiting for?
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene14.jpg
  narration: As expected, Yakutian forces seize our brave Inuit settler, who immediately
    gives up on his dream of founding a new city and decides to try out a new career
    in manual labour. He‘ll probably be set to work in the Yakutian city of Talayoak
    on that island to the north. Or at least he would have, if it hadn’t just been
    NUKED OFF OF THE FUCKING MAP.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene15.jpg
  narration: An impressive string of citadels allow Spartan units to walk from Dvin
    right to the gates of Jerusalem (Armenia) without ever stepping outside. Dvin‘s
    recent conversion to Islam can mean only one thing... the Party Prophet has partied
    his last, and the last of the Ayyubids has left this world :(
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene16.jpg
  narration: Here we can see the full extent of the fleet that Henry Parkes (Australia)
    has committed to SOPA, which includes a captured Buccaneer corsair. In other news...
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene17.jpg
  narration: "Champa has been eliminated by Vietnam, finishing 36th in the Battle
    Royale, and the last Champan rifleman considers his options. Should he stay fortified
    and die at the hands of the Trungs, or try and retake the city and die even faster?
    \nBeginning the game with a power ranking of #58 due to their unenviable start
    location and fierce local competition, they‘ve done very well to make it this
    far in a war-torn world. At their time of elimination, the Champa were sitting
    pretty on a treasury in excess of 800,000 gold - almost 500,000 MORE than the
    closest competitor, Australia. Old Chế Bồng Nga must have been doing something
    right; sadly, that thing was not war. Farewell, My So‘n."

  narration: In the very same turn, Hannibal‘s empire crumbles as Carthage is captured
    by a Moroccan privateer. We‘re not even 20 slides in and two civs have been eliminated.
    TPang pls, I can only get so erect.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene19.jpg
  narration: Babylonian spies report that Gustavus Adolphus (Sweden) is hell-bent
    on wiping the Spartan empire off the face of the earth, while rumours abound in
    Sejong‘s (Korea) imperial court of a potential war with Sri Lanka.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene20.jpg
  narration: The Australian fleet continues its war on piracy but has yet to make
    any ground. Tulum is dangerously close to falling and privateers have taken Corihuayrachina
    into the yellow, but for some reason Parkes is reluctant to bring his battleships
    within firing distance of either city.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene21.jpg
  narration: The Inuit appear to have taken Isit with an advanced destroyer and immediately
    negotiated a peace treaty with Yakutia. This has been a long, bloody, and particularly
    nuclear conflict which saw the complete and utter destruction of a number of Yakutian
    cities. Perhaps this will give both sides a chance to lick their wounds.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene22.jpg
  narration: Back in the Pacific, Parkes (Australia) tries to take Vitcos from the
    Buccaneers with one of their own captured ships. You got some balls Parkes, but
    I don‘t think it‘s going to be enough.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene23.jpg
  narration: In Asia, Afghanistan retakes Balkh from Vietnam, while to the north Jalalabad
    is brought into the yellow.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene24.jpg
  narration: Kamehameha (Hawaii) pressures his military scientists to develop more
    potent weaponry to combat the growing Wobbegong threat. They respond by successfully
    testing a weapon that requires resources that cannot be found anywhere within
    the Hawaiian empire.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene25.jpg
  narration: Brave Carthaginian forces retake their capital, only to have it immediately
    captured again by Morocco, leaving them at a respectable 35th place. Carthage
    has certainly been one of the more entertaining Civs to watch, somehow managing
    to take cities from the Ashanti, Sparta, Ayyubids, Morocco, Rome, Portugal, AND
    Kongo, despite prioritising elephants over things like education and science.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene26.jpg
  narration: Intercepted communications from high-ranking officials in Stockholm reveal
    that war could be brewing between Sweden and France. Any conflict between these
    two Civs would likely be very one-sided.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene27.jpg
  narration: The mountainous terrain is making progress difficult for the Trungs (Vietnam)
    but Balkh has been retaken and Jalalabad finally looks close to falling.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene28.jpg
  narration: Aaaand there it goes. The mountain stronghold of Jalalabad is taken,
    and fresh Vietnamese forces drop in near Kandahar (Afghanistan).
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene29.jpg
  narration: 'When half the world declares war on you, and you‘re sailing to a war
    within spitting distance of the single most technologically advanced army on the
    planet, there‘s only one thing you need to remember: bring nukes. Henry Morgan
    knows this.'
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene30.jpg
  narration: At this point it‘s worth recapping the expanded Future Worlds tech tree,
    where the next major milestone is Microscale Engineering. No prizes for guessing
    who could have already unlocked this technology.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene31.jpg
  narration: As if there was any competition. The peerless Boer military now includes
    advanced destroyers, power armor infantry, drone fighters, and mech artillery.
    Oh, and this new thing just south of Ulundi called...
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene32.jpg
  narration: A GIANT DEATH ROBOT. With a combat strength of 150, the Boers are truly
    cementing their position as the world’s uncontested military power. The notifications
    bar reveals that Afghanistan has made peace with Mexico, and the SOPA initiative
    has already begun to break apart - both Yakutia and Armenia lose interest in the
    war on piracy and make peace with the Buccaneers.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene33.jpg
  narration: Here we see the Icelandic territory of Greenland, populated by copper
    mines, communications arrays, and the world‘s loneliest great musician, prowling
    the frozen wastes in search of an audience.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene34.jpg
  narration: Covered by a relentless downpour of artillery fire, Afghan infantry have
    retaken the city of Jalalabad - although it’s unlikely that they will be able
    to hold the position for long. Vietnam appears to have consolidated their position
    around Balkh to the south.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene35.jpg
  narration: The Boer army in Yakutia is getting completely out of hand. Rumors have
    begun to spread among the population as to the true intentions of these supposed
    ‘peacekeeping‘ forces, and the political situation remains tense.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene36.jpg
  narration: The Australian fleet continues to excel at not taking cities, and the
    Buccaneer defensive force has done a fantastic job of eliminating every unit capable
    of melee combat. Henry Morgan is earning a reputation as one of the world’s foremost
    naval tacticians.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene37.jpg
  narration: In the Atlantic, shit gets real as a Buccaneer atom bomb brings the city
    of Tombouctu (top of screen) down to 8 population, and a Super Star Destroyer
    approaches the Malian coast. On the bridge, a commander questions whether or not
    they should begin the assault on the coastline. The Admiral straightens his moustache.
    'Garr, I have me orders from Emperor Morgan himself. He has something special
    planned for ‘em - we only be needin‘ to keep ‘em from escapin'.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene38.jpg
  narration: Jalalabad is captured by Vietnam once again and looks set to stay that
    way. A large contingent of Vietnamese paratroopers drop in around Kandahar, effectively
    bypassing the awkward Himalayan terrain and posing a serious threat to the Afghan
    core.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene39.jpg
  narration: "The revived peoples of the Sioux nation deploy their first military
    unit - a Longswordsman - allowing them to put up as much resistance as wet paper
    bag if any one of their neighbours were to declare war on them. \nThe World Congress
    decides that Finland and Ethiopia should be punished for their war crimes, and
    place embargoes on both nations. Although this is unlikely to have much of an
    economic impact on either of them, they should hope that this is not an early
    indication of greater conflict - particularly Ethiopia, with its proximity to
    the world‘s most dangerous military force."
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene40.jpg
  narration: Military presence in Ethiopia‘s newly-acquired north African territories
    is looking worryingly thin. If the Boers were to declare war right now they would
    cut through Ethiopia like a giant death robot through butter.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene41.jpg
  narration: To the south, more Buccaneer atomic bombs are dropped on the Mali capital
    of Nyeni, and the first infantry units make landfall on the coast. Previously
    Nyeni had a population of 28, which leads me to believe that two atom bombs have
    been used on the city since we last saw it.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene42.jpg
  narration: While nuclear war breaks out on their doorstep, the Boers still find
    time to complete the Orbital Refinery wonder. Not only does this grant them +2
    production from every factory and nanomaterial plant in the empire, it also provides
    12 nanomaterials for even more of those Future Worlds units. This could prove
    to be a vital investment for the Boers, who had begun to fall way behind the Inuit,
    Sibir and Australia in terms of production output.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene43.jpg
  narration: Both Peshawar and Kandahar (Afghanistan) are brought into the yellow
    by Vietnamese paratroopers. Afghan forces are starting to look incredibly thin
    on the ground.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene44.jpg
  narration: Back in Europe, Sweden enters the information era and has made a respectable
    semi-carpet. Still, there is a stark contrast in technology levels between them
    and their neighbour, Finland. Gustavus Adolphus (Sweden) may want to think twice
    before acting on either of his earlier plans to invade France or Sparta - those
    warmonger penalties could trigger a Finnish invasion.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene45.jpg
  narration: Communications arrays and power armor infantry litter the Inuit countryside,
    highlighting the technology gap between them and the increasingly outdated Canada.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene46.jpg
  narration: The assault on Mali continues as the Buccaneers drop yet another atomic
    bomb, this time on the city of Ka-Ba.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene47.jpg
  narration: Sejong (Korea) joins Gustavus (Sweden) in plotting against the stunted
    state of France, while a lone Portuguese privateer attempts to retake Funchal
    from the Buccaneers. Will they succeed? No, of course they won’t.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene48.jpg
  narration: The last Portuguese Nau, with no purpose or mission surveys a sizeable
    - but seriously outdated - Spartan navy. If Sparta was to attack Ethiopia right
    now they may be able to make some major gains - but at the price of bringing them
    closer to the formidable Boer war machine.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene49.jpg
  narration: The Australian forces just can‘t catch a break, and have yet to take
    a single Buccaneer city despite dealing heavy damage to Tulum, Corihuayrachina,
    and Vitcos. All three of these cities have suffered population loss, but this
    appears to be from starvation as opposed to flipping.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene50.jpg
  narration: Despite their impressive performance in the Pacific theatre, the Australian
    lag in technology is really starting to show. You‘re not going to win wars with
    caravels and musketmen anymore, Parkes.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene51.jpg
  narration: The Kimberley have done an impressive job of rebuilding their navy, but
    to what end? Surely it‘s only a matter of time until Australia or Vietnam put
    them out of their misery.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene52.jpg
  narration: Henry Morgan (Buccaneers) drops yet another atom bomb on the Mali capital
    of Nyeni, causing substantial damage to the enemy army in the process. The Buccaneer
    navy moves in for the kill, but don‘t seem to have brought along many land units
    capable of taking the fight inland. Morgan has also managed to secure a peace
    treaty with Korea, in spite of - or perhaps as a result of - earning a reputation
    as one of the most nuke-obsessed warlords in the world.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene53.jpg
  narration: The Buccaneer‘s European holdings look to be very thinly defended, however.
    Luckily for them the only civs in this region are very weak and/or sleepy. In
    the mediterranean, our intrepid Portuguese privateer appears to have been destroyed.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene54.jpg
  narration: Kandahar is brought down to the red and looks ready to be taken. The
    loss of this city will be a severe blow to Afghanistan, placing Vietnam in striking
    distance of their capital, Kabul.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene55.jpg
  narration: Buccaneer coastal cities continue to hold against the Wobbegong assault,
    although their South American inland holdings are very sparsely militarised. With
    their majority of their navy distracted by Australia to the west and Mali to the
    east, this could be a prime opportunity for Brazil to strike back.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene56.jpg
  narration: Instead, Pedro II (Brazil) makes peace with Mexico and goes to war with
    Texas. Canada joins in, but looks poorly equipped to take the city of Houston.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene57.jpg
  narration: In this corner of the Boer empire alone I count no less than five GDRs.
    Although Paul Kruger‘s war on piracy has been purely symbolic so far, if the Buccaneers
    start taking nearby Mali cities this could be enough to stir them into action.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene58.jpg
  narration: As expected, Kandahar falls to the Vietnamese paratroopers, and Afghanistan
    has very few melee units in the area to reclaim it.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: Image 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene59.jpg
  narration: The Buccaneers are just playing with Mali now, as they drop a fifth atom
    bomb on Yeji. The remaining population must survive by eating dangerously irradiated
    olives from the local plantations.
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: Image 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene60.jpg
  narration: One of our spies reports in from Hanoi. It appears the scattered remnants
    of Mao Zedong‘s (China) army are attempting to spread anti-Vietnamese sentiment
    across Sibir. The Trung Sisters (Vietnam) plot to remove the red army from the
    world once and for all, before Mao can turn Sibir against them.
- scene_number: "61"
  scene_title: Image 61
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene61.jpg
  narration: In one of the most tragic screenshots I‘ve ever seen, a single damaged
    Maori submarine and its cold, nationless crew sit beneath the arctic ice sheets.
    With no hope of repair, and less chance of sniping a city than even the Last Legion,
    they silently await their death. The Inuit Ice Sheet Fleet is truly terrifying
    - if only it could move somewhere useful.
- scene_number: "62"
  scene_title: Image 62
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene62.jpg
  narration: France proudly announces to the world that it has entered the modern
    era. With five whole battalions of Great War Infantry, they are ready to take
    on any and all would-be invaders.
- scene_number: "63"
  scene_title: Image 63
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part50-scene63.jpg
  narration: Here we see New Finland graciously playing host to visitors from Sri
    Lanka and Afghanistan. They‘ve even temporarily painted some of their cities in
    olive green and red to make them feel more at home.

  narration: The number of Boer and Finnish units in Yakutia is just ridiculous. The
    lack of space must be making it virtually impossible for Yakutia to coordinate
    any kind of attack or defence against their enemies.

  narration: In an effort to manipulate events in Oceania, the Inuit declare war on
    the greatly diminished nation of Kimberley.

  narration: The Inuit ploy immediately takes effect. Sensing a chance to gain favour
    with one of the world‘s major powers, a team of Champan lancers also declare war
    on the Kimberley.

  narration: Morgan, pls stahp. The relentless Buccaneer assault on Mali continues
    as atom bomb number six falls on Gao, and Bamako and Yeji enter the red. If my
    calculations are correct, somewhere in the region of 21.5 million innocent civilians
    have been killed by nuclear blasts in this war so far. Surely there will be some
    major repercussions against the Buccaneers for this?

  narration: After years of fighting, Australia finally takes the island city of Tulum
    from the Buccaneers. If they can hold it, this could be a useful base of operations
    for further attacks on the South and Central American coast. If they can make
    it as far as Nassau (the BR equivalent to the real-world Panama Canal), Australia
    could begin to extend the reach of its navy beyond the Pacific.

  narration: Both Yakutia and - closer to home - Sri Lanka, declare war on the Kimberley.
    Shots are already fired between Sri Lankan and Kimberley forces, and Denpasar
    (Kimberley) is taken into the yellow.

  narration: Sri Lankan forces engage the Kimberley Antarctic settlements, but the
    Kimberley seem to have enough naval strength in the area to hold off the attack.
    In other news, Afghanistan makes peace with Canada, deciding they have bigger,
    more Vietnamese problems to worry about.

  narration: |-
    A Buccaneer infantry unit captures Yeji from Mali, and at some point yet another atom bomb appears to have been dropped on Ka-Ba. In one of the most shrewd diplomatic moves to date, Henry Morgan (Buccaneers) decides this is the perfect time to negotiate a peace treaty with the Boers. This means they can continue to nuke and capture their way through Africa without having to worry about a Boer declaration of war for the immediate future. You sly dog, Morgan.
    Finland also declares war on Chile, although his motives for doing so are not immediately clear. I have no doubt that it‘s all part of the Kekk‘s master plan.

  narration: Hearing that nuclear war is all the rage nowadays, Gustavus Adolphus
    (Sweden) decides to construct some of his own shiny new atomic bombs. It‘s unclear
    yet whether these are destined for Sparta, France, or perhaps purely to act as
    a deterrent to the more powerful neighbouring nations of Iceland and Finland.

  narration: Sibir develops an impressive carpet to rival even the Fins, and Sejong
    plots against Persia. Mad with power from their latest conquests, the Trung Sisters
    (Vietnam) seek to find a way to bring Osei Tutu I (Ashanti) back to life just
    so they can kill him again.

  narration: Looking back at our spy‘s reports for this part, it‘s encouraging to
    see that some of the world‘s current powers are doing everything they can to take
    down the greatest threats of our age - many of which don‘t even own any cities.

  narration: Recruits Em, Ishtar and Semiramis receive their new orders and board
    the next flights to Santiago de Chile (Chile), Jokuskai (Yakutia) and Colombo
    (Sri Lanka) respectively. I’d love to know what’s going through Trigger Darkhan’s
    (Yakutia) mind as his once-mighty empire plays host to the combined armies of
    the Boers and Finland.

  narration: Catholicism and Judaism continue to hold the top two spots for religious
    influence, and it‘s good to see that Islam is holding strong in Dvin at the end
    of this part - the Party Prophet’s sacrifice was not in vain.

  narration: |-
    The religion map shows us that Catholicism and Buddhism are the only two religions with potential to naturally expand to atheistic cities in South America and Oceania, respectively.
    And that‘s all she wrote, folks! I hope you‘ve had as much fun reading this as I have writing it. It‘s 6am in my timezone and all these nukes have made me particularly sleepy, so until next time: Shine on Henry Morgan, you magnificent nuclear bastard.
