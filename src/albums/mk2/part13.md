  narration: "Hey there guys! My name is TPangolin, and it‘s an absolute honour have
    all of you on board to witness a battle of absolutely crazy proportions. What
    lies ahead is a battle that will last for millenia - over 60 Civilizations, both
    Firaxis and Fan-Made will battle it out on the largest Earth Map available. Some
    areas like Europe will be a hotspot of contention, where civs will have to brutally
    fight against each other in order to gain that vital early-game upper hand. Other
    areas on the globe are much more open, but are we sure these civs will make the
    most of what they‘re given? Join us on a journey bathed in blood, where one nation
    will hopefully become victorious over 60 of their lesser global neighbours. \nJoin
    us as we step into the madness that is the Official /r/civ 60+ A.I Battle Royale!"

  narration: Many thanks to u/SylonL for the latest map in a series of fantastic contributions
    towards this project. It’s definitely worth taking the time to examine the world
    in its current state, because the Wheel of Time ever spins onwards, and things
    will never be the same again...

  narration: "Feeling less than satisfied with the recent capture of Wahpekute (the
    Sioux city which boasts not only an important strategic bottleneck, but Petra),
    the battle-hardened Mexican generals press their leader to continue fighting,
    to quell the fact that the world had onced called their impressive green army
    ”The Siesta Fiesta”. Their leader (Benito Juarez), after scoping out potential
    targets fosters a deal with the Canadians to strike fear into the heart of the
    Texans, starting with a row of Catapults. \nHigh on syrup and subsequently life
    in general  - Lester B. Pearson of Canada (whom until their position of “Most
    Powerful Nation in the World” goes away, insists on being called Lester B. Fearsome)
    decides he legitimately has nothing to lose agrees to the Mexican Declaration
    of War. Perhaps someone should tell the Canadians that their position as the most
    feared and powerful nation is subject to criticism, seeing as they‘ve never actually
    successfully invaded anywhere before. People the world over may fear the Canadian
    Eh-Team, but Texans are no ordinary people and they know full well that a push
    towards the newly acquired Canadian city of Philadelphia is more than possible."

  narration: In the depths of his icy fortress, the ever-watchful and grand Nebuchadnezzar
    of Babylon ends his Appletini bender with a weary sigh. A Golden Age Party only
    comes around once every few millennia, and it‘s extremely hard to import Vodka
    from the Soviet Union without raising any suspicion from the watchful eyes of
    the Israelite Scouts affectionately nicknamed by Nebby himself as “The Cursed
    Jewluminati”.

  narration: As Mazar-i-Sharif falls once again into Sri Lankan hands, we see the
    vast hordes of the Yakutian Empire enjoying vast amounts of recreational time
    off, as was ordered by Royal Decree. Not too far behind Australia as the second
    Civilization to enter the Renaissance Era, Tygyn Darkhan declares that this is
    a time for celebration, not warfare. Both morally, and geographically the Yakutians
    think they above it all.

  narration: Meanwhile in the Pacific, an excited crew on a breakaway Caravel from
    the Australian Grand Wobbegong Armada break into the doors of the Captain‘s Quarters
    screaming “Struth Cappo! That dingo up in the mast thinks he may have spotted
    some land in the distance!”. The sourfaced bearded Captain gave an extremely elongated
    groan which can only be interpreted as “Coccio, it‘s 11AM on a bloody Sunday Morning
    - I‘m hungover as hell, and couldn‘t care less for what you yobbos are talking
    about”.

  narration: To the north, the Arctic contingent of the Inuit Ice Sheet Fleet lead
    by Hayreddin Barbarossa begins to siege the Sioux City of Mawhota. Further south,
    the Blackfoot-Inuit alliance is strengthened with the Inuit Council of Elders
    deciding to send their army to assist the diminishing numbers of the Blackfoot
    Foot Clan. Canada proves they have no idea what they are doing when it comes to
    warfare after Lester B. Fearsome decided to give his army a sampler of Maple Tequila
    (the new alcoholic beverage created to celebrate the joint declaration of war
    with Mexico against Texas).

  narration: |-
    Meanwhile in the Asian Theater, the Koreans send their Turtle Flotilla to prove that they too can slightly miff the Vietnamese. These non-important squabbles could actually be what saves the Filipinos from the capture of Cebu. It‘s not likely, but if I were Rizal (Philippines) I‘d be wanting to grasp at as many straws as I possibly could. In the Manila, the populace is starting to get uneasy, not only because of Rizal hoarding straws like it‘s a goddamn luxury resource, but because the Cham army seems poised to take Olongapo (Philippines). Tough times to be a Filipino.
    Meiji (Japan) watches in delight as the poor Filipinos struggle to understand why they can‘t have nice things. He watches on from his vacation house in Iloilo as he sips highest quality sake known to man - ‘God‘s Sake‘.

  narration: Meanwhile, a Sri Lankan Pytheas decides to lead the charge against Burma
    in the Siege of Mandalay Bay. It‘s not going too well, but if anyone needs an
    esteem booster in the form of a non-eventful war - it‘s the Sri Lankans. They
    just want to feel like building the Statue of Zeus in Colombo was actually worth
    it for them (it wasn‘t).

  narration: Under the leadership of Murat Reis (the legendary Barbary Corsair hired
    by Japan to fight a war halfway across the world) Cebu is crushed, captured and
    quarantined from any potential retakings by the nearby Manila Flotilla. With the
    Korean Navy blocking any potential recaptures, Meiji (Japan) can only revel in
    excitement. “Four God‘s Sake!” he screams to his assistant who eagerly tries to
    find four glasses to hold the high quality rice wine.

  narration: Whilst other civs may have merely settled and adopted Mountains, the
    Tibetans were born on them. The Tibetan Yak Pack (the army sent by Tibet to take
    Hoa Lu) effectively take potshots at the nearby Vietnamese City of Hao Lu. The
    Vietnamese is now learning the effectiveness of the Turtle strategy and what happens
    when their army is spread way too thin.

    Force (spuriously named “The Top Kekks”) fail to capture the Hunnic city of Morelia.
    The Soviets got there first, too late to make a good “Finnish him” pun.

  narration: |-
    The local warlords and kings struggle to maintain the foothold on their reigns down in Africa as the entire upper half of the continent is plunged into chaos. The Ayyubid strategy is perfect for feigning incompetence. As they have done before, the Ayyubids love to send small armies to cities (so they are not considered threats). Without thinking they need backup, the city owners hold down their respective forts only to be taken Chilean style up the backdoor by mounted Ayyubid units. Genius!
    Elsewhere, the Moroccan city of Tangier is in danger of flipping over to the Carthaginians and their former Ashanti colony of Mampong (Morocco) is under attack by the Kongolese.

  narration: Meiji (Japan), shouldn’t let his recent captures get to his head - there
    is a vast world out there filled with barbarous civilizations and barbarous thoughts.
    With the news that Yakutia is indeed plotting against Japan, us here on the Babylonian
    Submarine can only wryly smile for what could potentially be the awakening of
    the grand Yakutian snoreyaks.

  narration: Hoping to get their collective shit together in the form of a rucksack,
    the Canadian forces muster a coherent force to invade the Sioux with. Say what
    you want about Sitting Bull, he’s pretty good at defending himself in the face
    of a spooky amount of unnecessary adversity.

  narration: Meanwhile, Chile seems to be upgrading their military. Whether or not
    this is to help with their not-so-successful invasion of the Incan Empire or to
    prepare for a blitzkrieg on Argentina is yet to be seen. We’ll just have to wait
    and see for now.

    Cutting their losses and realising that Korea now has a pretty strong hold over Guangzhou (Korea), Mao strikes a deal with Sejong to end the fighting... For now.

  narration: In the midst of Siberia, the frosty John D. Rockefeller makes plans to
    revolutionize the fuel industry around the Siberian city of Sorgit! With this
    new revenue generator, perhaps the esteem of the Sibir people will motivate them
    enough to bolster the defences of Chimgi-Tura and finally capture the Hunnic city

    Portuguese who seems to have taken the crown off of Mexico for holding the worlds
    largest “Siesta Fiesta” - a celebration for a decently large military that loves

    to take the city of Austin has faltered once more. Deciding that perhaps they’ll
    convince the Texans via reason, not force - Benito Juarez sends a religious Delegate
    to Houston (thinking that’s where Texan leader Sam Houston lives) to try and get
    him to just hand over Austin because this whole process is just getting arduous
    and rather tiring.

  narration: Leonidas the Younger (Sparta) orders his Abwall Phalanx eastward to counter
    the threat of Armenian Citadel placements. With a solid strategy of using Pikemen
    as human meatshields, a simultaneous push towards both Varna and Tigranocerta
    (Armenia) seems more than likely. Meanwhile, the Spartan Navy (the Floating Phalanx)
    is under orders to be as diplomatically dickish as possible toward the Ayyubids.
    As they are not at war with Saladin (Ayyubids) the Spartans are forced to hold
    out and wait for the Armenians to capture the city before they have an excuse
    to capture it themselves. Leonidas loves working on these gains.

    No longer does Sri Lanka have an impressive carpet of units over the lower half

    Mandalay Bay or gain a slight one-uppance over Afghanistan by trying for Mazar-i-Sharif.

Peron (Argentina) encourages her citizens to not cry for Morgan. The truth is he never cared about diplomacy. Also he’s a dick.

    whilst the red menace is distracted by Hitler and an inevitable Spartan declaration
    of war. Stockholm also sits on a very decent population.\nIt also should be noted
    that Sweden has a new UA for this Battle Royale: \nInfantry Units produce Great
    Generals faster when beginning next to a friendly Mounted Unit. Great Generals
    increase the starting Movement of adjacent Siege Units by +1 and may be used to
    spread your religion.\nAfter hearing the tenets of Judaism, Hitler decides to

  narration: Due to the absence of the Religion Map last time, it’s time for a small
    intermission in this part! It’s worth noting that the Ayyubids have a unique ability
    which allows them to convert any captured city to their religion (which is why
    they have three Islamic cities). This means if they capture Addis Ababa (Holy
    City of Oriental Orthodoxy) or Jerusalem (Holy City of Judaism), they will lose
    their Holy City status and become Islamic.

    The good news for Philippines is that the assaults on Olongapo and Caloocan are starting to slowing down. With this in mind, Rizal (Philippines) begins to run around town helping everyone he can find to start building ships to reinforce their frontier cities.

    Once considered one of the weakest civilizations in the game, Korea is now rocketing through the tech tree to become the fourth civ to enter the Renaissance era. The Turtle Flotilla also can now live up to their name by building Turtle Ships! These could be potentially amazing what with their strength of 36 (compared to the caravels 20)
    Hellooo coastal conquests!

    Another shot of South America, where although armies are in place to capture the cities of their enemies - they just can’t escape the funk that they’re in. For a continent where every civ is at war - we haven’t seen a single city capture. That’s crazy town banana pants.
    And yes, by now you’ve all read the top of the screen. If you’re a Canadian, the worst has happened. Condolences for the passing of thy dignity.

  narration: "Canada had the classic effect of speaking softly and carrying a big
    stick. Let’s not kid around, Canada had a massive stick. Their stick was the envy
    of the entire world. Delegates, Missionaries and Leaders the world over would
    read all the time about Canada’s massive stick and would travel there just to
    see the mighty stick itself. It was a marvellous stick.\nHowever Lester B. Fearsome
    got too cocky. He started speaking loudly and waving the fact that he had a massive
    stick around in the face of the Texans. Texans didn’t have time for this dicknishness
    and bit back. Canada has learnt that it‘s not about the size of your stick that
    counts, but how you use it. Canada now has a smaller stick, and a smaller empire.
    \nAnd a lot of time to think about what he’s done.\nAlso, Ashanti seem to have
    gotten wind that Sparta is plotting against them and decided to give them the
    diplomatic middle finger."

    The Pirates of the Caribbean start to attract the attention of others, as can be evidenced by Brazil declaring war on them. Mind you, a South American declaration of war is basically a denouncement. They have very fragile personas down in the cloudy continent.
    You’d think that Pedro II (Brazil) would at least get their exploratory triremes and scouts of Buccaneer territory before doing that though. Maybe he just forgot.

  narration: The White Walkers have proved to be firestarters by aiming to burning
    down as many Sioux cities as possible. Although Itazipcho was recaptured by the
    Sioux, I can’t imagine that the Inuit would be too worried at all about all of
    this. Canada may actually have a chance to capture the Sioux city now.

    Rizal leads his Manila Flotilla against the tyrannous Japanese in a rebellion, which ends in the successful capture of Caloocan!
    Meanwhile, the Cham declares that it’s not too worth it to take potshots at their south east Asian neighbour for now as they make peace with Rizal (presumably to bolster and upgrade their army).
    Burma hold the line against a potential Vietnamese invasion around Bago.
    The Inuit prove that they are the embodiment of the phrase “IGDAF” and burn down the Sioux city they let them recapture. Maybe this is all just an elaborate form of psychological fuckery towards Canada and the Sioux (who both really want the city).

    Varna (Armenia) is subject to the combined assault by the Eastern Abwall and Floating Phalanxes, while to the west Ravenna (Rome) looks sure to fall to the Spartans likewise.
    Whilst at the beginning of the game, people thought that Sparta would be faltering and squashed - at this point they are winning a war on two fronts and seem to be championing middle-out compression.

    The Top Kekks continue their heavy handed reconnaissance into Hunnic territory. They don’t seem to keen on capturing Atilla’s court, but Finnish do like to wave around their big stick. Finland also decides to take a shot at settling more tundra cities with the erection of the city of Joensuu.
    The Huns also look poised to capture Chimgi-Tura (but who are we kidding, they’ve looked that way for ages).

    - Portugal declares peace with Kongo and hands over the city of Braga to the Kongo
    in a goddamn peace deal! I was having a hard time remembering that they were even
    at war. \nOh man... I cannot wait for the next edition of the Lazy Portugal Show.
    This just writes itself...\nAs a sidenote, I was hovering over Portugal at the
    time that this happened and spit apple cider all over my screen. Then I had to
    Google how to clean apple cider off of my screen so that was fun."

    Meanwhile, in the Caribbean, The Buccaneers have another foe in the form of Argentina. The War on Piracy as was masterminded by Argentina and Brazil could be potentially interesting with Brazil sending many small fleets to capture the smaller islands of Nevis and Florida Keys (Buccaneers).
    I bet Henry Morgan just can’t wait to get his hands on Parana (Argentina).

  narration: Thus we come to our close, as can be evidenced by the fact that I have
    just mentioned that we are coming to a close. In our first Info Addict slide,
    we see that Canada sits at the top of the crop with their top pop slot. A notable
    inclusions in the top 10 include the Maori, who seem to have taken the concept
    of “mateship” to a whole new level.

  narration: In terms of Land Area, the Inuit are in to winnuit, topping the list

  narration: Predictably, Rome sits on the bottom of our list. It’ll be interesting
    to see if they’re the first to go though. The city of Rome seems to be a hard
    nut to crack, and other civs (although they have more cities) have the potential
    to be cut like butter.

    In terms of tech, Colonialist Legacies civs take up 8/10 of them (Woo, represent!). As we’re only heading into the Renaissance era now, we’ll start to be seeing a massive shift in these tech leads as other smaller (but higher pop) cities gain access to Universities which can rocket them through the rankings.
    Also keep in mind that number of technologies =/= era progress. Korea is one of the four civs in the Renaissance but fails to make an entrance in the top 12.

    also couldn’t care less about scientific advancement! Also note that Carthage,
    whose conquests are notable and hordes of elephants are impressive has an extremely
