  narration: Hello, and welcome back to the Civ V Battle Royale!  I’m your narrator
    today, /u/The_EnigmaConundrum.  Big thanks to TPang for letting me do this short-notice
    part.  Now, let’s get right into the recap!
- scene_number: "2"
  scene_title: 2
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene02.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The power rankings this time show that the Inuit have the number 1 slot
    in their cold, dead hands, and have tightened their grip to be colder and… deader.  We’ll
    see if they hold this position, or if it’s temporary.
- scene_number: "3"

  narration: Here is the map from last time, notably showing the flip of some Boer
    holdings, as well as the Inuit advance into Yakutia.  Carthage has been lost to
    Iceland, Kumasi to the Buccaneers, and the Ice Man Cometh into Yakutia.

  narration: Here, we have a population density map from part 72!  Noticeably, population
    is very low in West and North Africa, most likely due to the sheer amount of city
    flips.  On the same continent happen to be the highest population cities, naturally
    including M’banza-Kongo.  Most of eastern Finland and western Sibir are still
    recovering their populations from their war a few parts ago, and Mexico has lost
    most of its population from Australia and the Buccs. Now, onto the relationships
    chart!

  scene_title: 5
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene05.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here we see the remaining members of the OCP, containing Iceland, Brazil,
    Vietnam, and Ethiopia still at war with the Boers.  We also see the Anti-Japan
    Coalition, with the members that can do nothing in the war, and the Kimberley.  Some
    other miscellaneous wars, like Armenia vs Israel, and Sweden is still trying to
    take Dvin.  Hasn’t SirMallock suffered enough?
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: 6
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene06.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here we see a shot of Messina and Loango, one Boer island city and another
    a formerly Kongolese city.  These two cities are surrounded by embarked Boers,
    or Boer units.  They are closer to the Boer core, so they’re probably going to
    stay orange.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: 7
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene07.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Now, here is Harrismith, another Boer settlement!  Being a one tile island,
    it isn’t highly sought after by any of the Boer’s current enemies.  It still has
    a Hovertank, Historical Caravel and some of the Boer fleet surrounding it, however.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene08.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here we get a shot of what’s left of Etharabia.  Notably, the Boers now
    own Mecca, putting another capital under their control.  Bethlehem, Damascus,
    and Najran are all in the red, so they could flip soon.If you look to the north,
    Gaza is in the yellow, spelling trouble for David.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene09.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    Brazil has made peace with the Boers!  Only briefly flipping a city, they weren’t much use in this war, but they did more than Sibir.  Vietnam seems to be somewhat inactive against the Boers, leaving this war mainly to the Buccs and Iceland.
    With this peace treaty we also have a nice shot of the Brazilian core, which is well defended by their carpet, also happening to be one of the mostly intact carpets (looking at you Kruger, Kekkonen, Kuchum).
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene10.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: My F key is now primed, as Gaza is in the yellow, and has three Armenian
    paratroopers next to it, as well as Tiridates’ reinforcements a little bit north
    of Gaza.  We may witness Israel’s second death soon.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene11.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Genghis is trying to take Khonuu for Mongolia, but with little luck.  He’s
    using helicopters on cities, which doesn’t work.  The Horribly Slow Conqueror
    with an Extremely Inefficient Army needs another type of unit.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene12.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Finnish core is somewhat sparse, lacking a large amount of units.  I
    guess when you’re not at war with anyone you can go relax in the sauna instead
    of carpeting.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene13.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Inuit definitely have the upper hand here, having flipped two border
    cities and having XCOMs and GDRs ready to fight the Yakuts.  Time will only tell
    if they continue to take cities.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene14.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Genghis has gotten a modern armor next to Khonuu!  Mongolia can now capture
    the city from Darkhan, if the modern armor doesn’t get killed first.  We will
    see.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene15.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: 'A shot of the Siberian core shows them to have almost no carpet!  Fun
    fact: there are more workers than units here.  Carpeting 101 here.  Always have
    less units defending than you do civilians.'
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene16.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Buccaneers make more gains as they take Nuevitas and Carthago Nova.  They
    may revive part of Arrrrrrrrrrrrfrica, but not the whole thing.  That much land
    it lost to the Boerg now.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene17.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: It’s happened everybody.  Israel is dead.  Starting in a crowded region,
    with the Ayyubids, Arabia, and Armenia, David didn’t have much of a chance to
    expand.  They died about 30 parts ago, and being revived in part 63 with an awful
    city left them in an awful position, and Ethiopia citadeling them didn’t help.  They
    did found the religion most of Europe and part of Central Asia follows though,
    so that’s a plus for them.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene18.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: We can see the last two Jewish missionaries, and a defended inquisitor
    in Etharabia.  The missionaries will likely will spread Judaism and fade, but
    the inquisitor can’t be used.  If he does get used, which he is unable to be used,
    then we’re in for a shock, because Israel was then revived.  Nobody expects the
    Jewish inquisition!
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene19.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Okay, the Boerg are angry.  They have two nukes right outside Kumasi,
    and may use them.  You can hear their army chanting “YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED”
    at the pirates, all the way from Dvin.  Resistance is indeed futile.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene20.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: A second slide showing Kumasi, but without any display there.  It doesn’t
    look good, especially with a nuclear threat outside of it.  With a small amount
    of land surrounding it that isn‘t Boer, it won‘t be very useful to the Buccs,
    if it weren‘t a capital.  The old Ashanti land is one of the things that made
    this a worthwhile capture.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene21.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Korean core has less units, but high-tech units.  They have Robot
    Infantry next to Jokusai, and Finnish PEACEKEEPERS (definitely not ready to snipe
    a city) near Hiroshima, ready to make more bordergore.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene22.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Boer core has a large navy near it, and many paratroopers needing
    an upgrade, as well as a Great Musician.  What would Boer music sound like?  Being
    basically cyborgs at this point, would dubstep be almost like classical to them?  An
    older form of music using earlier versions of the same tools?
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene23.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here we see Iceland’s core, with an armada full of empty carriers and
    cybersubs.  Is that a Swedish privateer?  Seriously Gustavus, you need to upgrade!  Any
    major power could beat that!  The AI always has a massive stash of gold.  Well,
    here’s somewhere to use it.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene24.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here we see Iceland’s core, with an armada full of empty carriers and
    cybersubs.  Is that a Swedish privateer?  Seriously Gustavus, you need to upgrade!  Any
    major power could beat that!  The AI always has a massive stash of gold.  Well,
    here’s somewhere to use it.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene25.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: In this image taken from a low-budget Buccaneer Biodrone (made from Boer
    scraps, a polaroid camera and ducttape) The Boers are sending a GDR to take Basse-Terre
    back from Henry Morgan.  The Buccs will probably take it back.  It’s just been
    like Straya-Vietnam with lots of flips with no large changes in the end.  Also,
    in the bottom-left corner, you can see the comms within the Babylonian submarine.  Two
    hours to what?  The arrival of the Shooting Star?
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene26.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Yakutia has taken Russkoye Ustye from Ekeuhnick!  Trigger Darkhan is
    going to rap to commemorate his victory.  Hopefully he finishes it before the
    Inuit take it back.  But then he can reuse it when the Yakuts probably flip it
    again.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene27.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Genghis has done it!  He took Khonuu!  That one modern armor made it
    and now it is his!  The Horribly Slow Conqueror just made a gain!  Happy times
    for all of Mongolia.  I guess that‘s why you don‘t fight the Mongols when you
    have a Great Wall.  Even if it is obsolete, they still always get through it.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene28.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here are the ruins of a city, which belongs to Finland now, and only
    that tile.  It’s miniature bordergore!  Kekkonen can’t even stop the bordergore
    when he tries.  Also, the Siberian Worker Battalion and the Finnish Worker Corps
    seem to be ready to fight.  Which Civ can build enough roads in each other’s territory
    to try and screw their economy?
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene29.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Holy crap that’s a lot of nukes.  Iceland seems to be serious about winning
    against the Boers.  Nukes won’t do much to the already incredibly irradiated Boer
    lands, but he can try.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene30.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: In Cork, Ingolfur has jet fighters instead of nukes, but still enough
    of an air force to damage some Boer cities.  Maybe Iceland will hold more than
    Carthage and Olympia now.  Maybe.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene31.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Another wing of the Icelandic Nuclear force is in Lyon, much closer to
    the Boers.  This and the Reykjavik nukes could put a serious dent in the northern
    Boer holdings.  Iceland is hoarding nukes like the Indian nuclear warlord we all
    know of from this game series (not the BR) who I will not name.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene32.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Boers took Nuevitas back and his army is approaching the Bucc cities
    in the red, including Rabat, Marrakech, Basse-Terre, Ciudad Del Carmen, and Bamako.  These
    cities could easily be flipped by the CyberBoers if Kruger put in more of an effort.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene33.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The unexpected inquisitor is seeking sanctuary in Jericho.  Good choice
    David.  Every other Ethiopian city is in the red but Jericho is undamaged.  He
    may be safe there.  Or the Boers will march around it for a few days, playing
    the aforementioned futuristic dubstep until the walls fall.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene34.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Now we see that Sibir has units close enough to take Kabul, Afghanistan
    should be worried.  Once Kabul is Siberian, it’s a perfect doorway into the rest
    of Afghanistan.  This could be all Kuchum needs to defeat Hotak.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene35.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Boers have reclaimed Utique and Carthago Nova from Morgan!  This
    is a small push on the Buccs.  Gades is also soon to fall, and with MARINES (Great
    job Buccs, way to stay on top of the tech game), they aren’t likely to take either
    city back.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene36.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: A Mobile SAM is now embarked to take Sale from the Buccaneers.  A Hovertank
    has weakened the city, but the Mobile SAM could take it.  Let’s see if this happens
    soon.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene37.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Yakuts have a rocket artillery weakening their old city of Khonuu.  It’s
    in the red so we could see a flip yet again.  In other words, not much happening
    except population getting lowered.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene38.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here is the strategic view of the Northern part of Sibir, Mongolia, and
    Yakutia.  Yakutia has the most fallout, with Mongolia in second, and Sibir doing
    the best on having clear land.  Just nuclear fallout everywhere in the Russian
    tundra.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene39.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here we see the incredibly nuked Yakutian-Inuit border.  It seems that
    the Inuit did use that nuclear missile we saw earlier.  The first of many, it
    seems.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene40.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Moroccan musketman is heading for Vietnam, after too much time trapped
    with the Boers.  Maybe they’ll get trapped in the Vietnamese carpet as opposed
    to Kruger’s carpet.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene41.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Khonuu has been flipped back to brown and blue.  Genghis has still made
    no headway here, so he’s back to being the Horribly Slow Conqueror.  He did seem
    to lose the helicopters for cities, so that’s a plus.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene42.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The single Kimberley missile cruiser near Osaka is nearly dead.  I guess
    Jandamarra won’t kill Meiji yet.  Korea’s favorite animes won’t get cancelled
    just yet.  There was much rejoicing in Seoul.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene43.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Kimberley Indonesia has enough of a navy to take Osaka if they want to,
    so why aren’t they?  The AI at its best, folks.  Carpeting over fighting.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene44.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Iceland has a Stealth Bomber in Sparta.  Sparta also has zero health,
    all that is needed is any Boer unit nearby.  Unfortunately, there’s absolutely
    no Boer units nearby.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene45.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here’s strategic view, showing the almost-dead Osaka, in the red.  There’s
    also a backup Kimberley missile cruiser, highlighted by TPang.  Even if the first
    one dies, Jandamarra can still finish off Japan.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene46.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    It seems Russkoye Ustye has flipped back to being Inuit.  Darkhan is no longer rapping, but he something much more solemn for this loss.
    Is this the real life…
    Is this just fantasy…
    Caught in a warzone…
    Escape from Russkoye Ustye...
    However, Ekeuhnick needs to step up his game to make more advances into Yakutia.  Brazil’s peacekeepers are also getting in the way, so Pedro is partially causing such a stagnant war.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene47.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Here’s a reflipped Khonuu, back to Genghis, with more helicopters, of
    course!  He just can’t stop trying to capture cities with units unable to capture
    cities.  A Mobile SAM did the job though, so it doesn’t matter.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene48.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Our first major shot of Mexico, or basically Fallout 5 at this point.  They’ve
    both been nuked enough to count.  Ciudad Juarez  and Monterrey are in the red,
    making them easy targets for Buccs and Strayans alike.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene49.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Boers seem to have 4 drone fighters within proximity of Olympia and
    Gades.  Maybe that’s why the cities are always so low on health.  Hippo Regius
    has no health and an Icelandic unit nearby, ready to claim their first inland
    African city.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene50.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Carthago Nova and Nuevitas have both flipped back to black.  The Buccs
    have reclaimed the two frequently flipping cities.  By Kruger’s turn, they’ll
    probably flip back again based on the way this part has been.
- scene_number: "51"

  narration: Here is the victory progress menu!  All other victories are disabled,
    obviously, but the domination progress is quite complex.  However, Iceland is
    the current winner, controlling 7 capitals.  We will see how the Boer wars here
    change this, as Kruger controls multiple capitals.  M’Banza-Kongo, Mecca, Nyeni,
    Ulundi, Cairo, and Pretoria are all somewhat possible captures by Iceland, Vietnam,
    and the Buccaneers.

  narration: Another shot of the Boerg Armada, stationed near Umgungundlovu and Nongoma,
    mostly.  Also here is a very lost member of the Wobbegong, as well as the Persian
    Privateer.  Maybe Kruger will trap him, wanting a replacement Ashanti pikeman.  Nothing
    can replace Osei, but the Boers can try.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene53.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: I didn’t mention this earlier because of the death of Israel, but Ekeuhnick
    is plotting against the Persian Privateer.  He’d have to go a long way and through
    the Boermuda Triangle known as the Boerg Armada.  That’d be about as useful as
    the Boers killing the Last Legion, as listed here.  The only thing of note here
    is a possible Boer-Mongol war.

  narration: The grand spymaster TPangolin shuffles his spies, with Em in Kandahar,
    Ishtar in Osaka, and Semiramis in Ciudad Juarez.  I feel that at least one of
    them will be fleeing their city soon.
- scene_number: "55"

  narration: Henry Morgan tires of the sea and builds a vertol!  This could be a problem
    for Benito, as Vertols have 80 attack strength and also happens to be faster.  It
    is a helicopter unit, so no city captures, but it is a little stronger.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part73-scene56.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Iceland also has Railgun Armor in Boer lands!  Only slightly stronger
    than Modern Armor, however, it’s easily positioned to take either Hippo Regius
    or Kongo Dia Nlaza.
- scene_number: "57"

  narration: The unexpected inquisitor is wandering towards Gaza, hoping to maybe
    take it back with the crossbows.  That isn’t how it works David, don’t try.  Stay

  narration: With no flips in this area, the thing of note is the UN meeting in 5
    turns.  They’re trying to pass Judaism as a World Religion and an embargo on the
    Mongols.  I don’t think the former will pass, but I doubt anyone in, say, the
    Americas, really cares about the Mongols.

  narration: Damascus was just nuked off the map, apparently.  Ah well.  Najran looks
    likely to fall soon, especially with a Boer GDR nearby.  This only leaves Etharabia
    with Jericho, partially surrounded with Hawaiian peacekeepers.  Also, is that
    a Hawaiian marine I see near Najran?  WIll they snipe a city?

  narration: Here is the strategic view shot of the same region, with the fallout
    surrounding the land that used to be Damascus.  Baalbek and Cairo seem to have
    also been hit pretty hard by nukes, showing the Boers have quite the recovery
    stage coming.

    nicely.  It seems Japan will survive another day, keeping Korea quite happy.

  narration: Here is a shot of Strayan Philippines, with the Kimberley military passing
    through.  I may have to eat my words on the last slide, as Jandamarra is sending
    his real army through to attack.  This may be worse for Japan than Yakutia’s brief
    Khanquest of Osaka.

  narration: Nedong is doing somewhat well, at a population of 4, with Siberian workers,
    Armenian infantry, two cannons, and a Finnish caravan passing through.  Unless
    Tiri wants more land from fellow rump states, this should be relatively fine.

  narration: IF THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT LEG DAY, THEN THEY WILL NOT LIVE!  Seriously
    though, Sparta can build nukes now.  We may get another blaze of glory like Texas
    or the Maori.  Weapons other than the abwall soldiers will bode quite well for
    Leonidas.

  narration: Here’s the Yakut-Sibir border, and oh god.  Are those ARTILLERY I see
    around Turinsk?  Seriously Kuchum, you’re nearly as bad as the Boers on upgrading!  That’s
    just awful.  Industrial era weapons don’t work with Future Worlds weapons.

  narration: The Bucc naval carpet is quite solid, with TPang highlighting that they
    have Mutants!  Also, next to the Mutant is a Great merchant.  Henry Morgan seems
    to be trying to bring back Bring Your Merchant to War Day from the beginning of
    Mk II.

  narration: A Boer nuke is close enough to nuke the Bucc fleet, slowing them down,
    possibly allowing the Boers to retake these cities.  However, there are a couple
    of Icelandic ships to the south of the Bucc fleet, acting as backup.

  narration: Iceland seems to have a solid hold on Olympia, they’ll probably hold
    it.  Carthago Nova is low on health, meaning it could flip soon, especially with
    a Boer GDR nearby it.

  narration: Carthago Nova and Utique are in the black, and not a Boer melee unit
    in sight!  I’d focus on that, but the Roman Bucc holding are being damaged, but
    probably will not be taken, as well as Sparta.  It seems there are more workers
    than there are Boer units that can capture cities here.

  narration: Jericho is now in the black, and the Boers have a Chimera next to it.  Etharabia
    may fall soon, or it may not.  As far as we know, Najran is still alive, so Selassie
    is still safe.

  narration: The Boers have Rabat and Nuevitas back, and Bamako is in the black, also
    without any unit capable of taking cities.  Great job Kruger, you are a good strategist.  Nope,
    this is horrible.

  narration: Kruger had himself flown out to Harrismith, just to say goodbye to Osei
    Tutu one last time.  The pikeman is leaving Africa to explore the world.  Apparently
    the Ashanti have Astronomy, as they are leaving.  Maybe they will meet the Burmese
    musician soon.  Maybe they will find a new land, greater than ever.  Either way,
    all of the Boers are sad to see their medieval friends go.

  narration: Ciudad Juarez could be taken at any time, it’s just when Morgan gets
    there with one of those units from Guadalajara.  Torreon has been retaken from
    the Aussies as well, only leaving Parkes with Baja California.

  narration: Here are two Inuit nukes near Kamchatka.  Presumably going to aid the
    Yakut border conflict, these bombs will further irradiate the already inhospitable
    lands.  It’s like if Hiroshima and Chernobyl had a massive child.

  narration: Here we get a shot of the Bucc-Brazil border, with the incredibly sparse
    Bucc lands, and the heavily carpeted Brazilian land.  Pedro could unify South
    America if he chose to, but due to diplomatic modifiers from the OCP, this wouldn’t
    happen right now.  Shame.  I was almost ready to see the GCP shitposts.

  narration: The Boers must have finished their sixth day of marching around it, because
    Jericho has almost fallen.  The Hawaiian great general is here, increasing my
    hope for a snipe by Kamehameha.

  narration: "A capital has been lost.  Before anyone posts about “which capital was
    lost,” I checked the minimap, and it was Kabul.  Sibir has taken Kabul.  I fear
    Afghanistan will fall shortly after this, as this is a gateway into the rest of
    the “graveyard of Empires” (not Dvin, the other one). \nAlso, the Boer lands are
    irradiated  beyond hope at this point.  Even if they had a worker carpet to rival
    Sibir, it’d still take forever to restore their population."

  narration: Etharabia has really buffed up its defenses of Najran, so even if they
    lose Jericho, they still have one city that could hold out for a turn or two.  Only
    time will tell.

  narration: Another slide on Mongolia and Yakutia!  With Khonuu somewhat in his grasp,
    Genghis will keep one city from this part at least.  He also seems to be going
    on the offensive to attack Darkhan.

  narration: Here’s a shot of Borkholm, apparently with drone fighters and mech artillery.  There’s
    a small delegation from the Swedish Armada here, ready to fight.  They won’t fight
    for a little while, as they’d have to go all the way to Dvin, through the hellzone
    that is the Buccaneer Mediterranean and Boer north Africa.  For now, they stay
    near Helsinki, bothering Top Kek.

  narration: InfoAddict slides!  Australia is number one in military, surpassing Vietnam
    by a decently large amount.  Iceland has the Boers beat at number 4, and the Buccs
    are out of the top ten, placing at 11.

  narration: Australia is still number one in land area, because they haven’t had
    any major gains or losses in a while.  The Boers follow at number two with only
    two-thirds the amount Straya has.  It’s close from there, with the Inuit about
    the same size, with the Buccs disproportionately lower, and it keeps going from
    there.

  narration: The Inuit still lead in the city count, closely followed by Australia.  The
    Boers are catching them however, with 93 cities.  Australia has 103 and the Inuit
    105, so someone is catching up to the leaders of the city number board for a long
    time.

  narration: The low side of the city count is Mongolia, with 13 cities.  After that
    is the Kimberley and Mexico with 10, and from there is our rump states!  Sri Lanka
    has 4, Armenia 3 (RIP Israel), Tibet 2, Ethiopia 2, Afghanistan 2, and Texas,
    Japan, Dvin, and Hawaii at 1 city.

  narration: Within religions, Catholicism has 196 cities, leaving them as the leaders.  Judaism
    is 49 cities lower at 147, Oriental Orthodoxy still mostly belongs to Africa with
    103 followers, and the numbers just keep going down until Islam, with 6 followers
    in the whole world.  The Party Prophet is more legend to the inhabitants of this
    world, having been long dead from liver failure.  Few still follow his teachings.

    We end things off with the religion map, showing the same thing as usual, but with one twist- religion is getting nuked and flipped out of some cities, notably ex-Arrrrrrrrfrican cities and some Asian cities.
    This has been an interesting part, and we hope that all of you enjoyed it.  This has been /u/The_EnigmaConundrum and I wish you all a great day!
