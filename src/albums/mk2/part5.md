      The state of the world, 2740 B.C., presented in a ravishing limited edition
      folio by SylonL. Reserve your copy today by clicking on it and downloading it.
      And printing it. And then laminating it. With your laminator. Since all possible
      religions have already been founded, what do we think ‘B.C.’ stands for? I humbly
      submit ‘Ben Coccio’ as an option. No reason. I just like the sound of it. You
      know, unless you guys think of something better.

    narration:
      "In 2740 B.C., just north of here in China, a book of military strategy
      and tactics is written by The Guy Who Won All Those Wars. It’s called How to Fight
      Wars Good. AS you can imagine, it’s an instant worldwide bestseller. \nChé Bông
      Nga reads the book and takes personal command of the desperate Champa defense
      of Vijaya. He orders his troops to fall out of formation, disperse into the dense
      jungles and hilly coastline surrounding the city, and harry the advancing Vietnamese
      phalanxes and triremes at every turn.\n\fThe hope is this strategy will exhaust
      both the patience of the Vietnamese nobles and Vietnam’s Burmese allies. The Trung
      sisters inexplicably experience a creeping sense of déjà vu...\nOf Note: Is this
      the first compound bow unit? Also, Filipino workers and warriors working the mainland
      near Da Nang and a Burmese settler in Mandalay Bay. Don’t be embarrassed, little
      settler. Just be yourself. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."

    narration: |-
      Leonidas, marching north with his hoplites, reads a copy of How to Fight Wars Good and gets really super inspired. He decides the surest path to victory in his many-fronted war is not concentrating on Cumae first to secure his supply, but simply committing 100% to ass-kicking everyone everywhere all at once. He shares this new strategy with his generals who seem so impressed with its brilliance they are left speechless.
       Leonidas’s son, Leonidas the younger, knows this is folly yet says nothing. What can he say? He can never admit to his father that he scotched his own daring assault on Cumae because he was so moved by a polish soldier’s love of a simple, beautiful flower. These are feelings no Spartan should ever feel, let alone reveal...
      Of Note: The Portuguese have settled the island of Corsica and Byzantium seems to be finally building a navy.

      President Juárez reads the communiqué just brought to him by carrier parrot from his, General Santa Ana. “Your Excellency, As per your orders, I am moving the pieces into place for Operation Phagocytosis. Austin will be yours by the end of the week. My adjutant Pedro (a bit of a striver but still a good lad) has given me an early birthday present; a copy of a new book from far away China called How to Fight Wars Good. If anything in this book helps me to slaughter Texans more proficiently for the greater glory of the Mexican Empire and our Lord, I will let you know.”
      Of Note: Catholic missionaries and a great prophet spread the faith up the California coast. Also, did that Irish scout just wind up trapped in a forest in Mississippi?

      "Abraham Lincoln reads his classified briefing from CIC William Westmoreland:
      “There has been some concerning and frankly surprising blow-back from Operation
      Jade Helm. It looks as if Sam Houston has gotten, if you’ll forgive the vernacular,
      all the cowboys off the Ponderosa and sent ‘em on up there a hootin’ and a hollerin’
      round near Baltimore. I assure you, Mr. President, this is just a bump in the
      road. I have just read a fascinating new book by the Guy Who Won All Those Wars
      called How to Fight Wars Good, and I know exactly what to do.” \nLincoln furrows
      his brow, thinks of the upcoming election and this Trump moron he must contend
      with. This war was meant to make Lincoln look like a leader, and make Trump look
      like a callow politician. At least, that was the plan."

      Giáp, advises the Trung sisters to tax their nobles and throw more men at the
      weakened Champa city. The Trungs ask Giáp if he’s read this new book from China
      everyone is talking about. Giáp laughs. “The Vietnamese people need no such instruction.
      We know in our bones how to fight wars good.”"

      people, and in one of their oldest traditions, the citizens of newly founded Kingait
      gather together to choose which elder will lead the settlement. Elder Sarahuri
      Palinuq proposes that she should be governor of Kingait because she can see Yakutia
      from her igloo.

      "When word reached Ivvavik about the Sioux settlement of Sichangu, what
      had been a cold war suddenly got very hot. A great number of Inuit nobles argued
      for war, but as usual up here, cooler heads prevailed.\nStill, one general in
      particular inspired the Inuit people’s bloodlust by taking fifteen of his heartiest
      warriors and heading south. When couriers were sent to find General Spartacus
      and return him to the capital at once, men along the road would shout ‘I’m Spartacus’
      in a spontaneous display of solidarity and patriotism. \nAfter proving his point
      and making it almost all the way to the Sioux frontier, the General relented and
      headed back to the capital. Deep down he trusted his king, and he knew that the
      Inuit would not be content to continue a cold war against the Sioux forever."

      "With Castro settled and growing, the Chilean grasp on Patagonia tightened.
      Eva Peron instantly regretted listening to her advisors and sending those colonists
      to the shores of the Caribbean. \nShe fell into one of her dark moods and retreated
      to her chambers. Everyone in her court lived under a cloud of anxiety. Who will
      she behead to exercise her foul temper? \nA week later her chamber doors were
      open, her rooms empty. She was found waiting for her advisors at the head of the
      council table; a broad smile on her face and her eyes fixed with a steely thousand-yard
      stare. Once everyone took his or her seat, she spoke. “I have just read the most
      enlightening book from China,” she said.\nOf Note: Argentine settler up north
      – that’s the one we saw in Part 4 - still has yet to settle."

      for fear the cold could descend on them at any moment. A lot of them just straight

      Tragedy! King Leonidas dies in combat on the outskirts of Lodz! Leonidas the younger, fighting in the forests between Cumae and Tegea, takes the reigns of both the Spartan government and military and quickly makes peace with Rome.
      He knows full well Cumae could have been taken if only his father hadn’t been so rash. And if only that flower had not so moved him... He explains this temporary peace to the Oligarchs as a way to ensure a greater victory against more important foes. But in his heart, he knows the truth.
      Leonidas the younger orders all copies of How to Win Wars Good burnt.
      Of Note: British triremes out of London raid Cologne!

      Iceland settles Newfoundland. Does this make them the first colonizer of another continent? The Hawaiians and Sri Lankans have something of a claim to this honor as well, but then you get into this question of what island chain belongs to what continental shelf, and that whole area is just a real geologist’s sh*t show.
      Of Note: Poland denounces Germany. You bet they do. Also, the Zulu denounce the Ashanti.

      “The book I told you about is a revelation. I have a new plan. Do not worry. You
      will see results!” \nPresident Lincoln receives yet another briefing from CIC
      Westmoreland: “Well, this is embarrassing. I know it looks as though Baltimore
      is in in danger of falling to, like, 50 Texans with clubs, but I promise you,
      whatever the optics, thanks to the lessons I have learned from this incredible
      Chinese book, we are in total control of the situation.” \nLincoln makes emergency

      "Both spies were consummate professionals and had worked well together
      over the last year, quietly coordinating their respective nation’s joint sneak
      attack on Texas. \nThey’d come to look forward to their clandestine, far-flung
      meetings. They’d grown to be men of the world together and, surprisingly, they’d
      grown to be friends; although both were too seasoned to openly admit such a thing
      was truly possible. \nNow they had to meet again; this time under a cloud of failure
      and confusion that both nations sought to blame the other for. Paradoxically,
      they both dreaded this meeting and looked forward to it with great anticipation.
      \nWhen Ramon suggested the barren outskirts of Auyuittiq for their meeting, Paul
      didn’t even have to look at his ravishing limited edition folio by famed cartographer
      SylonL. “I know where we can get some passable churros near Auyuittiq,” Paul responded.
      He knew Ramon would like that. Maybe that would help. \nOf Note: The Sioux continue

      it for a chance at Cologne. Elizabeth wouldn’t hear of it. English soil shall
      remain English, she demanded and she ordered a vigorous defense of Hastings. For
      his queen to be right, everything the Black Prince read in that book he got from

      it hard to argue with her wisdom. It was an eminently defendable city. Perhaps
