  narration: "Welcome back to the Battle Royale! Today we get to see the super-long
    part, the part you were all waiting for! It contains drama, wars, peace deals,
    cities falling, and eliminations, the things we all love!\n \nYour narrator for
    today is /u/TA_Knight! After my (kind of lackluster i think) narration for part
    20, i went and gained much more narrating experience under my belt, with 7 AI
    games of various sizes narrated and posted to /r/CivAIGames, i should be able
    to provide a better narrator experience. Nonetheless, feel free to submit criticism
    on my narration, as i will welcome all of it!"

  narration: Always helpful to see at the end of each part, the map of the world!
    Usually made by /u/Malistrassa, but made by /u/Malstrassa after the former went
    inactive ):. The city list is made by hardworking /u/LacsiraxAriscal, who also
    tracks city sizes and marks cities above size 30 as metropolises. A lot of cities
    are going to change owners this part, so who ever updates the map will have a
    lot of work to do..

  narration: "The Boers once again appear back at the top of the rankings thanks to
    their absolute dominating military and tech. If they just warred other nations,
    they wouldve had it all.\n \nYou can see the rest of the rankings at http://imgur.com/a/CqjKx/layout/horizontal#0"

    Senshi‘s note: Just before we begin, here‘s an excellent graph by /u/JasonBourne008 detailing all the gory deaths we‘ve witnessed over the past 53 parts! Interesting how little impact nukes have had on the grand scheme of things, eh? Anyway, this graph is sure to increase in magnitude over the coming sildes, if you catch my drift ;)
    Anyway, back to your usual narration!

  narration: "We start off with a shot of the Australian/Kimberly vs Sri Lanka battleground.
    As evidenced by the minimap at the stat slides of the last part, Australia has
    flipped Galle and Kalumnai, however, Sri Lanka has regained their capital from
    Kimberley hands. Despite starting the war, Kimberley will have to try much harder
    to gain a city out of this, as i dont see any Kimberley melee ship in the image.\n
    \nAlso noteable in this image is that the Australians are making good use of carriers!
    Every carrier visible carries 2 planes, with 6 backup planes in the nearby city.
    Australia is sure trying to employ good battle tactics here, to make up for the
    long distance they have to move their ships to get to Sri Lanka."

  narration: "Ah, South America. Once a very boring continent, until Argentina scored
    the first city flip in a few hundred turns, taking Machu from Inca. From then
    on, all hell broke loose, with Argentina and Inca ending up being eliminated.
    Now, Only the Buccaneers, Brazil, and Chile remain.\n \nSince the disasterous
    Brazil-Buccaneer war, Brazil has invested heavily in a unit carpet. The Buccaneers,
    however, only own a few units on South America, most batched up near the Brazilian
    border, in case of an invasion, though im not sure how well they will be able
    to defend. Brazil has a warmer relationship with Chile, though, since they seem
    to share open borders."

  narration: "Korea continues on their tech advantage, unlocking Drone UAVs, trying
    to get the more powerful units first. Also noticeable is Korea owning Nuclear
    Submarines, which, strangely enough, were rarely found in any other nation, even
    if they were already supposed to gain access to it. Their carpet is diverse and
    made of multiple powerful units, but i fear it wont be enough, considering their
    low production potential.\n \nAlso, an all-too-predictable happening announcement
    at the top...."

  narration: "The Inuit take out the Sioux, eliminating them in the 34th place, having
    declared war on them last part. Sitting Bull never had so much of a chance, but
    they did develop an impressive city for a civilization in the Renaissance era.
    Too bad the Inuit had to ruin it, as usual.\n \nOn another note, this means that
    the Blackfoot are becoming slightly more encased by the Inuit, city by city. Once
    thought to be the barrier for the rest of the world from the Inuit, the blockade
    proved ineffective. Now, what is the purpose of the Blackfoot? Sniping cities
    in the middle of nowhere, apparently."

  narration: Welcome aboard, Europe! Iceland, after so much time, engages in a war
    of actual scale in a long time, although caused by nations declaring war on THEM
    rather than vice versa. Iceland is fielding multiple Advanced Destroyers, which
    are wrecking France‘s cities and flipping Orleans, while Paris and Hastings are
    bombed by planes. While Orleans and any other city Iceland takes is likely to
    flip, this will still severely hurt France, who owns only 8 cities, 4 of which
    are vulnerable to Icelandic ships.

  narration: "To the west, Iceland is making mincemeat out of the French ancient navy.
    Soon, there will be nothing to defend France‘s core.\n \nAlso pointed out by Tpangolin,
    the last Carthagian survivors are found in France, two Punic scouts, one next
    to Hastings, and the other next to York. I wonder where will they move after Iceland
    removes France from existence."

  narration: "Meanwhile at East Asia, Yakutia is plotting against Mongolia, a war
    which all of us were anticipating ever since the single digit parts, but never
    happened. Despite all the events around the world, Yakutia still looks like they
    could take on Mongolia, despite the Mongolian carpet, thanks to their tech advantage.
    If the war happens before both nations hit the tech limit, that is.\n \nAlso noteable
    is Sibir fielding Mech Infantry as they slowly but surely modernize their carpet.
    Maybe they plan to take on Finland."

  narration: "Australia makes landfall! Vavuniya falls to an Australian destroyer,
    along with Colombo. Sri Lanka appears to have ran out of naval defences, so the
    war will be taken right into the main land.\n \nKimberley has yet to give up on
    Sri Lankan booty, and has sent a new squad northward, though currently its blocked
    off by Australian ships. Im surprised Australia even gave Kimberley open borders,
    though this may have served a taunt to Kimberley rather than a gesture of friendship."

  narration: "Afghanistan is still holding on to life, only surviving thanks to Vietnam‘s
    AI trying to attack the closer, highly fortified cities instead of heading into
    Kandahar. Afghanistan is getting cocky though, fielding Marines instead of the
    stronger Infantry, although it seems to be working so far.\n \nAlso, it appears
    that Finnish troops are fleeing Afghan territory. Maybe they dont want to be cought
    in the crossfire?"
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene14.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Sri Lanka takes back Vavuniya! Unfortunately, their home islands are
    all but overrun by the Australian onslaught. More and more Australian reinformcements
    are coming, and Henry Parkes isnt showing any mercy. The only good news coming
    for Sri Lanka at the moment is that their northern cities are secured by Finland,
    so Sri Lanka cannot be eliminated, at least.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene15.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "The Eastern coast burns! Vavuniya falls, Polonnaruwa falls to zero health,
    relocated capital Anuradhapura is under bombardment fire, and Lahore looks to
    fall to an ironclad. Kimberley wedges their squad though the Australian waves,
    hoping to get any of the ridiculously named cities.\n \nAt the sidebar, Agent
    Em uncovers that Chile is plotting against the Last Ashanti Pikeman. Rumours has
    it that the pikeman knows of the location of the Golden Stool, however, this mission,
    should you accept it, will require delving deep into Boer territory."
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene16.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "The French navy is shredded beyond existance as Iceland puts the pressure
    on Hastings. Orleans flips once again, and additional Advanced Destroyers harrass
    the foritified city of York, who appears to be the best city France has to offer.
    One wonders why the best French city is actually foreign.\n \nAlso can be seen
    her is some open border treaties, with Finnish troops in Iceland, and Vietnamese
    troops in Buccaneer territory. The last one is especially interesting as the two
    powers are as far from each other as possible, and produced Vietnamese units can
    appear on Africa, Europe and Central America simultaneously. This grants them
    better power vectos than the Finnish!"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene17.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The Sioux are down to the last remaining unit, a musketman. Looks like
    the Inuit are going for a complete genocide. Perhaps its for the good, as by the
    words of Rtas ‘Vadum, even a single zombie spore can destroy a species. Or Tronald
    dump.

  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene18.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "South America isnt going to descend into silence! The Inuits and the
    Buccaneers form a coalition against Chile, after they had taken out the majority
    of Hawaii. The Buccaneer-Chile front will surely be dubbed as the ‘War of White
    and Gold‘, due to their near identical schemes. Good grief.\n \nOn another note,
    Chile is showing a severe lack of land units in this image. It isnt likely to
    harm them very much, though, as this war will form almost entirely on sea, with
    navies clashing, so it may be best to spend the production on water-borne vehicles."

  narration: "High contrast version: http://i.imgur.com/gqavIBi.jpg?format=webp&quality=80\n \nThe first
    casuality of the war is Tiwanaku, taken by a blitzing tank, Although Chile has
    the navy to take it back. The Buccaneers will need to move their navy in if they
    want to progress past Tiwanaku, as the land is treacherous and will prevent any
    conquest by land."

  narration: "Alas, formerly-peaceful state of Hawaii. Now a centre of city flips
    and wars, as Brazilian units make their way into Honolulu, though they are oddly
    boxed in by Vietnamese and Australian units.\n \nFew Inuit ships start to make
    their way into the occupied Chileian cities, though none of these are melee yet."

  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene22.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: France is simply collapsing - Hasting falls, Orleans flips, Troyes is
    now without the naval defences, and York falls further, although a trolling Buccaneer
    Adv-Destroyer is blocking it at the moment.. The Punic scout at Hasting appears
    to have been catapulted into lands unknown, probably visiting the Great Elephant
    in the sky, or perhaps wondering what crimes they must have committed to end up
    in the frozen Inuit lands of the north.

  narration: As the wars rage on, we are treated to a shot of the south of North America.
    Mexico appears to be on the brink of the Informatic Era, sporting many Rocket
    Artillery, along with some tanks and submarines, wnile the Inuit nearby is pretty
    much empty, though the few units that are seen are fairly advanced.

  narration: Vietnamese troops are starting to be catapulting into Buccaneer Africa,
    forming a carpet of their own in the area. Like the Boers and Finland before them,
    if they can make use of this occurance, they can make very great gains off middle
    and middle-lower nations.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene25.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "While Vavuniya is on pancake duty, the Kimberley squad seems to have
    failed taking a city, with only 2 units remaining. Thats a shame, as everyone
    hoped Kimberley could recover from the Australian war on them, kind of like Romania
    from the European Domination game.\n \nSri Lanka appears to have sent off all
    their remaining units into the western coast, to stop the Australian waves as
    long as possible, however, Australia has pulled off a Xanatos Gambit, sending
    their navy into the now unprotected eastern coast. I see no way Sri Lanka recovers
    from this."

  narration: "High contrast version: http://i.imgur.com/NR0c1m8.jpg?format=webp&quality=80\n \nTiwanaku goes
    back to Chile as they mount a counteroffensive on the former Inca coast, damaging
    Vitcos. Considering Vitcos holds 10 planes and bombs, this looks like a valuable
    target to disarm, even if by making them move out of range."

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene27.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Orleans mostly seems to have flash backs from the time France fought
    England. The Buccaneers, however, are insisting on making as much havoc as possible,
    as they still block the way to York. If you like it so much, you should have DOWed
    it!

  narration: "Suspiciously waiting at at Chilean shore are a few Boer units, one of
    them being an Arsenal ship, fully loaded with Hypervelocity missiles. What mischeif
    are you planning for, Mr. Kruger?\n \nAlso, a Chileian Advanced Destroyer can
    be spotted, but by the looks of it, it was grabbed by a Prize Ships promotion
    from the Buccaneers."

  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part54-scene29.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: "As Tpang shows, the Hypervelocity Missile is a Guided Missile upgrade,
    though not much more useful, with 120 strength. Its rather cheap, though.\n \nThis
    unit was actually unlocked a while ago, back at Drone Fighters, but the AI doesnt
    tend to build missiles, since they, for a luck of a better word, suck like the
    strength of the French fleet."

  narration: "The last remaining scout flees to the sea as York is no longer protected
    and seems about to fall. Unfortunately he forgets they he cant actually escape
    into the open sea, as Iceland owns all the tiles around France. Well, guess the
    scout will have to be teleported somewhere else.\n \nThe first Icelandic units
    start to land on French soil, ready to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, these are a
    Cavalary and an Anti-Tank gun, but hey, its a start! Also noticeable is an Icelandic
    nuclear submarine, an unusually rare sight on the BR."

  narration: These who spied the sidebar and minimap (you cheeky little you!) will
    notice that Vietnam has ended the war on Afghanistan, but not without cost! Lahor
    and Samarkand are seen here now donning green flags, and the minimap shows more
    cities..

  narration: "Oh boy, Isfahhan and Mazar-i-sharif are also given, basically having
    Susa, a formerly Persian city, locked away from the rest of the empire. In the
    minimap, it can be seen that Afghanistan still controls their antartic holdings,
    though.\n \nAll in all, in the war, Afghanistan lost 5 cities, gave away 4, and
    now holds only 6 cities. Truly brutal.\n \nAfghanistan wont be able to catch a
    break, though, as the Kimberley and Mongolia declare a joint declaration of war,
    hoping to gain from the weakened state! Kimberley may actually be able to attack
    Susa though Sri Lankan or Australian territory if they commit to it."

  narration: Meanwhile on political news, Sweden got embargoed. More on that, because
    holy shit - Sweden got modernized! All the little horsies vanished and became
    anti-tank guns, and Advanced Destroyers start to pop up in Swedish territory.
    If they upgrade their destroyers as fast as their Hakkapeliittas. their army will
    be truly terrifying.

    globally recognized religion, but unfortunately fails. Maybe Benito Juarez wasnt
    smexico enough? Huehuehuehue\n \nAfghanistan starts to become a hot spot as Canada

    navy shortage continues, Chile brings Vitcos down to yellow, however, the Buccaneers
    are sending infantry down to Tiwanaku, hoping to flip it again and distract Chile
    off Vitcos. Cusco is off limits for now, thanks to a Canadian scout, following
    the footsteps of the famous Polish scout, known for saving a Roman city from the
    Spartans. All remaining scouts strive to, one day, be as important as he was to
    the grand events of the world."

    cities core, along with their exclave on the Middle East.\n \nIn the war so far,
    Sri Lanka lost 1 city to Kimberley, 5 more to Australia, and gave away 3, leaving
    them 4. Considering they are still at war against the Kimberley, they may actually
    drop further, but for now, they may have a relatively peaceful time."

  narration: First time in this part, a shot of the Frozen War. Mongolian, Korean,
    Australian and Finnish peacekeeping forces are all trying to slow down an already
    completely stagnating war, causing to the war to stagnate so much it underflows
    and allows the Yakutians to advance on the Sibirians, putting units capable of
    city capture near the city.

  narration: The next to join the war against Afghanistan is PERSIA!! Persia, who
    has did jack-shit the entire game, aside from border skrimishes against Timur,
    Arabia and Afghanistan, turn on the weakened Afghanstan, looking at a very tasty
    Susa. The city immidiately falls to red thanks to arial bombardment, so all that
    Persia needs is to thin out the residing units then lead a melee unit into the
    city.

  narration: "YORK FALLS! Iceland is completely rolling the french, landing multiple
    units, such as Mech Infantry and Paratroopers to secure Orleans and move into
    Paris. The Icelandic navy almost completed their task, and now they only need
    to fell the city of Troyes to control the entire coast.\n \nAppropiately enough,
    the Great General next to York is Augereau, or, Pierre Augereau. The man was a
    french general at the time of Napoleon, and, according to wikipedia, was actually
    supposed to invade England, although the attack was called off. Seeing the general
    standing next to a formerly English city, falling to an army from England, though
    not quite English, is oddly eerie."

  narration: The Boers are, as always, a completely another world of gameplay. They
    act like a player playing scientific victory on a low difficulty, leaving everyone
    else in the dust and not warring anyone at all. This time they have built the
    Virtual Idol wonder, THE cultural wonder of Future Worlds. Not exactly useful,
    but still nice to have.

  narration: The Virtual Idol is more of a tall empire cultural wonder rather than
    an AI one, so its not much of an effect. Nonetheless, its powerful, though not
    as any of the big three wonders of Future Worlds, The Skynet, the Angelnet, and
    the Pholus Mutagen.

    itself an upgrade of the Helicopter Gunship. It boasts 100 strength to the Vertol‘s

    sea tiles, so dont put too much trust in this information. The Inuit still have
    the most actual land tiles to place units on.

  narration: "Australia is only one city away from the 100 cities mark! Who will they
    take the other city off?\n \nAlso wierd here, is Canada reappearing on the top
    charts. They have 24 cities now, where last part they had 20. Where did they get
    these cities from? Because its certainly not from warfare."

  narration: Basically a list of rump states and near-dead civilizations. There arent
    really many civilizations with actual power left.

  narration: The Boers and the Inuits continue to march on, with them researching
    3 and 4 technologies respectively this part. Australia makes a colossal jump out
    of seemingly nowhere, researching 6 technologies this part, shooting them all
    the way from the 11th position to the top 5! Lets hope they put that into good
    use.

  narration: Probably a first in which we get data on the mid-position civilizations,
    though mid-tier they are not. Arabia and Sri Lanka are surprisingly high, and
    the Maori are still somehow 20th despite being dead for a while. Kimberley has
    quite stagnated thanks to losing so many of their cities and the tech penalty
    imposed on it. Sparta is, sadly, absent from here. Why cant they tech up?

  narration: "Id like to first focus on the minimap here, seeing as this is turn 574
    rather than turn 573. We can see that Denkyira has fell to the Boers as expected.
    Konongo surprisingly isnt bearing orange, though it may have flipped back and
    forth.\n \nAnyway, Catholicism is still rising above Judaism, developing a very
    impressive difference of 200 population units between them. Islam is still, slowly
    as hell, falling down to zero, as they drop under 20 population units to 19."

  narration: "As for the religion map, we can see that Catholicism is still working
    on converting the last athestic holds in South America. Buddahism, however, is
    waging war on the last athestic dominion of the world, Polynesia. Right now Buddhist
    priests and prophets are spreading the religion into New Zealand.\n \nAnd thats
    the end of the long part 54! Im your narrator, /u/TA_Knight, and i wish you all
    a peacekeeped night! Beware the Draka in the shadows!"
