    Hello Ladies and Gentlemen, and welcome to part 43 of the Civilization Battle Royale, presented by the benevolent god /u/TPangolin. I’m your host; New Englander, “Science!” Guy and fellow redditor and civ junkie, /u/ParsnipPizza. Remember to check out all the awesome OC, stats and shitposts dedicated to this AI game over at /r/civbattleroyale. Let’s dive feet first into the action!

  narration: But not before checking out this detailed map by confirmed cool people
    /u/SylonL and /u/LacsiraxAriscal. Most notable is the growth of Korea in North
    Vietnam and the metaphorical, literal and geographical knife the Inuit are twisting
    into Texas. And man, is it some knife. Finally, F for Sylon, as this is his final
    map.

  narration: For some visual representation on what Civilizations are close to extinction,
    check out this map made by our very own /u/AlbinosRideDinos! These of course are
    based off of the Power Rankings by our panel of experts. Speaking of...

    The highest rated civ right now are the Inuit. It’s close, but I’d certainly say they are unmatched in their sphere of influence. Full rankings are here: http://imgur.com/a/JK7ii/layout/horizontal#0

  narration: And we return to one of the most decisive wars since Boers/Kongo. Texas
    has again lost Houston, and will spend most of this part flipping Gonzales, Austin,
    and Dallas. Sam Houston hasn’t lost this many people since the Alamo. That or
    the Mexican massacre of Austin all those years ago. Either way, rip Texas, you
    were a power. And then you got annihilated by the White Walkers (Inuit). But the
    mysterious notifications on top take us to…

  narration: "...The Balkans where Leonidas (Sparta) and his 300+ gym buddies retake
    Cunae. Envious of this display, Stalin (Soviet Union) declares the  12,482th irrelevant
    war of the week. I don’t like Sparta’s chances vs Gustavus (Sweden). They have
    low city defense and the tech jump by Sweden is too far a gap to ignore. We’ll
    see how this plays out later."

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene07.jpg
  narration: I truly have no idea what’s happening here. I think Burma lost a capture
    to ‘Nam or the Champa but honestly, this area has been a hot mess since the Modern
    Oceanic Wars started. Note the capital of the Kimberly government-in-exile, guarded
    by some very nice destroyers. TPang also indicates the Part 1 champ Mughals have
    ended a slightly relevant war vs the Champa. And so it goes, as one might say.

  narration: 'More relevant: Korea! As a devoted fan to the nation of science, I am
    pumped Sejong (Korea) took advantage of The Trung’s (Vietnam) distraction with
    Burma and ‘Stralia. The extra cities are going to be a boon for the highest non-uber-power
    tech lead. Also note the appearance of the Korean Air Force in Seoul and Hue.
    Meanwhile, /u/Lunatic49’s girlfriend Mao (China) watches, surrounded by Mongolian
    bodyguards.'

  narration: 'The Flying Lions stationed at Tegea are certainly formidable. Several
    Bombers and Triplanes have been supporting Swedish GWI in their successful push
    against the Oiled Menace. Meanwhile, Boer Paratroopers land deep in Swedish territory
    in order to visit the Central European tour-du-force: Slap Dead Hitler.'

  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene10.jpg
  narration: A close look at the Inuit interior and man, that’s like 10 Industrial
    Complexes (improvements available with the Future Worlds mod). There are a number
    of Improvements availble with this mod - including Generators, Communications
    Arrays, Nature Reserves and Hydroponic Domes to name a few!
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene11.jpg
  narration: A look at the unofficial Boer lands informally known as “Ethiopia”, “Carthage”,
    and “Ayyubids.” Even then, the F buttons are getting primed as Hannibal (Carthage)
    starts grinding Saladin (Ayyyyubids) into the floor. Ethiopian is marching on
    Cairo, however, and they may keep it should they not go all Ai on this war. Note
    the desperate Party Prophet in Italy, spreading the last of Islam (perhaps not
    even that, anymore.) Farewell, Party Pope.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene12.jpg
  narration: Another look at the Swedish interior, with the Mouse of God noting the
    visiting paratroopers. Some have now made it to Berlin, former home of Germany
    and have indeed slapped dead Hitler. This vacation is really a cover to start
    an amazing war against all the powers in the world, simultaneously. Anytime now.
    C’mon, you can do it Kruger! Think of all the OC propaganda!

  narration: Welcome to reunited Australia, Bruces! Yellow and Green now flies undisputed
    over the continent. If anyone still thinks they were a product of a weak region,
    even after this war, you may need to step outside for a minute. Or two. Or five.
    I know I would consider it after calculating the Shark to Turtle ratio in a hypothetical
    Korea v Aussie Rd 3. Meanwhile the Maori continue to not try to fight Australia.
- scene_number: "14"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene14.jpg
  narration: 'A Maori carrier at duty, an unseen division of the Academic Armada,
    and Inuit naval forces all occupy this image. Total nations: 9. BoatExpo 441 is
    going pretty well.'
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene15.jpg
  narration: And now we know why Korea’s momentum has slowed. Those planes are going
    to be bitches for non AA forces. If Sejong (Korea) wants to keep going, he’ll
    need to focus on Tianjin. Otherwise, the Trung’s (Vietnam) lack any non-naval
    melees to retake possible losses. Vigan is an exception, as those destroyers are
    going to flip that city into the Dvin Zone.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene16.jpg
  narration: Inuit forces continue the onslaught in the Gulf of Mexico, beaten back
    only by the Lone Star Navy. Austin is down to half health, with a Mexican Artillery
    piece cock-blocking some of the White Walkers. The Texan people are nearly broken,
    lacking any black, elected, executive leader to blame or army to even partially
    resist. At least they have their Rangers.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene17.jpg
  narration: A look at the previously thought to be fake South America. Brazil and
    Chile are waging a brutal struggle in and around the Andes. Much of Brazil’s spoils
    are takeable with one GWI, such as that one near La Plata. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers
    fortify Vitcos, once again isolating The Inca from the coast.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene18.jpg
  narration: And now, Land Pirates, dressed as GI s. Morgan (Bucs) has done an outstanding
    job for an AI, now in control of Florida, The Caribbean and much of North-South
    America. Here, Vilcabamba and Sao Luis become Pirate territory, with Manaus about
    to join them. Meanwhile, an Irish scout, hearing news of his country‘s destruction,
    begins sailing home to fight Iceland.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene19.jpg
  narration: "Sri Lanka and Harun (Arabia) duel over Batticaloa. Observers include
    the underrated Afghanistan, orphaned Hun workers and the decomposing empire of
    Darius the First (Persia) Forget each other, why don’t Sri Lanka and Arabia go
    tear through Persia? I mean, Knights? Pikemen?? Even Mao has those! \nRegardless,
    a middle-eastern quagmire could see an invading force in the form of Sri-Lanka
    if they play their cards right."
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene20.jpg
  narration: Portugarrr is looking mighty strong. Kudos to the Bucs for creating the
    first stronghold in another continent. The area is strongly lacking in land units
    however. Either way, that navy is a huge threat to pretty much anyone else in
    the region, as are the fumes from all that rum drinking. Morocco could surrender
    in a week before any ships show up.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene21.jpg
  narration: Now visible are the Inuits gains in the war with Canada (Charlottetown
    and Saint John) . As one can see, Canada is lucky in having been spared the destruction
    now raining on Texas. Currently, the Canadiens are fighting Crowfoot and the Blackfoot.
    Hopefully they’ll run into a couple of Bruins while there. The superior Inuit
    forces look on with giggles.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene22.jpg
  narration: 'As another shot of South American cities in the red, I’ll throw this
    out: which leader is most likely to fight along with their men? I’m thinking Henry
    Morgan would be totally comfortable razing the Incan coastline with his fellow
    pirates. The Trungs, Genghis Khan (Mongolia) Leonidas (Sparta) and Kuchum Khan
    (Sibir) all come to mind as well. Dead last: Maria, who’s 4F for mental conditions.'
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene23.jpg
  narration: The north of SA, where Manaus, as expected is being fortified by the
    Rum Runners. Really nothing new here. Brazil definitely one of the largest worker
    populations, rivaling the Boers.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene24.jpg
  narration: More Texas flipping, as Gonzales flips back to the Texas Rangers. Unfortunately,
    the Inuit are shipping their version of David Freese to the front lines as the
    Information era units start overwhelming Austin. Dallas stays in the White Walkers
    hands. It’s not happening, Texas, just accept your doom. And I apologize to all
    the actual Rangers fans I triggered.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene25.jpg
  narration: 'On another front, the Inuit show off another toy, Modern Armor,  making
    them Civ #2 to accomplish this. As a Korea fan, the Yakutian Navy is concerning
    but not unbeatable. Meanwhile, an Irish privateer resolves to join the scout in
    Érin, as soon as it gets by the scary ice people and yak herders. But we are soon
    motivated to move to...'

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene26.jpg
  narration: "...Africa, as Ethiopia decides to finish off the Party People and Saladin,
    along with irrelevant battle buddy Canada. Cairo immediately flips to Christmas
    colors and Baalbek is next. We may have a kill today, so activate your F buttons.
    Haile Selassie (Ethiopia) also has a chance to make major gains against Hannibal
    (Carthage). This is the Ethiopia that could have snuffed out the Boers BSP (Before
    Super Power). What could have been huh?"
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene27.jpg
  narration: 'Back to North Vietnam or rather, West Korea. Tianjin is finally getting
    touched but probably not going to fall any day soon. My advice to Dear Professor
    Sejong: grab Vigan and pull out! The momentum is kaput and though the Trungs lack
    any mean to capture cities, their productions could risk the loss of all new gains
    (Busan is probably safe). That or start nuking. We are also informed of another
    totally, hypothetically possible but unrealistic war (Inuit v Sweden)'
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene28.jpg
  narration: Please don’t hurt me Kruger, I’m just a humble narrator. Go after Mali,
    they called you a nerd. The carpet has definitely happened for the Boers. Only
    the Inuit could really beat them in a war and even then, not for long. Who’s next
    to grovel at Kruger’s boots?
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene29.jpg
  narration: West Boer-firca gets its first appearance today, with land locally known
    as “Mali” and “Morocco.” Both are vulnerable, both are weak and border a major
    power. Someone please euthanize them? Carthage?
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene30.jpg
  narration: 'Greater Finland appears along with its pet civ, the Soviet Union. Urho
    “Dubya” Kekkonen (Finland), too, has carpeted to an extent. They could beat anyone
    they border minus Sibir. But instead, he’ll keep sending hilarious paratroopers
    to the Middle East. Texan Accent: We must spread Autocracy to the rest of the
    world. Either way, top 5, those Finns.'
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene31.jpg
  narration: To Burma, where Mandalay valiantly flips to ‘Nam once more! Trungs take
    50 years to bring melee unit to front. Rinse, repeat. I’m going to go watch some
    episodes of Band of Brothers to get re-excited for WW2 era war.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene32.jpg
  narration: The Middle East returns and so do I. Man that show is epic. Anyway, Afghanistan
    joins the Sub Club, while Sri Lanka and Arabia continue to skirmish. The Hun workers
    get to be entertained while still on a boat in the middle of the Persian Gulf.
    We can’t all live in comfy nuclear submarines.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene33.jpg
  narration: As foreshadowed, Austin falls, with all three Gulf cities in Inuit hands
    for however briefly. Albany starts getting threatened as does New York.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene34.jpg
  narration: One of the musical Sherman brothers joins the pirate life. He’s inspired
    to write a song about his life for a novelty park in Florida. It will be called
    “Henry Morgan World.” The most popular attraction will be “Watch Millions of Texans
    die!” and “Plunder International Trade!”  Everyone is super drunk, so no one really
    is offended.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene35.jpg
  narration: Austin flips back, World Congress results come out and Bernardo (Chile)
    and Pedro (Brazil) peace TF out. Both will continue to fight off the drunk tourists
    from Morgan-World that are plundering their cities.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene36.jpg
  narration: BRAZIL! Pedro, that was the one city you had to keep and you blew it!
    5/7, they tried. The Pirates continue to attack. Pedro also makes peace with the
    clearer threat, Sparta.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene37.jpg
  narration: The Boers are now embargoed, voted unanimously by everyone. Maybe this
    will get them on the warpath. Also, be ready to press F for Ayyubids. Ethiopia
    is in range to capture Zabid. RIP.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene38.jpg
  narration: Korea celebrates the passing of Science Funding by capturing Vigan and
    continues to keep hitting Tianjin. They won’t hold Vigan but Sejong is certainly
    setting himself as a top 10-minor power. HAIL SCIENCE
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene39.jpg
  narration: Ishtar infers a Maori-Inuit fight. We also get a nice shot of the Maori.
    People are begging for a war with Australia, but I don’t think it’s happening
    yet. Maybe in the Information era, we’ll have our war. The reformed Wobbegong
    looks much tougher than whatever Te is fielding.

  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene40.jpg
  narration: Gulf flips back to the White Walkers, as the Texan Navy desperately tries
    to scramble some semblance of a defence that doesn‘t require massive amounts of
    civilian casualties.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene41.jpg
  narration: A helicopter from the deep recesses of the north prepares to fight a
    Corsair commandeered by the Texans from the Pirates themselves, a phrase that
    is so cool, only a set of sea monsters, dramatic music and liberal use of pyrotechnics
    could make it more awesome. Icelandic and Canadian sailors kick back and watch
    the action.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene42.jpg
  narration: MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!!! Using crack paratroopers, Urho (Finland) has
    brought the seed of Autocracy to the Middle East yet again. “Dubya” Kekkonen is
    on a roll, all he needs now is to win an election by questionable Supreme Court
    decision and let the economy slowly collapse until it’s some other guy’s problem.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene43.jpg
  narration: Another shot of the Swed-Spartan war, with even more peace-keeping Boer
    units filtering in. So far, no real change has happened and the Boers are blocking
    the major action. Even in peace, Kruger stops others from expanding.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene44.jpg
  narration: Baalbek falls, Cairo is fortified and the Ayyubids remain on F watch.
    At least the Great Musician can write a sorrowful piece on the death of Islam.
    Poor Party People…

  narration: Now to Pedro’s Party People, now on a one front war and with some brand
    new AA guns. Meanwhile, the pirates continue to bear down on the Brazilian core!
    Welcome to the Jungle

  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene46.jpg
  narration: 'Canada takes Itazpcho from the Blackfoot and burns it. Honestly, the
    Blackfoot are with Morocco and Mali: not bottom 5 awful but definitely not as
    aggressive as their peers. Crowfoot just wants to have fun. Get ‘em Ekeuhnick
    (Inuit)!'
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene47.jpg
  narration: The Inuit core, where a plot is made to prove who the real blue-snow
    civ is. The amount of plants is staggering. No wonder the Walkers are pumping
    out soooo many units, their production must be through the roof.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene48.jpg
  narration: Iceland plots against Norway. That war would be over faster than...uh...an
    American’s total attention towards soccer. Sorry, I’m running low on quality jokes.
    Not yet at Mencia levels, but we’re approaching it.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene49.jpg
  narration: A list of possible and previous plots. Inuit construction of the Petagon
    is the most plausible in these admittedly useless “plotting” notifications. Fight
    me Em, but you and your colleagues suck at your job.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene50.jpg
  narration: Ishtar will go to Finland, Semiramis to Sibir and the lovely Em to Ethiopia.
    That sounded like an NBA trade deadline post, without tons of Sixers fans obsessing
    over draft picks like John Hinckley with Jodie Foster. Wow that came out fast
    and confusing and loaded with similes. C’mon Parsnip, get your energy back.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part43-scene52.jpg
  narration: Still no F for Saladin (Ayyyyyyyyubids) as Ethiopia continues to beat
    Carthage back. Mampong is under threat and the Boers giggle at all the cute riflemen
    and GWI. They think that‘s an army?

  narration: Norway can into Modern Era and Austin flips back. They, too, are waiting
    for a merciful power to finish them off. Gustavus (Sweden) might after he finishes
    with the Leg Day Legion.

  narration: As shown by our spy network earlier, the same Eskimos build the Pentagon.
    First wonder in a while, I’ll say. No surprise here, although this does bode extremely
    well for the snowball like nature of the Inuit Army in the nightmare scenario
    that unlike Australia, each war just makes them stronger.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: 57

    to the capital and a cockblocked coastal city. Should Machu fall, I expect a land
    invasion of Cusco very soon.

  narration: Austin barely Texan, Gonzales and Dallas not so much. Texas is running
    out of time and melee ships. It’s gonna be a little chilly in Cancun this year.

  narration: Mughals make peace with powers that probably haven‘t visited their lands.
    Ah well, this allows them some more time to play around with their fancy new submarine!

  narration: OH BOY!!!! THE HYPE TRAIN HAS REACHED THE STATION! Aussies and Maori
    throw down the gauntlet in the Second Oceanic War. I predict a decisive victory
    for Bruce-land, not without sever casualties of course.

  narration: The battle rages in the Maori colonies, with the Wobbegong gaining a
    significant upper hand. Also, Norway joins the Lincoln club and adopts Freedom.
    RIP Norwegian happiness.

  narration: Yokohama is under siege by Maori carriers. Both sides look ready to flip
    it to 1 pop by next part. I feel bad for next part’s narrator, who has to narrate
    all those flips.

  narration: F for the Ayyubids, ending them on turn 448. They made early headway
    and founded a small but popular religion based on partying. And they were PR’d
    at 12 once, being a major Medieval power in Africa. Then, the Boers happened and
    the tech gap widened leading us to their demise. RIP, as Ethiopia finishes Saladin
    off.

  narration: |-
    Back to the ANZAC Civil War as several Maori island outpost come under immediate threat. My money’s on Australia landing most of these cities with a reforged Wollongong Armada.
    TPang‘s note: Wobbegong -_-

  narration: Itazipcho flips back to the Black (Foot) and the Royal Air Force is partially
    displayed. The Inuit and even the Canadians can’t stop laughing at Crowfoot’s
    tech level. Meanwhile, Lester peaces out with Hannibal.

  narration: 'Limping to finish here due to time restrictions: Ethiopia fortifies
    Ayyubid/Carthage gains, Boers still scary and International Games coming up. Just
    bet on the Spartans. They sweat Adderall.'

  narration: One powerful Khan plots against another, paper Khan. Let’s hope stupid
    Semiramis is right for once. Also, Boer peacekeeping units move to Snore-kutia.

  narration: Urho plans to put down his pet regime and could do so relatively quickly.
    Stalin hides his fears of this with vodka, vodka, work camps and for a change,
    vodka. The Boers grind Sweden-Sparta to a halt through the magic of open borders.

  narration: I use this slide to plead with /u/Lunatic49 Mao‘s indoctrination of him.
    I doubt it‘ll work, just like all 6 of China’s population. Yay poverty jokes!

    then the field. SCIENCE!!!

  narration: It’s hard to base success on number of wonders. I mean, look at Afghanistan,
    with 4. Australia tops the list because of his recent desert crusade.

  narration: See, look at all the powers with only 1 (Buccs, Brazil, Sibir, etc) You
    could build 3 Great Firewalls vs 1 Petra. Wonders are great for helping you start
    out, especially if you‘re in a bad place - but if you‘re not geographically screwed
    over, then all‘s not too lost.

  narration: Said Champa are loooaaaded, with almost twice as much as the Inuit. It
    helps not having an army to pay for. Wonder if the Boers will start losing money
    now that they are embargoed.

  narration: Religooooooooon. Religion! Speaking of which, Judaism continues to guide
    Western Europe. Now, however, Catholisim has taken the lead, with a grip on both
    Americas. Islam may be 98% dead but at least all 14 followers are still faithful.

  narration: Now the map of all major religions. Thanks so much to TPang for this
    opportunity to contribute and to all of you guys for consistently being awesome.
    I’ll be around screaming “SCIENCE!” whenever Korea nukes someone. Oh and check
    out /r/CBRModelWorldCongress and get signed up. May democracy prevail! For TPangolin
    and the Battle Royale, I’m ParsnipPizza. Go Red Sox!
