  narration: "Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, mutants and cyborgs, to the /r/Civ/
    Battle Royale Part 64! I am your first-time emergency narrator, /u/TechnostarBTD5/.
    This was an unexpected part caused by an incredible surplus of action (or so I’m
    told) in the turns to come. Without further ado, brace yourself for the glorious
    carnage of a world at war! Title card by /u/mikeburnfire/.\n \nNOTE: I have not
    looked through the slides beforehand. Any predictions you see me make are as I
    go through the slides one by one. I had no guarantee whether they would be correct
    or not."

  narration: Before we dive too deep into the action, let’s go over this epic relationship
    chart by /u/mazerlaser/! A huge chain of conflict has unfolded, with all but 4
    nations involved in some sort of war. The only major powers not involved in some
    sort of relevant war (shared border or close proximity) are the Inuit, Sweden,
    Finland, Sibir, Ethiopia, Mexico, and the Blackfoot.

  narration: Here we see a very well done tile-accurate map of the world by /u/edse1991/.
    Vietnam still looks sorta like a dragon and Israel exists again. No city map this
    part due to it’s rushed nature.
- scene_number: "4"

  narration: Time for some action! Here we see the Chilean core, which is looking
    really low on units. Brazilian paratroopers rain from the skies while bombs are
    dropped everywhere except Concepcion. On the western coast, Australia looks to
    hold Santiago for now, as no melee units are near enough to take it. ‘Straya might
    be able to take Valparaiso as well, but only if they have a destroyer off-screen.
    I do not know if they will be able to hold onto Chile’s west coast for much longer,
    however, as they seem reluctant to utilize their carpet of doom currently sightseeing
    in the Galapagos. I honestly can’t blame them; I was there just about a week ago
    and the Galapagos are gorgeous!

  narration: Here we see a nice shot of Hawaii. It would be a shame if an officer
    on that arsenal ship accidentally pressed the big red button to vaporize that
    poor island. On the frontlines of the ‘Straya-’Nam conflict, Iloilo is in Vietnam’s
    hands while frontline cities are still just piles of rubble waiting to be conquered.

  narration: Boethius has taken the time to reaffirm the fact that Australia currently
    holds cultural dominance over 24 nations. While that might sound like over 80%
    of the Cylinder is under the Strayan cultural sphere, keep in mind that this list
    probably includes dead civs that still have units floating around somewhere.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene07.jpg
  narration: "I take back my assumption. It seems that Chile has retaken their capital
    with an embarked Mobile SAM. However, we can see that Australia has detached an
    advanced naval division to recapture the city… Wait. Is that a caravel on the
    front lines? GG, Parkes. While the Wollongong Armada was glorious back in the
    days of wood and sails, it is time to upgrade your navy. At least there’s not
    a Giant Death Robot riding the caravel unlike some civilizations that we know.\n
    \nIn other news, Buenos Aires is in the black with Brazilian paratroopers nearby.
    I do not think that Chile will control that city for long."
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene08.jpg
  narration: "Here we see that Australia has declared war on Sparta. While this might
    seem like a diplomatic move to gain favor with the Boers and Iceland, keep in
    mind that Australia actually has units in Icelandic Europe. Wouldn’t it be hilarious
    to see an Australian exclave in Europe?\n \nAlso, I would like to take this time
    to clarify the difference between exclaves and enclaves, which some people still
    seem confused about. An exclave is a part of a country that is isolated from the
    main country by foreign territory (See Finnish Siberia and Buccaneer Gao). An
    enclave is a country or part of a country that is completely surrounded by another
    country (See Tibet). An exclave can also be an enclave (Such as Buccaneer Gao),
    but this is not always the case. Hopefully this clears up confusion.\n \nA good
    video on this subject with IRL examples of border gore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLxZiiuaXs\n
    \nLooking through the rest of the slide, we can see that Rome is Icelandic and
    Carthage is still Boer, but Sparta is trying to recapture both."
- scene_number: '09'

  narration: Armenia decides to help Ethiopia defend its “longtime friend” Israel
    by citadelling Sparta. Meanwhile, Persia is trying to settle in Armenian Mesopotamia.
    Too bad you can’t settle in territory owned by another player. Persia’s only chance
    at this point is a quick peace deal or for a city to suddenly be vaporized so
    they can settle again.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene10.jpg
  narration: "Here we can see just how screwed Persia is. Two more of its cities are
    in the black with Vietnamese units nearby. At least Ecbatana is being ferociously
    defended by foreign peacekeepers.\n \nAlso, Mongolia’s carpet is spilling everywhere.
    Shouldn’t your units be somewhere else right now?"
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene11.jpg
  narration: Iloilo is back in ‘Strayan hands while 9 cities shown on this slide have
    barely any HP left. Frankly, I am surprised that Cebu hasn’t flipped at least
    once yet, which shows just how good of a defence Vietnam is managing.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene12.jpg
  narration: "Turfan, Otrar, and Beijing are in Korean hands, while Shanghai is Mongolian.
    Surprisingly, Shanghai fell quickly to Mongolia, despite having withstood a massive
    Mongol attack in wars past. I guess only the immortal Mao was able to pull off
    the defense after all.\n \nWhile Mongolia is badly outteched, the Korean core
    is starting to look sparse while Boer peacekeepers block their advances. Personally,
    I hope that the open borders treaty ends soon so that this war can have some serious
    bloodshed!"
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene13.jpg
  narration: Yakutia has actually sent some forces to take Japan! You know who else
    has sent forces to Japan? Brazil. Let’s see which of the two powers actually gets
    a naval unit in position to capture the city! Korean and Finnish peacekeepers
    desperately try to protect the land of Anime and Godzilla, but are only succeeding
    in blocking Yakutia from dropping a nuke on them.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene14.jpg
  narration: Australia has control over all of Borneo, but both sides are running
    low on units to throw into a WW1-like death charge. There are about as many damaged
    cities on this slide as undamaged ones, and planes can be seen flying overhead
    like swarms of insects. Meanwhile, Vietnam might soon start suffering from no-melee-unit
    syndrome, as most of their land melee units in this area are gone and I don’t
    see a single Vietnamese destroyer anywhere on this slide.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene15.jpg
  narration: "IT’S HAPPENING! THE TRIGGER HAS BEEN PRESSED! THE KHANFLICT 2.0 HAS
    COMMENCED!\n \nIn all seriousness, this is big news. If anyone was thinking Mongolia
    might be able to hold out, I wouldn’t get your hopes up. While Yakutia is mostly
    occupied by Finnish units, they have enough units of their own to take away any
    precious manpower that Mongolia has left.\n \nOffscreen, we see that Carthage
    has turned a bit tanner and has started to exercise again as Sparta retakes the
    city, presumably with the destroyers we saw earlier."
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene16.jpg
  narration: Yakutia has 4 atomic bombs lined up to be fired, but first the Boer units
    have to move out of the way. With the rest of the slide, we can see just how small
    Yakutia’s army actually is. However, they might manage to flip a few cities, especially
    with that decent-sized air force.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene17.jpg
  narration: "Prime your F keys, everybody. Koreans wail in disappointment as all
    their favorite anime shows are cancelled, but Yakutia seems to have celebrated
    getting rid of a dangerous ideology  and dangerous haikus by declaring war on
    their new weakest neighbor. Japan might flip the city once, but they are done
    for.\n \nJapan has spent most of the game confined to the northernmost tip of
    their main island. They had a decent start, but were eventually overrun by Australia
    before I even started following the CBR. They made the mistake of choosing Freedom,
    or Freedoom as it is referred to sometimes. They were then killed remorselessly
    by Yakutia, but only after surviving longer than Canada and Arabia."
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene18.jpg
  narration: Ekeuhnick realizes that he was actually at war with Sweden and promptly
    makes peace. Meanwhile in Kamchatka, Vietnamese troops clean up the last of ‘Straya’s
    forces in the region as the Inuit continue to try to resettle the city that Yakutia
    nuked off the map.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene19.jpg
  narration: Here we see that the Blackfoot are now fielding Advanced Destroyers.
    But look at all the Australian troops who are just lounging around on their nice,
    comfortable Hawaiian rafts. Guys, don’t you have a war to fight? Or two?
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene20.jpg
  narration: "THE KHANFLICT HAS HEATED UP! KOREA HAS DECLARED WAR ON YAKUTIA!\n \nWelp,
    I didn’t see that coming. I guess that Sejong decided that Yakutia shouldn’t be
    allowed to have any of Mongolia’s cities. The correct hypothesis is probably that
    Korea wanted to establish itself as an eternal protector of Japan as it did in
    the days of old. A trans-oceanic romantic sense of bonding and camaraderie of
    sorts. Either that or his citizens’ death threats to Yakutia after their anime
    was cancelled that started this war. Either way, this area of the world will soon
    know even more bloodshed!"
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene21.jpg
  narration: Korea wastes no time putting their forces to use, recapturing Beijing
    and flipping Kanazawa. Osaka is in the black as Korea assists their ally Japan
    in trying to recapture their last city. Finnish units passively observe all sides
    of this conflict, waiting perhaps for the best moment to strike.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene22.jpg
  narration: Korea seems determined to reunite Pyongyang with the rest of Korea after
    years of isolation, quickly pushing the front lines past their exclave and dropping
    paratroopers in Yakutian heartlands. Jokuskai quickly finds itself a center of
    conflict after millennia of peace as a Korean XCOM squad is dropped outside the
    city.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene23.jpg
  narration: Not much progress is made on the western side of this war other than
    a Korean anti-tank gun, SAM, and artillery somehow winding up in northern Yakutia.
    Sanchu and Beshbalik are low on HP but are still reasonably defended.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene24.jpg
  narration: "Here we see a view of Africarr as we are informed that the Buccs have
    made peace with Chile. Our resident pirates had better put some units on this
    land. Or any land, for that matter.\n \nOver in Carthage, Boer units surround
    the city as the Spartans desperately try to continue the tradition of leg day
    in the city."
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene25.jpg
  narration: Here we see a shot of Texas for once and, wait, is that a nuke? Yes,
    the cowboy city-state has acquired an atomic bomb after hearing legends of the
    Maori’s death throes. Could Texas pull off a repeat of the Maori’s last blaze
    of glory or will they continue to live as a rump state that nobody notices? Only
    time will tell.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene26.jpg
  narration: "The Hunnic worker packs up his bags and leaves the island of Sicily.\n
    \nIn other news, the Boers recapture Carthage from Sparta. I think this is all
    the relevant news on this slide, so let’s move on.\n \n \nJUST KIDDING! My prediction
    turned out to be right! Australia now controls Arretium, proving that Finland
    is not the only one who can use open borders to snipe a city half a world away."
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene27.jpg
  narration: As we zoom out, we see that Mantinea is in the black, Australia has more
    units ready to fight in Europe, and that Sweden has brought a nuke to their southern
    border.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene28.jpg
  narration: Santiago flips again as Brazil captures Valparaiso and Castro. While
    the fate of Santiago remains unknown, I expect Brazil to keep the other two cities
    by the end of the war. While Castro looks to flip back to Chile, I can’t see this
    war ending soon enough for Chile to retain much.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene29.jpg
  narration: Unprime your F keys, everyone! Korea rejoices as their favorite anime
    shows are renewed for another season as Yakutian troops are nowhere to be found
    and Brazil has yet to bring a melee unit. Perhaps my eulogy will still be useful,
    but for now, Japan looks to live another day. Meanwhile, Korea prepares vengeance
    on Yakutia in the form of 2 atomic bombs.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene30.jpg
  narration: Leg day returns to Arretium and Rome as Sparta promptly ends the hilarity
    of Australian Europe. Paul Kruger (Boers) tries his hardest to sink the destroyers
    assaulting Carthage, but the Spartan navy might still be strong enough to flip
    the city once or twice more.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene31.jpg
  narration: Sri Unspellable and Australian India take more damage. Meanwhile, the
    Kimberley have a few atomic bombs. Just in case.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene32.jpg
  narration: Persia is down to two cities with Susa likely to flip next turn. Peacekeepers
    valiantly defend Ecbatana and Baghdad might flip back, but Persia’s days are numbered.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene33.jpg
  narration: Our satellites focus on Ethiopian Egypt and Arabia to show just how well
    they’ve carpeted and just how screwed Sparta would be if war broke out. Hawaiian
    units lounge around amidst the mighty Ethiopian forces, still blissfully unaware
    that Hawaii now controls several fewer islands than when they last visited their
    homes. Or that their families were killed in the Hawaiian genocide.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene34.jpg
  narration: Korea makes a push on all fronts, capturing Shanghai, Tyokhtyur, and
    Hiroshima. TPang has used this opportunity to highlight that Korea is now using
    Robot Infantry. Yakutia, you’ll soon be Terminated.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene35.jpg
  narration: Korean, Yakutian, and Mongolian forces skirmish in a ring around a plantation
    near Otrar. Generals will be analyzing the tactics used in this battle for many
    generations, that is for sure. Boer and Finnish paratroopers view the battle from
    the sidelines, hoping to learn new military tactics from the conflict.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene36.jpg
  narration: Korea continues to push the front line in Yakutia, finally reuniting
    Pyongyang with the rest of Korea. Sejong looks to be at a serious advantage, as
    Yakutia’s army is revealing itself to be as nonexistent as it seems at first glance.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene37.jpg
  narration: The Immortal Mao lives on in a scouting unit currently vacationing in
    a Finnish sauna. This nation is so peaceful. It’s a shame, isn’t it? Everyone’s
    killing each other and these people are just stuck in their saunas, doing nothing.
    C’mon, let there be war!
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene38.jpg
  narration: "Kekkonen hears my pleas and holy crap that is a lot of war. I’m sure
    we will visit the other theatres of conflict in the near future, so let’s focus
    on the nations highlighted here.\n \nFinnish “Peacekeepers” promptly abandon their
    facade and pull off one of their signature long-distance captures, taking Sanchu
    from Mongolia. This is definitely going to be Khanflict 2.0."
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene39.jpg
  narration: "Here we see the far-northern theatre of the Khanflict 2.0 as Kuchum
    Khan (Sibir) declares war on Tygyn Darkhan (Yakutia)! Unlike the previous Khanflict,
    Kuchum Khan seems willing to drop paratroopers into Yakutian lands, meaning that
    city captures are very likely at this point. Due to FInland, I don’t expect nukes
    to be used, but Yakutia will soon have even less land.\n \nThe ever-exclusive
    ranks of peaceful but top-20 civilizations is now limited to just the Inuit, Sweden,
    the Buccaneers, and Ethiopia."
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene40.jpg
  narration: Australia retakes Santiago but looks unlikely to hold it. Meanwhile,
    Chile retakes Castro while Brazil prepares to capture Buenos Aires and Puerto
    Montt (Yes this city is totally a port /s). Chile’s core is almost empty, so it
    looks to only be a matter of time before they are unable to retake their lost
    cities. Meanwhile, to the north...
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene41.jpg
  narration: Australia decides to take on yet another opponent as they join with Armenia
    and the Blackfoot to invade Mexico. If Australia actually mobilizes their forces
    in Hawaii, Mexico could easily lose Baja California and be distracted long enough
    for the Blackfoot to regain lost territory. However, keep in mind that both Australia
    and Mexico have a large military presence in Inuit territory, so expect possible
    city flips on fronts you wouldn’t normally expect.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene42.jpg
  narration: Australia has sent a naval detachment to deal with Mexico along with
    a couple of nuclear missiles. One good blast could take the former Hawaiian city
    of Waipahu down from 27 pop. Considering the size of the detachment, I expect
    Mexico to hold for a while, but they will take heavy losses doing so.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene43.jpg
  narration: Unlike the previous Mexican-Blackfoot war, the Australian units in this
    slide will be active participants in the bloodshed to come. Expect these hills
    to be filled with the blood of paratroopers. Other soldiers will die, too, but
    mainly paratroopers considering the composition of the two armies.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene44.jpg
  narration: Kainaa begins to take damage as Mexico tries to use their strategic citadel
    as a place to launch an offensive against the Blackfoot Corridor. Keep in mind
    that the Blackfoot do not have open borders with the Inuit, but Mexico does. This
    will undoubtedly prove useful to Benito (Mexico).
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene45.jpg
  narration: Australia secures Brunei as Vietnam shows symptoms of no-melee syndrome.
    For the first time, Australian forces have captured a city on the Vietnamese mainland.
    True, it is the Malaysian peninsula, but it is still part of mainland Asia and
    represents a possible turning point in the war.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene46.jpg
  narration: Vietnam’s core in Indochina is starting to look sparse in units. In addition,
    the former Burmese canal city of Mandalay has been hit by an atomic bomb. While
    Vietnam can certainly make a comeback, I see the war beginning to tilt in Australia’s
    favor.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene47.jpg
  narration: Brazil’s troops seem to be just “passing through” the waters near the
    Boer homeland. I wonder what Pedro (Brazil) could be planning. Meanwhile, a Canadian
    frigate sails through the southern Atlantic, reminiscing about a time when they
    could eat poutine at home without persecution.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene48.jpg
  narration: Sparta decides that fighting 3 strong opponents isn’t enough and decides
    to finish annexing Armenia. Perhaps this is an elaborate scheme to intimidate
    the Boers into backing off, a roundabout way to defeat Persia (who they are still
    at war with), or just them picking off a weak neighbor. Either way, while this
    war will be decisively in Sparta’s favor, Leonidas would be better sending those
    troops to hold the line at Rome or prevent further Boer advances into the Mediterranean.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene49.jpg
  narration: Brazil still lacks any melee ships to capture Osaka. Meanwhile, Japan
    has stationed a Daimyo in the city (which gives the city extra melee production
    and unit XP). Perhaps they plan on training more melee units in the event that
    they need to recapture their capital again.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene50.jpg
  narration: "Vietnam takes Susa again while Persia recaptures Baghdad. I do not expect
    Persia to last long enough to make peace, but the wall of peacekeepers outside
    of Ecbatana still stands strong.\n \nOffscreen, Mongolia flips several cities,
    driving down their population further."
- scene_number: "51"

  narration: Ishtar reveals that the Buccaneers hope to quickly resolve this situation
    of peace that is plaguing them by proving once and for all who is better at using
    carriers without planes and leaving their land barren of military units. An Iceland-Buccaneer
    war would prove interesting, especially when you consider the Buccaneer tendency
    to do really well in transcontinental naval warfare.
- scene_number: "52"

  narration: "Agent Em has confirmed that nobody likes even the slightest amount of
    poutine and maple syrup to be consumed on the cylinder. Australia, not content
    with fighting 4 relevant wars, wishes to finish the Inuit’s job and end the ghost
    fleet once and for all.\n \nThe mountains west of Sydney continue to glow as a
    reminder of the first time civilian lives were thrown away in a blaze of nuclear
    glory. The lyrics “Where women glow and men plunder” are still being used by the
    Strayan propaganda administration as a constant reminder of why young Australian
    men need to continue throwing their lives into war.\nSenshi‘s note: No poutine?
    Philistines. This is why I stay on the sub."

  narration: "IT IS NOW WINTER WAR 3! INUIT VS. YAKUTIA MK.3 HERE WE GO!\n \nNot wanting
    to be left out of constant bloodshed, the Inuit decide that the only logical neighbor
    to attack would be their eternal rival, Yakutia! While Inuit forces are scarce
    in the area, Yakutian troops are outnumbered 10-to-1 by the Finnish Flying Carpet
    in the area. I do not know how well Yakutia can do while being attacked by 4 of
    their neighbors, but the Finnish peacekeepers should serve as a solid defense."

  narration: Get your F keys out. Persia is down to one city in the black, with the
    peacekeeping force missing one crucial tile to the northwest. Meanwhile, Artashat
    is in the red, and Spartan forces are eyeing the defenseless city to their east.

  narration: The Boers have cleaned up some of the Spartan navy near Carthage and
    have managed to drop an XCOM on Sicily. Meanwhile, a Spartan paratrooper has made
    a suicide charge towards Ravenna. Finnish intelligence points towards Buccaneer
    rum being the main cause. Icelandic drones report screams of “LEG DAY ERRYDAY”
    and other incoherent fitness rants as the paratroopers landed.

  narration: Here we get a nice view of the Ashanti Pikeman and Moroccan Musketman
    in their respective lakes. So far, this area has proved to be relatively peaceful,
    but one misplaced citadel might be all it takes to trigger the Draka.

  narration: Henry Morgan (Buccaneers) decides that Iceland is too cold and instead
    joins the Mexican coalition. Morgan seems to have sent his entire land army to
    the front line but only a fraction of his navy. Also note that Morgan seems to
    have figured out a brand-new use for carriers and has actually started to station
    planes on them. Mexico has responded to this sudden development by ramming their
    own carriers into the Buccaneers’.

  narration: Here’s where one Australian nuke went (The other one is still on the
    submarine next to the helicopter-carrier). Meanwhile, the Mexican navy seems to
    be considerably smaller than we last saw it, perhaps because it is now facing
    assault from 3 sides.

  narration: "Here we see that Vietnam has used perhaps the only melee unit in their
    navy to take Galle. Without an Australian melee unit nearby, it might stay that
    way for a turn or two, but it will eventually flip back.\n \nAgent Em has also
    uncovered that Henry Parkes really can’t stand dead civs and is plotting to rid
    Africa of the last Ashanti pikeman. While that’s great and all, I don’t see how
    he’d get past all those Boer units."

  narration: Here we see a nice view of the Ice Sheet Fleet, learn that the Blackfoot
    now have open borders with the Inuit, and that someone in the United Nations hates
    the Inuit. Seals are a unique luxury that is only generated by the Inuit, so I
    expect everyone else to support this move.

  narration: Finland may have lost Sanchu, but they made it a point to get another
    exclave by capturing Beshbalik with a paratrooper swarm. Meanwhile, Yakutia has
    taken Turfan, but a Korean strike force is laying siege to their capital.

  narration: Khoro is in the black with a Siberian paratrooper in the suburbs. But
    perhaps the most important thing on this slide is that Finland has XCOM. They
    are the third civilization to do so IIRC, and this addition will seriously improve
    their carpet (Which is mostly paratroopers now). Mongolia is now at war with 2
    civilizations that have XCOM.

  narration: Korea continues to plow through Yakutian cities, taking Ambarchik and
    Churapcha. By this point, even if Yakutia does manage to make peace with Korea,
    they will be severely crippled and still have to deal with 3 more conflicts.

  narration: Here we see a nice shot of Icelandic Greenland. Not much is of note here

    the warmth of home he is used to.

  narration: Artashat is at a sliver of HP while Persia puts up a valiant defense
    against the Vietnamese in Ecbatana. The children of Australia will be taught about
    the bravery shown by these allies against Vietnam for years to come.

  narration: Buenos Aires is somehow still Chilean. I am assuming Brazil’s turn has
    yet to process, since otherwise the 4 cities shown here would all be in the black.
    But when Brazil’s turn does process, I expect several cities to flip.

  narration: "Yakutia retakes Ambarchik and Churapcha, but Korea has melee units in
    position to retake the cities the following turn.\n \nUnfortunately, we will now
    be given less conflict in the cylinder, as a very important war between Iceland
    and Japan draws to a close."

  narration: Finland seems to be worse for the wear as Beshbalik falls and Hsia is
    in the red. However, Turfan is at 1 HP, so that paratrooper could potentially
    snipe the city from Korea.

  narration: "Australia’s 2nd nuke is dropped on Monterrey as the Wollongong Armada
    prepares for landing on Baja California.\n \nMeanwhile, 2 more highly relevant

    and the Kimberley."

  narration: "I SWEAR I AM NOT LOOKING AHEAD.\n \nFinland, as predicted, manages to
    snipe Turfan from Korea, and Mongolia is unable to recapture it. Hsia is still
    Finnish, Jokuskai is still under siege, and Korea is surrounding Tiflis.\n \nSo
    far, I have been very satisfied with the bloodshed witnessed in this area of war.
    Yet according to TPang, this will continue."

  narration: The Boers are seen fielding a Chimera in Mongolia. This is not the first
    time we have seen a Chimera (we saw one on Madagascar a few parts back IIRC),
    but this is the first time we have seen one scouting far from home.
- scene_number: "72"
  scene_title: Image 72
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene72.jpg
  narration: As we can see, the Chimera is a futuristic scout, available at Gengineering.
    With march, 4 movement, no movement penalty, and access to the Gengineered promotion,
    the Chimera fufills its scouting duty very well.

  narration: Boer units land on Sicily and Malta, capturing the cities Arretium and
    Panormus and marking the first time that the Boers have captured land generally
    considered European. XCOM squads fill all the unoccupied Spartan land in Italy
    as the Boers prepare to conquer their first holdings on mainland Europe. Rome
    is once again Icelandic.

  narration: Buccaneer paratroopers march towards Guadalajara as their navy lays siege
    to Laredo and Australia blockades Waipahu. Mexico is already taking a beating
    from a combination of nuclear strikes and conventional warfare. Hopefully we get
    to see some city flips on this front soon!

  narration: Australia and Mexico have decided that the unnaturally cold deep south
    is the best place to hold open warfare as paratroopers from both sides skirmish
    between Dallas and Houston as well as other places throughout Inuit lands.

  narration: "Press F to pay respects. Persia has no melee units left in position,
    so we can officially say that they are dead. Australia holds a special broadcast
    to honor their fallen comrades, but elsewhere in the cylinder many are scratching
    their heads as they try to remember what Persia is.\n \nPersia started the Battle
    Royale in a particularly weak spot with little room to expand and very poor terrain.
    Persia’s only large city was Pasargadae, while the rest of their core had cities
    with under 15 population. Persia was at one point able to conquer Baghdad from
    Arabia, but spent most of the remainder of the game in peaceful hiding. That was
    until the Vietnamese attacked, conquering Persia in a span of about 3 parts. RIP
    Persia."

  narration: The Blackfoot are back with a vengeance! Paratroopers fall from the skies
    and recapture Ahahpitape, while a brand-new advanced destroyer liberates A’aninin
    from Mexican rule. Meanwhile, Blackfoot troops occupy the Mexican citadel and
    prepare to hold their newly reconquered territory.

  narration: Here is a still-impressive shot of the Australian mainland. Australia’s
    core seems a lot less empty than Vietnam. Offscreen, Chile has recaptured Santiago
    and Australia’s gains on Vietnam seem marginal at best. This war will probably
    be decided by who has the best production in a war of attrition.

  narration: To finish off this action-filled part, we can see on the minimap that
    Finland has lost Hsia but has gained another exclave, Khoro, as compensation.
    Finland is only at war with Mongolia, so what I think happened was that Mongolia
    sniped Khoro, which was then taken by Finland.

  narration: Onto the InfoAddict slides! Here we see that the Boers are having trouble
    getting their production over 9000 with the Inuit close behind. What is surprising
    is that Vietnam is only slightly behind Australia in production, which just shows
    you how low-production those island cities are.
- scene_number: "81"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene81.jpg
  narration: Here are the military stats. Naturally, the Boers are on top, but Australia
    is surprisingly close. Vietnam has fallen behind Finland in military manpower,
    which shows just how bloody this war has been for them.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part64-scene83.jpg
  narration: Now to the top of the cities chart. Australia is down to 98 here (due
    to Vietnam capturing Colombo and a few other cities on the minimap), while the
    Boers are up to 64 with the capture of Mantinea.

  narration: "Nope! The Boers have completed the tech tree! Lesser nations beware;
    the full might of the Draka can now be directed outwards. Also of note is that
    Korea is only 12 techs off, and the Inuit 10.\n \nNo religion map this time, perhaps
    due to the rushed nature of this part.\n \nThis has been a fun and very bloody
    part! We witnessed the death of Persia and the near-death experience of Japan.
    Ethiopia and Sweden are now the only large nations not involved in a relevant
    war. This has been /u/TechnostarBTD5/ as your emergency narrator. Goodnight!"
