  narration: "Greetings and Salutations Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to what promises
    to be a very enthralling and action-packed segment of the Battle Royale! I am
    blogger/redditor/Welshman u/TheUtterChrisp, and today, for the first time, I’ll
    be bringing you reports from around the globe as it all kicks off! \nIf you’ve
    enjoyed what you’ve seen thus far and are browsing from r/civ or r/all, be sure
    to pop over and join the good folk over at r/civbattleroyale for a spot of friendly
    international trash talk and more in-depth coverage of the geopolitical situation
    that our 60+ civs face today! \nBefore continuing, I would to give a quick shout
    out to the civ modding and reddit communities for being awesome and providing
    some real quality content, and particularly to u/TPangolin for a) making this
    all happen in the first place and b) giving this random schmuck a shot at writing
    for it!\nSo without any further ado, I’m proud to present the Civ V Battle Royale
    Part 11: “Interesting Times”"

  narration: Many thanks to u/SylonL (and /u/Kittke for the gif version) for the latest
    map in a series of fantastic contributions towards this project. It’s definitely
    worth taking the time to examine the world in its current state, because the Wheel
    of Time ever spins onwards, and things will never be the same again...

  narration: "Wasting absolutely no time before getting stuck into some drama, Hawaii
    declares war against the Philippines. This is an encouraging move for the Pacific
    residing nation who will now display a military presence on both sides of the
    gigantic body of water. \nThe Aussies should also be content with this development,
    as despite their position as a fan favourite and a powerful regional competitor,
    they’ve suffered a number of embarrassing defeats at the hands of Jose Rizal (of
    the Philippines) recently. \nAs an additional note, both Toowoomba and Pangasinan
    display signs of heavy damage, and with a Philippine, Kimberley and Australian
    presence in the area, things could still go a number of ways in the tale of the
    two cities.\nThat has a nice ring to it, somebody should write that down."

    Here we bring a report live from further into the Oceanic archipelago. The Philippines must be having a hard time of it at war with the Kimberley, Australians and Hawaiians in just this region alone.
    The city of Laguna appears to have recently fallen to the Kimberley through a powerful naval assault of triremes and galleasses. Jandamarra (of the aforementioned Kimberley) must be counting his blessings, as the securing of this city not only gives him a straight shot up the channel to the rest of the Filipino empire, but also a nice proxy towards a thinly defended Australian city and the lush Indonesian isles beyond…

  narration: "On the other side of the pacific, Canada and their native counterparts,
    the Blackfoot, ironically sign a Declaration of Friendship. This really does not
    bode well for the Sioux, who now find themselves surrounded by enemies on all
    sides. Seriously, somebody take Philadelphia, it’s right there. \nIn the United
    States (or State, at this rate), Lincoln faces a crisis from inside as well as
    out, as known Texan sympathiser Ronald Chump announces his intentions to challenge
    Lincoln’s Presidency. He does this by mounting an extremely aggressive campaign
    focusing entirely on the poor leadership skill and decisions made thus far. As
    such, the “#CHUMP1820 HE BALLS’ED UP, NOT ME” campaign is born."

  narration: Things have certainly reached boiling point in South America! With both
    Brazil and Chile banging down Incan doors on two fronts, one has to wonder how
    the famous turtler will be able to handle this particular conundrum. In fairness
    they probably will, Argentina is too busy settling undefended cities elsewhere
    and the two attackers don’t yet seem to have the numbers. However, it would be
    foolish to rule these developments out.

    Oh Ashanti, you poor, poor, unfortunate souls. Central Africa really isn’t the place to be this time of year, with a cross-continent nabbing Morocco, regional powers Mali and the Boers on both sides and a line of archers to defend themselves with; the curtains appear to be closing for the humble mid-African state. Will they survive to live another day or will they go the way of the Dodo? Only time will tell. That and the Malian army currently storming through its countryside.
    Also to note, the Philippines and the Maori have just declared their intentions to be BBFs for the foreseeable future, trading cricket cards and other oceanic stereotypes I’m unfamiliar with. This doesn’t look good for the Australians, who may just find themselves some contention in their backyard.

    Apparently not for the time being however, as Parkes (of Australia) and Rizal (of the Philippines) call it quits.
    Observe the Vietnamese forces to the northwest. If anything should serve as an incentive for Rizal to tidy up the eastern flank, it’s that, as an attack from Vietnam could strike at multiple locations at once all over their exposed borders.

  narration: "Bad news for the Armenians I’m afraid, as the Timurids, feeling particularly
    courageous, swoop in and annex the city of Bukhara, an impressive feat considering
    its proximity to both mountains and the sea. The capture of this means well for
    the Timurids, as now a greater opportunity to conquer Yervantashat, or indeed
    the Armenian heartland, has opened up. \nI’m not sure what gives me this impression,
    but I’d wager a lot of money that the Siberians know what’s going on."

  narration: "And now for a shot of one of the bloodiest places on the planet, central
    Europe, particularly focusing on the Balkans. What is there to say about the situation?\nIt’s
    a bad time for Rome. With both the original empire and its eastern counterpart
    Byzantium having had simply a dreadful run of things, including the former losing
    the mighty city of Antium to the Spartan onslaught very recently. It says a lot
    about the leadership quality of Caesar that despite having access to both of his
    UUs simultaneously he cannot even hold on to the Italian homeland. \nThere appears
    to be a bit of a kerfuffle happening over in Corinth, however it does not yet
    seem worth commenting on. Also notice that both the Polish and the Germans look
    a little thin on the ground compared to times gone by. The French, Scandinavians
    and Soviets are, I assume, fully aware of this development."

    Meanwhile, fresh faced and smiling from successful Canadian courting, Crowfoot (of the Blackfoot) has uttered a Declaration of War against the Sioux! Most unpleasant for Sitting Bull (of the Sioux), who sits at the epicenter of a whirlwind of war, violence and nasty squabbles.
    A particularly cheeky Benito Juarez (of Mexico), currently engaging in an overwhelming assault on the city of Wahpekute, has stuck a fort near Sisseton, right up Sitting Bull’s proverbial arse. Say what you will about the Sioux, they don’t like it up ‘em, not one bit.

    The battle of the Sarai rages on as Shaoshan falls to the Siberians. Turns out that the Mongolian strategy of having a lone archer taking pot-shots nearby is not very effective…
    To the north, it’s possible to see that the Siberian dreams of expansion don’t just lie to the east, as two settlers make their way through the frozen north to find some inviting mounds of snow to call home.
    To the south, near his capital, Genghis Khan (of the Mongols) appears to have a crack team of troops ready to go and make an impression on his Saraian counterparts, but only the AI programming will tell if he’s competent enough to figure out a decent strategy.

    Breaking news in the land of the free! Canada captures Philadelphia from the Sioux, thus bringing fan dreams of a new “Canifest Destiny” that much closer to fruition. Also that’s a pretty groovy looking army they have there, want trebuchets, much?
    Meanwhile, Lincoln’s constitutional crisis continues, as critics are reportedly unimpressed with his “#WellYouTryBeingPresidentForAF@ckingDayThen” counter-campaign. The prime-time American news distributor, BCNN, is quick to trademark and shriek the headline, “CHUMP STUMPS AND TRUMPS LINCOLN!”

    Fantastic news everybody, Christopher Columbus has discovered Hamburg! He’d taken a wrong turn when going to the shops.
    In other reports, the Baltic Sea is still a ridiculously populated flashpoint that is sure to erupt sooner rather than later. What’s worth noting is that despite a relative lack of navy from the Polish and German neighbours, the Scandinavian nations in general should still probably feel a little threatened due to a little bit of a build up from the west; distinctly coloured green.

    Back in central Asia, the Sarai war slowly grinds to a halt without any other real action taking place. Peace in our time? No chance! The peace announcement barely has time to fly before the Filipino emissary comes bursting in warning of warfare, pillaging and general nastiness coming from their purple brethren, the Champa.
    Also, take a moment to notice the fort placement that Attila (of the Huns) has chosen outside Mosul, making a hypothetical campaign against Qizil Tura a no-brainer.

    And here are the combatants!
    In all fairness to the Champa, who haven’t had the best rep thus far; if I were Filipino I’d be feeling pretty intimidated. As of here, the Champese navy looks pretty gosh dang scary, compared with the opposition, whose navy I’d assume is still on the other side of Oceana. This may really end up being a bad time for the Philippines. With the purple colouring and fantastic city names, all I can really say regarding the Champa at this point is “GO ON, MÝ  SO’N”

    moment that I’m sure a great deal many of you have been waiting for is here, as
    Henry Morgan (of the swashbuckling Buccaneers) strikes. Sensing an opportunity
    in the rather lazy, quiet and relatively outdated Mayan empire he throws…\n...a
    pikeman at them. \nHopefully reinforcements will arrive shortly, else I get the
    feeling that the buccaneers won’t be accessing that sweet Mayan booty. \nAlso
    notice that Texas has also joined the fight on Morgan’s side. As to who would
    get the spoils, we’ll simply have to wait and see."

    You heard it here first folks, Apple endorses piracy.
    That’s where the attacking force was! Making brilliant use of the Panama Canal, Morgan sends an armada of Triremes down to the isolated Mayan city of Tulum. It seems like only a matter of time before it falls into the Buccaneers hands/hooks.

    to Canada, who just completed Notre Dame! \nThey also appear to have absolutely
    no time for the Icelandic spearmen stationed at their border, and have chosen
    to show off their shiny new longswordsmen as a means of putting them off. Winter
    may be coming, but it’s not quite here yet."

  narration: |-
    The Afghani-Timurid war stutters on with no real change, or effort, from both sides. The problem with this particular conflict is that there are far too many mountains and hills. The troops should think about installing slides and ladders. Or invest in some elephants; I hear that they’re pretty good at mountaineering…
    The Armenians appear to have triumphed in their recapture of Bukhara, and to celebrate this momentous occasion they have chosen to…burn it to the ground. Clearly the taint of the Timurids was too much for them to handle!

    and the Carthaginian Empire.  All credit where it’s due to Hannibal (of Carthage),
    after a fairly underwhelming start he’s managed to make something of himself thanks
    to the acquisition of Olympia and especially Arretium. \nPortugal has also just
    made peace with the Ayyubids, surprising exactly nobody. One really has to wonder
    what they were thinking. Maybe they reeeaaallly wanted that one yellow hex between
    Sparta and Gades for “strategic fishing purposes”."

  narration: Has Sri-Lanka finally proved itself to be the empire that breaks the
    Empire-Breaker? It’s far too early to tell, but the loss of the Afghani city of
    Mazar-I-Sharif to the south-Indian civilization certainly raises hopes that we’re
    going to see some real action in this corner of the world. They may want to think
    about fortifying Negombo however, in the event that Darius gets it in his head
    that Persia’s a bit cramped…

  narration: |-
    Meanwhile in South Africa, or “Boersville” at this point, all seems largely peaceful. The Kongo are definitely the underdogs in this region, with a decent looking navy (although lacking range) and a large number of composites, making both defense and city damage a walk in the park. The Boers will need to move forward with great trepidation and forethought in order to ensure that they remain the top dog.
    Also, hey Shaka, loving the warriors buddy. Gonna put on an adorable little show for us are they?

  narration: "Oh boy, things are really going south for the Mayans as the Buccaneers
    implement a brutal two pronged attack. They’ve already lost Tulum, and Chichen
    Itza looks extremely likely to follow. Also, the Texans appear to have launched
    a naval attack of their own, but nowhere near to the same scale. One has to wonder
    if Henry Morgan struck a deal with them to act as a diversion. \nThings couldn’t
    be looking better for Morgan at the moment. With the capture of Tulum, which they’ve
    decided to keep, he has a perfect proxy city for a potential crusade against the
    Incas, who are sitting ducks in a hypothetical attack from the west. They’ve gained
    a reputation for turtling thanks to their thus far extremely effective defense
    against the rest of the South American continent, yet they’re going to need to
    be able to adapt as soon as possible to this new, doubloon-loving threat.\nOf
    note: Argentina finally fortified Parana! About bloody time you nutters."

  narration: "And now for a look at the state of the battle-hardened Sioux. \nThere’s
    certainly a mixed bag on the western front, as they attempt to push back an invasion
    from both the Blackfoot and the Mexicans, yet it could be a little worse.\nSitting
    Bull seems to have stationed enough troops to the north in order to defend against
    the incursion from Mdewakantonwan, and despite the fact that Mexico has fatally
    damaged the city of Wahpekute, the clown of a general has forgotten to reposition
    any melee units to the front lines. If the city falls, it may indeed end in the
    hands of the Blackfoot, instead of the primary damaging force."

    Evidently unhappy with the status quo, and Saladin, Israel declares war upon the Ayyubids, and unleashes a tactic that could be seen as utterly unprecedented...

    Man, these two chaps really have some difficulties getting along don’t they? For perhaps the gazillionth time (official estimates suggest), Poland and the Nazis once again find themselves at war. It’s interesting that Poland was the one who threw the first slap, because if anything, the Nazis look a little more prepared in terms of troop location to launch an invasion into Polish territory.
    I’m not sure how long it’s been that way, but “tee-hee” at Sparta’s encroaching fort placements towards the city of Cumae. Sassy bugger.

  narration: It’s really all kicking off everywhere now, as an emboldened Morocco
    starts its own campaign against their comparatively smaller neighbor Carthage.
    It’s an interesting turn of events, as Morocco now leaves itself completely open
    to a potential Portuguese invasion, and at least in archery, they appear to be
    out teched by their eastern neighbour. However they have pikemen to Carthage’s
    spearmen, so the war could really go either way. Consider European powers a wildcard
    in this conflict.

    Ahmad (of the Morrocans) that their Great Leader appears to have gotten a little

    Back in the Caribbean wars, the Mayans desperately hold off against a ruthless attack from both the Buccaneers and the Texans. Surely it’s only a matter of time before Chichen Itza falls? Additionally, the Buccaneers appear to have no less than two great generals at their disposal.

    progress, if just by a little. Those Chilean triremes look awfully close to the
    Incan city of Tiwanaku. In the event this city falls, as the Incan land forces
    are currently engaging the Brazilians, the Chileans could reinforce with land
    troops and then make a decapitation strike at the Incan capital itself. \nMeanwhile,

    See that massive army/naval troop stack in the sea there? It’s pretty formidable isn’t it? It’d be great against the local powers like Arabia, Israel or Afghanistan. Or you know Darius (of Persia), you could just declare war on someone half a continent away…
    Off to the east, the Afghans aren’t very pleased with the Sri Lankan acquisition of Mazar-I-Sharif, and so are, apparently to great success, doing something about it. It’s not like the campaign against the Timurids is going anywhere!

    numerous incursions from the surrounding nations have left the real life world
    power struggling for relevancy. The dire straits that they find themselves in
    have become ever more prevalent in Chinese popular culture. The new hit musical
    “The Sound of Warfare,” has sold remarkably well, and some of the more popular
    tracks it contains, like “Oh God, The Hills Are On Fire”, and “How Do You Solve
    A Problem Like Korea?” have remained at the top of the charts for a depressingly
    long time."

    The Vikings are coming! As well as a potential Polish offensive from the east, Hitler (of Nazi Germany) now finds himself feebly swatting away a gigantic Norwegian navy from the north. All that Oslo would really need to do here is hurl boats at Hamburg until it falls over, and they certainly have no shortage of those!
    Kudos to Sweden, Stockholm is looking pretty neat there at a comfortable size 22. Take some notes Darius.

    torn as to who to root for here. Should I remain loyal to the union and back my
    English cousins, or go further back in time and support the more Celtic influenced
    nation? Maybe we could just unionize and give those who live across the channel
    a proper good what-for. \nEither way, the military buildup around Limerick is
    starting to look a little scary, especially if you happen to live in Canterbury.
    Having said that, an Icelandic forward settle onto the west of Scotland may prove
    too much of a temptation for Ireland to just focus on the south."

    the Polish-German war really hasn’t kicked off yet has it? I’m beginning to think
    that the Poles declared war on Hitler purely on principle. \nTo the west, France
    seems content to just sit tight and grow a bigger and stronger. Some interesting
    play for Napoleon, who has been quite quiet for a while now. I can only hope that
    they’re planning something big. Something aimed distinctly eastward.\nRome is
    still clinging on to existence, albeit barely. Spartan pikemen are pouring towards
    Cumae, and the presence of a few triremes tickling the side of the capital serves
    as a reminder to the Roman Empire that their days are numbered."

    decide to sign a ten turn non-aggression pact, which includes any and all name

  narration: Those Filipinos, man! Whilst Toowoomba, for now, appears to be once again
    firmly in Henry Parkes’ (of Australia) grip, they’ve instead directed their attention
    to the nearby Hawaiian city of Kaneohe. With three ranged ships, a lack of Hawaiian
    defense and a trireme on the way, it seems like another sure conquest for the
    Philippines. It’s definitely worth mentioning that the largely overlooked nation
    is bringing some real intrigue and gumption into the Oceanic theatre. It’s a lot
    of fun to watch.

    dropped in. Despite the fact that the Sioux have lost Wahkepute to the remotely
    competent Mexican army, the loss shouldn’t prove to be too much of a dent. The
    mountain range to the immediate east allows for a very narrow funnel for enemy
    troops, one that could easily be blocked, and compared to the rest of Sitting
    Bull’s cities, he could have fared a lot worse. The Blackfoot invasion to the
    north appears to have been largely rebuffed. \nFor now."

    threats just became that much scarier. In regards to the front with Brazil, nothing

With the superior naval technology, they may not have too much of a problem rebuffing the western invasion.

    China, probably sick of being kicked around, dedicates ninety percent of their forces to capture the nearby city of Tabriz. They don’t really seem to have a lot of boots on the ground, but the technology at the very least is fairly sound. The only hitch in their brilliant plan is that they’ve left their southern front door defenseless against an army of stronger, bigger and nastier Vietnamese army.
    And they’re just about to knock.

Sometimes it helps if you use them! The Moroccans also appear to have forgotten how to War Good, dallying around in the desert doing bugger all.
    Someone who doesn’t need any encouragement is Leonidas (of the Spartans), who in a fit of enlightenment and enthusiasm decides to send a crack suicide squad of a trireme and a pikeman directly into the heart of Roman territory. Points for originality.

    In a surprising development, impressively Sitting Bull manages to reacquire Wahpekute from the Mexican forces. As to how long he’ll be able to be King of this particular hill is anybody’s guess, but the fact is it proves the Sioux’s survivability thus far has been insane.
    The Blackfoot offensive to the north also appears to have been completely and utterly devastated, with no territory changing hands.

    Wake up!
    For real, looking at army and city sizes, I can’t help but think that the Yakutia are becoming a little bit irrelevant. It’s not too late to invade the Mongols guys!
    Like most of you, I actually really want to see an active, aggressive Yakutia state, as I feel that would utterly change the entire Asian geopolitical dynamic, and potentially halt the Inuit expansion in their tracks. But alas, no, they’re more content to sit twiddling their thumbs and go on about how good at building big things they are.

    the Spartans, Soviets or Polish ever think to casually pop over for there for

    have really embraced the ideologies of Communism and Marxism and has marked the
    occasion by producing an absolute shedload of workers, who literally run all along
    the Polish and Finnish borders. But hey, they’re all equal, it’s just that a couple

    The ongoing Hunnic-Finnish tug of war continues! With, ironically, Stalin’s moral support, the Finns do a sterling job of taking the city of San Bartolo from Attila. This actually poses a serious problem for the barbaric leader, who now finds an enemy that has direct access to his capital. “You’re Finnished!” shouts a Scandinavian general happily, repeating his catchphrase for the forty-third time that day.

    one place in the world that you really don’t want to live, it’s here. Aside from
    being stuck in the middle of the frozen wasteland, it also suffers from being
    trapped between four expanding empires, who for the most part really don’t seem
    to want to play nice. After just about getting used to the notion of living under
    the Blackfoot, the Inuit are all like “Hell no!” and launch an invasion of the
    city, and with the troop levels they’ve committed it sure looks likely that once
    again, it will fall.

    Lastly, we come to the data slides.
    The first thing I noticed when comparing this to the last available set, (part 9), was that the ongoing wars against Sitting Bull may be taking their toll. The Sioux’ population slips from a very impressive fifth place to twelfth. Whilst this isn’t the biggest crisis a nation has seen, they are going to have to fight boldly, work hard, and engage in more hanky-panky in order to ensure that they stay a powerful regional, and eventual global player.
    Other than that things are largely consistent, with Texas continuing to hold the top spot followed by Canada, Yakutia and Australia. Brazil has also advanced a couple of points, coming from ninth to fifth.

    going to find that it has a lot more competition going forwards.

    And absolutely finally, we have the ever prettier looking religion map. The major creeds appear for the most part to have settled comfortably with one majority per continent. Judaism is set to expand further into Western Europe (including the Nazis. Lololololol), while Oriental Orthodoxy dominates Africa in its entirety. Tibet’s brainchild, Akkat-u, finds itself in a powerful position to the east, although it shouldn’t ignore the rises of Shinto and Buddhism respectively, if they wish to remain on top.
    Poor Islam, with a holy city sandwiched between two others, it really seems condemned to snuff out in this particular world.
    Well, that’s it guys! I really hope that everybody had as much fun reading this as I did writing it. Thanks once again to the main man u/Tpangolin for letting me annotate this part – there were a lot of really interesting and cool developments that were a great laugh to write about. Until the next time folks, Cheerio!
