  narration: "Welcome back to the Civilization Battle Royale! Today we have gathered
    for the weekly ritual of F5-ing (though a bit later than usual), posting riot
    threads so the moderators can delete them to clean up spam and then reading what
    has changed in the world of the Battle Royale! Your narrator for today is /u/TA_Knight
    (Again) and I hope to bring you an enjoyable experience!\nNow, a few words first:\n
    \nThis part is shorter than the usual, as Tpangolin is having difficulties catching
    up in recording the Battle Royale. With several crashes and solving the issue
    with the Boers, TPangolin worked extra hours to bring you this part on time. This
    narration may be a bit rushed, as I only received the album today, but I hope
    this will not subtract from your experience. Lets get right into it, shall we?"

  narration: Last part didn‘t see too many changes as Sparta had difficulty attacking
    Armenia, Mexico was struggling to pass though the peacekeeping forces on Blackfoot.
    However, these who worry this part will see even less chance, don‘t ;)

  narration: "The Boers are still #1 thanks to their immense tech lead. The slide
    mentions concern about losing their advantage sine they are almost at the tech
    cap, but i believe they will still have a an advantage thanks to all the powerful
    wonders they have gotten so far.\n \nThe full Power Rankings can be found at https://imgur.com/a/WjSPb/layout/horizontal/"

  narration: The Canadian resistance is no more. The Inuit flip an entire row of cities
    as they crash the pathetic Canadians in their path to victory. Canada‘s only hope
    is to flip a city enough times with naval units, allowing them to drag the war
    long enough for the Inuit to peace out. However, judging from the size of the
    Canadian navy in the sea, they will have to pray hard to make it work.

  narration: Albany to the south flips again, however that city is even more of a
    lost cause than others, since Canada has to move their ships around Buccaneer
    territory to get to the city. Better let that city go and focus on a city more
    reachable by sea, like Vancouver.

  narration: "The Blackfoot are pounded by the Mexican army, surviving only due to
    their Vietnamese and Australian peacekeepers. What once was a proud, though small,
    paratrooper carpet, became a pathetic defensive force due to the narrow core and
    the heavily citadeled cities who could not keep up producing units to make up
    for the loss. \nAt least they can build Advanced Destroyers now, maybe they can
    use them to harass the Mexican shore?"

  narration: While the Chinese Knight goes Waterborne, Sparta attempts to open a new
    front with Armenia, taking Tigranocerta to red. Frankly, I‘m surprised that Armenia
    still exists, as they certainly dont have any units to spare. Sparta doesnt seem
    to use the full power of their military, leaving their main force in Europe. Time
    will show whether that was a good decision.

  narration: "As the world is torn apart in gruesome wars, the Boers keep on wonder
    hoarding, building the Bionic Tower. This wonder must be built in a coastal city,
    and gives +2 culture, +1 gold and +1 production to every sea tile in the city
    working range, as well as a fishing boat. Not too impressive of a wonder but will
    allow the Boers to churn out units oh slightly more faster.\n \nInformation about
    the wonder can be found at http://i.imgur.com/GQH1hLT.jpg"

  narration: "You haven‘t forgot about Morocco, didnt you? Well, the Buccaneers didnt.
    The Buccaneers take out Tangier with a Mobile SAM, putting an end to the Moroccan
    legacy, and eliminating them at 31st place.\n \nMorocco was always one of the
    weaker civilizations on the BR, and never had much to show for themselves. While
    every civilization around them declared full scale wars and conquered entire empires,
    Morocco was content with taking defenseless cities, like the Ashanti capital,
    the Portuguese city of Braga, and the two remaining cities of Carthage. All well
    and good, but once an actual empire like the Buccaneers rolled around, Morocco
    crumpled like cardboard."

  narration: 3 Armenian cities are awaiting capture, but Sparta seems to be waiting
    for something. Maybe they are afraid of allowing Persia out? Persia, though, has
    their own problems to deal with, as it seems that a batch of Mongolian troops
    have taken a lesson from the Boers, and transported into Persian lands, adding
    on to the Ethiopian peacekeepers, and essentially disallowing Persia to move.
- scene_number: "11"

  narration: "One of the last Moroccan units can be spotted on the Ethiopian-Boer
    borders, next to Lake Victoria. Unfortunately, Lake Victoria is no Fountain of
    Youth, and drinking from it will not heal the Moroccan Empire and revive it once
    more.\n \nFinland to the north is still bombing Arabia, but has little to show
    for it except some black bars above certain cities."
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene12.jpg
  narration: Canada attempts to flip some cities back, like Washington, Kingston and
    Halfax, but the Inuit take all the cities back, and add Albany and Fort Rouille
    on top of it. Canada now has 5 cities left, meaning that the end is near.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene13.jpg
  narration: As a gesture of peace, Canada peaces out with Sri Lanka. Now that Canada
    knows what is it like to be the rump state, Canada realizes the suffering of so
    many states among the Cylinder. Sadly, its too late. Way too late.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene14.jpg
  narration: The Boers see the Buccaneers, who just eliminated Morocco, and decide
    to... Actually, they plot against Ethiopia instead. I begin to think the Boers
    actually like warmongers.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene15.jpg
  narration: The Canadian force is dwindling, only managing to flip Albany and Vancouver.
    Meanwhile, the Inuit, not used to only one war at a time, plot against Morocco.
    Too bad Morocco is already dead.
- scene_number: "16"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene16.jpg
  narration: "Sparta takes Jerusalem again, and it looks like they may be able to
    keep it this time, as Armenia decided to batch all their units around Artashat
    for some reason.\n \nAlso, it seems that Ethiopia has citadeled Alexandria, likely
    angry at the fact that Sparta owns land on Africa. The Indonesian scout makes
    landfall on Africa, anticipating this war and preparing to help Sparta against
    Ethiopia, like they helped against Sweden. Sparta themselves do not seem to be
    aware, though."
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene17.jpg
  narration: Buccaneer South America continues to be devoid of units, and it looks
    even emptier than before. When the Buccaneers finally held a significant land
    area, i thought that the Buccaneers would start manufacturing land units to cover
    up their sole weakness at that time. Instead, they doubled down on it. Have the
    Buccaneers lost their charm?
- scene_number: "18"

  narration: Sparta surrounds Tigranocerta with Helicopter Gunships, forgetting, like
    a few narrators before me, that helicopters cant take cities. Work smarter, not
    harder, Leonidas!
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene19.jpg
  narration: The Inuit fell Vancouver, Edmonton and Hamilton, leaving Canada an assortment
    of cities on the eastern shore. Canada has a few dozen destroyers still, but,
    unlike when the Inuit took Texas, the Canadian army has to defend a much bigger
    amount of cities. I dont hold high hopes for them managing to keep a city until
    peace.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene20.jpg
  narration: Mexico peaces out with the Blackfoot, deciding that fighting them is
    a lost cause due to all the peacekeeper forces blocking war efforts. The task
    of removing the Blackfoot from existence will have to wait for another part.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene21.jpg
  narration: The USSR reaches the Atomic Era! Stalin shows the other leaders that
    even a rump state dog can learn new tricks. Although, that trick is pretty much
    ‘flip a city before we die completely‘ which can really only impress the city
    states on the cylinder.

  narration: "Australia now has High-Energy Research Centers! These are basically
    Academies that were upgraded by the Particle Accelerator wonder, and now give
    double the science output. This may not seem much, but..\n \nThe Particle Accelerator
    is a National Wonder.\n \nYes, to build this wonder, Australia had to build a
    laboratory in every each of their 100+ cities, JUST to build this wonder. No wonder
    that Australia has managed to ascend the tech leaderboards so fast.\n \nMore information
    about the wonder can be found at http://i.imgur.com/Ewwtj7U.jpg"

  narration: "Among the wreckage of the Canadian empire, a special Inuit unit can
    be spotted.. The Biotrooper.\n \nThe Biotrooper is the endgame of the Infantry
    units. It has 120 strength, 3 movement, March promotion (which heals 10 per turn),
    and a whole slew of other bonuses thanks to the Geoengineered promotion. One of
    these bonuses is ability to cross mountains. Mexico, be afraid. Be very afraid.\n

  narration: Albany, Kingston and Medicine Hat all fall, relocating the capital to
    Sherbrooke, who is already on zero health and a melee unit is beside the city.
    By the next turn, Canada will be no longer able to manufacture units, and will
    have to rely on their remaining navy.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene25.jpg
  narration: "Its World Congress time, and gems are banned. Due to the resource distribution
    of the map, and the fact that civilizations like to ban all the resources they
    don‘t own, i expect about all luxuries to be banned by the end of the game. Not
    that Deity AI will ever care.\n \nPersia peaces out with Sparta, having enough
    of waiting for Sparta to come. Quite sad, i would‘ve enjoyed this war. Oh well.
    Sparta at least smartened up enough to stop surrounding Tigranocerta with Helicopter
    Gunships, and allowing their paratroopers to have a crack at the city.\n \nAlso,
    Canada retakes Vancouver in the background."

  narration: Mexico attempts to pass Catholicism as world religion again, but fails
    yet again. They will need to convert many more civilizations to Catholicism before
    they can succeed.

  narration: "Vietnam plots against Persia, as they look like an easy meat to kill.
    Good luck getting past all these peacekeeper forces though.\n \nThe Inuit take
    Sherbrooke and Vancouver, leaving Canada only one city that hasn‘t flipped yet."

  narration: Sparta finally takes Tigraocerta! Hooray! Only 10 turns more than necessary.
    Can they crush Armenia now?
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene29.jpg
  narration: Canada strikes the eastern shore with all their remaining forces, taking
    Medicine Hat, Hamilton and Vancouver all at once. They are not going to give up
    easily. However, they have less than 10 destroyers left, so they will not be able
    to keep it up for much longer.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene30.jpg
  narration: I know a lot of you heard about the Boer problem where they weren‘t able
    to build Future Worlds improvements, due to their worker UU preventing usage of
    modded improvements. TPangolin has heard your pleas, and replaced all Boer workers
    with normal workers, allowing them to build Future Worlds improvements once again.
    Here, we see a Mutacology, a farm replacement that also gives production and culture,
    and thanks to the Pholus Mutagen, also damages nearby enemy units by 10 HP per
    turn! Truly a modern beauty.
- scene_number: "31"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene31.jpg
  narration: "With one mighty strike, All remaining Canadian cities fall to the Inuit.
    Canada still has 5 destroyers left, but i think we can count them out already,
    and declare them eliminated at 30th place.\n \nCanada was one of the more powerful
    empires, even being #1 for a short while, and had a vast empire composed of many
    cities. However, they stagnated. Where the superpowers of today conquered entire
    civilizations to grow in power, Canada was instead involved in failed wars against
    America and Texas. when they finally cracked America, who at the time was simply
    too weak to fight back, the Inuit striked. Then, it was too late for Canada, and
    they were barred from a chance of victory forever.\n \nAs one war ends, another
    war starts... Ethiopia and the Boers declare war on Arabia! Oh boy.."

  narration: "The Boers had access to them for a while, but in case you have forgotten,
    here is the Chimera.\n \nThe Chimera is, for a lack of a better comparison, a
    scout unit. It has 80 strength, rather weak for the era, but 4 movement, and they
    don‘t suffer movement penalties crossing hills or rivers. This, along with the
    usual bioline abilities of rapid healing and geoengineering, makes them an impressive
    alternative for tanks when blitzing cities. Thanks to the Skynet wonder, they
    can even take on a Mech Infantry one on one and win.\n \nMore information on this
    unit can be found at http://i.imgur.com/6GJDx2R.jpg"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene33.jpg
  narration: Despite the high tech of Australia, they still dont seem to be upgrading
    their units. They have a massive carpet of Diggers, despite having access to Drone
    UAVs, Advanced Destroyers, Bazookas and Mech Infantry. Perhaps they have so many
    units they simply cant afford upgrading them all. In which case, a big war (like
    against Vietnam) should suffice to recycle their units, replacing them with upgraded
    versions.

  narration: |-
    The Moroccan musketman and the Ashanti pikeman can be seen side by side in their respective lakes. Morocco has the strength advantage, and should they declare war, they should be able to conquer the Ashanti lake easily. They will first need to deal with the Boer peacekeeping forces, however.
    Also of note: Ethiopian Helicopter Gunships on top of the Natural Wonders!
- scene_number: "35"

  narration: Ethiopia has no patience for things such as stagnated wars, flipped cities
    or resistance. Using their forces stationed at Persia, they strike Arabia from
    both sides, crashing them. Mecca, Najran and Kufah immediately fall, while Medina
    and Khurasan are surrounded.
- scene_number: "36"

  narration: A more zoomed out image shows just how screwed Arabia is as they are
    attacked from all sides. To the North, Sparta apparently got their shit together
    finally, as they took Hebron, and prepare to attack Gaza.
- scene_number: "37"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene37.jpg
  narration: The last Canadian destroyer is next to Hamilton, allowing Canada to flip
    a city one last time before becoming a ghost fleet. At least, unlike the Kongo,
    they can actually escape into sea and not simply be target practice by their former
    cities.

  narration: Persia peaces out with Afghanistan, declaring the attack on Kabul failed,
    due to Finnish peacekeeping forces. Afghanistan is finally at peace, and can focus
    on (trying) to rebuild their cities.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part60-scene39.jpg
  narration: It appears that Sparta was indeed afraid of Persia, as now that Persia
    is out, Sparta finally brings an acceptable amount of troops to the front. Gaza
    falls to red while Gyumri starts to take damage, and the single Armenian plane
    just cant keep up with the amount of Spartans hitting the shore.

  narration: 'Its been a while since we saw a significant part of Sibir, and we see
    that they have carpeted well, especially since they are #2 in actual land tiles.
    They will need to get more modern land units, though. Paratroopers just dont cut
    it.'

    Arabia takes back Medina and Najran, however this is a mere tick for Ethiopia, as they already surround Barsa and Damascus, systematically destroying all Arabian opposition.
    Ethiopia squashes Arabia like a bug, leaving them two cities remaining, Bethlehem and Jericho, and Bethlehem is already Bethtoast.

    Gene Template. This wonder provides +1 production, gold and science per 3 population
    units in the empire. Its a very significant wonder, and will allow the Boers to
    lock down the remaining wonders for themselves as well as carpet even faster should
    they go into another war.\n \nMore information on this wonder can be found at

  narration: Ah, Hawaii. Its a wonder they even survived this far. It seems that Hawaii
    was embargoed, as they have a lot of cargo ships but they aren‘t using them, effectively
    denying all gold generation from the city state.

  narration: The Canadian navy scatters, abandoning Canada and taking on a new goal,

  narration: Not much changes in South America, but the Buccaneers upgrade their Mech
    Infantry to Power Armor Infantry. Brazil appears to suffer from the same problem
    as Finland, since they are also only fielding Paratroopers, however, in this case,
    its a good thing, as unlike the neighbors of Finland, the Buccaneers and Chile
    have no land army, allowing Paratroopers to be used for devastating effect.

  narration: The Vietnamese-Korean border is tense as ever since the last war between
    them, but no side dares to strike, not wanting to lose ground. Vietnam has the
    production, while Korea has the military tech, and a conflict between them will
    be especially bloody.

    eliminated next turn, or the turn after that if the Arabian PAI has a chance to
    flip the city.
