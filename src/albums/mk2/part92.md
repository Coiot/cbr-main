  narration: Hello there everyone, this is /u/LunarNeedle and I‘m here in assistance
    with Blue Cassette to bring you the long awaited part 92 of the Civilization Battle
    Royale. This shitpost was brought to us by gamer29475 on behalf of Spongebob.
    However, instead of celebrating a beautiful song, he celebrated as Boer’s absolutely
    ravaged Vietnam, potentially bringing this game slightly closer to resolution.
    At this I would provide some kind of summary of the coming part but I really cannot
    do this part justice... I really can‘t. Buckle your seatbelts guys, we‘re hitting
    plaid.

  narration: Here we can directly compare differences to see what exactly happened
    last part. We see a few cities nuked off the face of the earth. A new city was
    settled, named Jyvaskyla, just south of Nedong and next to Antioch. We also saw
    Artashat, Ecbatana, Persepolis and Gordium all flip orange, while another city
    just off of frame gets settled right beneath Helsinki. Also we see some tiles
    exchanged in aggressive citadelling. Remember folks, citadelling in Civ is actually
    a terrible diplomatic modifier and Sweden did it twice to Sibir. Could this be
    an indicator of chaos to follow?

  narration: The famous /u/ASphericalMelon map but now enhanced with puppeted lands
    you can see how each and every area has been treated by their owner. More notably,
    we see a puppeted Sweden, which considering the mic drop in the last part might
    not be a good thing. Boers also have a surprisingly high amount of puppeted cities,
    as does Australia, so we‘ll have to wait for a full and total annexation of such
    cities to reach peak condition.

  narration: 'The famous Glycolysis, famous for having five alts banned on Discord
    yet being a rather hilariously opinionated Discord staff member. Fresh off of
    the falling of Dvin, he has decided to create a hill and mountain map showing
    the terrain difficulties ahead for the Boer offensive. As we can see from the
    severe amount of hills and mountains in the Viet core, should Boers reach deep
    enough to pass the Middle East and border Sri Lanka, they’ll have a far easier
    time pushing into the core... provided they don’t get lost in the Tibetan mountains
    trying to #FreeTibet. Go for the dream, Kruger.'

  narration: Fun fact, I wrote this slide before the Power Rankers released their
    part and for good reason. Can anyone even question Boer‘s dominance now? So instead
    of detailing why Boer‘s are running away with this game, I‘d like to point a spotlight
    at how bad everyone else is doing. Inuit isn‘t doing anything despite weak neighbours,
    Brazil isn‘t building a navy despite their only threats being naval, Vietnam is
    still building drone UAV‘s and finally the war between Sibir and Vietnam has been
    going on for so long that we had to cull the images of the conflict as to not
    have Dawkinzz die from liver failure.

  narration: Munich immediately takes damage from the war announced last part. We
    also see damage cross over to the other side, but it doesn‘t seem to amount in
    much. We might see Munich flip, but the main focus is on the Iceland-Sweden meat
    grinder on top. What worries me isn‘t the lack of units in this shot, but the
    lack of planes, which will make melee engages far far easier.

  narration: Armenian soldiers watch as Tigranocerta flips to being Icelandic with
    small chance of flipping back, lovely Boer-der gore appearing in the process.
    Good job Boers. Messene also flips, but this one seems to be temporary. I expect
    Constantinople to flip many times in the future.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene08.jpg
  narration: It seems that Vietnam is forming a strong wall against Boers here, but
    I doubt the longevity of this front. Good usage of planes in the former Persian
    capital means that cities will be flipping and fast. Once Kabul and Samarkand
    fall, it might be time to consider Vietnam toast as a world power.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene09.jpg
  narration: Oh hey, nice strip of flat desert you have. That must be nice. But in
    other words, look at all those specialist slots being used. I wonder if they might
    turn that flatland desert into a commercial hub. What would they sell? The dreams
    of an empire or a lot (and I mean a lot) of sand. Nobody knows.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene10.jpg
  narration: Fatehpur Sikri is actually a really nice city all things considered.
    200 science from one city and fifty production isn‘t nothing to sneeze at. The
    Future Era improvements are also coming in, so it‘ll be awhile before this city
    becomes strong. It‘s just a shame that they are so far behind that they aren‘t
    a player, but I know someone would happily take this city from their hands.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene11.jpg
  narration: However, in order to be an empire, you have to be this tall to ride.
    This is the bare minimum an empire‘s cities needs to be for their owner to be
    considered a world power. Now, if only they could be producing literally anything
    but infrastructure before they become Australias digger dumping ground. However,
    that seems to be in the south, as if they‘re planning something!
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene12.jpg
  narration: Hovd meanwhile is what you want to avoid. Sure, it has a modicum of production,
    it‘s losing citizens to the Great Famine that will hurt them more. He needs to
    trade tiles with other cities now to recover this city to its former glory.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene13.jpg
  narration: Helsinki meanwhile is suffering from a greater plague. This once capital
    is suffering from the amount of science and gold it‘s needlessly producing. I
    know AI doesn‘t like to rebuild improvements, but now is the time. Ditch the gold
    and culture and get food ASAP. Wait, I just realized I‘m giving advice to an AI.
    I need to stop.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene14.jpg
  narration: Opting to move to the lesser used cities in the major empires might help
    us reveal what‘s in the minds of these madmen. Although, I don‘t think we‘ll need
    to wait long.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene15.jpg
  narration: AS NATIONAL HERITAGE SITES AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION WILL BE DELIBERATED!
    YES!... Oh wait, that‘s not big deal in this image is it?
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene16.jpg
  narration: As the mic just got dropped. Henry “The Hammer” Parkes has opted to enact
    judgement in front of thousands of viewers on the Battle Royale Network! Vigan
    itself reels back from the pain, containing all the one plane in this shot, presumably
    planned to be sent towards the encroaching Boer menace. Remember that time I said
    that Vietnam was dead if they lost Kabul? Yeah, that time has come and passed.
    They will just have to weather the storm.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene17.jpg
  narration: To weather the storm, you need insulation, and considering their army
    of submarines, it seems likely that they will weather attacks from the south.
    However, you cannot forget the Diggers to the north and the assault from southern
    Japan. This will truly test the Trung sisters‘ war prowess. Now, just declare
    war on the Kimberly so they can get out of your country, and the Blackfoot too.
    Actually, yeah. This might be harder than even I thought...
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene18.jpg
  narration: Fighting the Kimberly would be a death errand. While it could be close,
    it‘d almost certainly mean one front would collapse. You cannot get those Kimberly
    out, you have to accept them for now Trungs. It‘s actually amazing to think that
    if they fought they could expand their empire, or take down a once top tier world
    power. That‘s a scary, yet amusing thought.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene19.jpg
  narration: But what are we dealing with here? Things have changed since their last
    conflict has occurred. Namely the size, considering Australia‘s jawdropping production
    and military size. If they devote their full self to this war, this could be a
    bloodbath. You might laugh thinking that, and indeed you might laugh thinking
    this might not happen but remember—all biases are randomized to a certain extent.
    Let‘s just hope that Australia rolled high.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene20.jpg
  narration: With a drop in land area, Vietnam represents a solid fourth place Civilization,
    with an impressive amount of trade route and a huge amount of gold, they could
    buy their way to survival if they play their cards right. There is a way they
    could actually turn on Australia and potentially carve a way inwards while Boer‘s
    get exhausted in the meat grinder of former Afghanistan. R-Right?
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene21.jpg
  narration: Oh... About that... There‘s a good chance that we might see the Great
    Vietnamese Partition from all sides. That‘s a large enough land army to actually
    delete the armies around Rach Hia and Hoa Lu and possibly take them with this
    along. Henry Parkes just has to hope that the Open Borders agreement with Sejong
    doesn‘t expire as he does it.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene22.jpg
  narration: Okay, this is ridiculous. This front may be small, but we could be seeing
    a five front war. Two stealth attacks from Australia to the north, an aerial and
    naval assault in Southern Japan, a frontal assault right in front of the Vietnamese
    core and the great Boer offensive to the west. The question is, which wall will
    crumble first?
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene23.jpg
  narration: As the turn progresses, we see this fragile front evaporate like water
    in a flashpan, as Ghazni and Gordium see their health in the red as even the first
    sign of blood at Samarkand already shows. It seems that Australia will need to
    act fast, or we might be seeing Hanoi fly more orange colours sooner than anticipated.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene24.jpg
  narration: Enjoying Tigranocerta and Constantinople, Iceland? Well say your last
    words because it seems like your grip on them will only last briefly. Speaking
    of losing grip, Messene is firmly in the hands of the angered Ingolfur Arnarson
    and most likely for good. In fact, the good news for Sweden ends here, with strong
    offenses on the mainland. It seems the flashpan of conflict will exist on the
    extensive European land border and the naval front between the Icelandic Isles
    and Swedish core. Excitement is brewing.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene25.jpg
  narration: With the war front pushing past Cologne and towards Hamburg on land it
    seems that Iceland for now has the advantage, but it‘s hard to say if that‘s from
    the ground troops or the 6 planes stationed in Neapolis. In the navy however,
    it seems to be the opposite but it‘s still far too close to tell. I wouldn‘t be
    surprised if this navy was completely bare in a few turns.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene26.jpg
  narration: Blackfoot and Buccs are livid as the declaration of war is targeted towards
    their Southern competitor instead of themselves! I‘m not going to lie in saying
    the potential for this is great, especially considering how massive the navies
    are. It‘s just the stubborn fact that Buccaneers are preventing this from being
    a bloodbath. It‘ll take a chunk of the Inuit Ice Sheet Fleet to unlodge and ram
    into the undefended Brazilian coast for any damage to come of this war. For now,
    keep your eyes on Port Royale, as a declaration of war on them could spell the
    unification of the Americas.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene27.jpg
  narration: The Inuit submarines merely watch Tulum, knowing that without a melee
    unit, it‘s impossible to capture that city. They just watch and plan the decorations
    for their new city. Should the turret go there, or should that be remade into
    a game room? Decisions, decisions. In other news, it seems that Australia has
    open borders with their once rival. What is Parkes planning that he hasn‘t already
    enacted?
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene28.jpg
  narration: The Kimberly are doing their best to ensure someone from Australia makes
    landfall. Without melee units to protect, these cities are practically defenseless.
    Australia will need to use their airforce, and well, to damage these cities or
    cut through the endless array of empty carriers and subs. Although, amusingly,
    the Kimberly existing is causing a submarine with nuclear capabilities to be stranded
    off the coast of Amaravati. Well played Kimberly, well played.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene29.jpg
  narration: "‘Ramming into the wall with enough heads should work‘, justifies the
    tired two- hundreth Digger core as they ram tirelessly into Rach Gia. I would
    just say something about ranged units and air power, but I think I‘m spinning
    tires here. You keep on doing you, Digger carpet. You do you."
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene30.jpg
  narration: Iceland makes gains! It seems that Tegea is firmly in the hands of Iceland
    as the armies could march towards Lodz and Corinth and deplete the little airforce
    they have. This city could flip a few more times, but at this point, it might
    be best to draw the battlelines here. This is a surprisingly good usage of the
    Icelandic military, already flipping two cities in this area of the cylinder alone.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene31.jpg
  narration: I told you bro. I told you about the airforce bro. With this array of
    bombers, it seems unlikely any Swedish city in this part of the world will remain
    in green health, comfortably laying waste to Munich already and not even sweating
    the assault on Cologne as Hamburg takes damage. Meanwhile in naval warfare, Sweden
    tried ramming ships like it was World of Warships, but unfortunately for them
    that doesn‘t work here, isolating majority of their damage and some nuclear capacity
    to the icy fleet.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene32.jpg
  narration: Our golden age has ended? Ha. Please. It‘s just begun as Tygyn Darkhan
    has won the in-game Rap Royale and has passed the microphone down to the sub.
    Will you be a contender? In other words, Korea has a military again! At least
    here... kinda...
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene33.jpg
  narration: How? I mean, points for effort, but how did they snipe Thi Li Bi Nai
    from Vietnam? It seems like they can hold this as well, considering the absolutely
    pitiful amount of melee units anywhere near here. Ambon also looks to fall as
    the Amaravati, a tactical location to store all of Vietnam‘s planes. Taking the
    Amaravati airforce would definitely hurt the campaign against well, everyone that
    their fending off right now. Send them to the Boer meatgrinder now, or face penalties
    later. Also, hey, Kimberly. Attack. Like now. Please?
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene34.jpg
  narration: More shots of this area is always nice as I see actual gains here for
    Vietnam if they play their cards right. Exposed air force aside, this seems to
    be great for the conflict. If Vigan is the point of landfall, it‘s over for Vietnam
    as there is melee units and air force to support them. A rare combination means
    cities can flip and fast. However, slowing that remains a decent army widdling
    away at the advanced Future World melee units knocking on Vigan‘s door. Can Australia
    into land?
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene35.jpg
  narration: They can into other people land at least. I can see that Korea is building
    a military, in fact their building it as fast as possible, filling out lands and
    stacking units in city as they desperately hope that Bach Gia remains the resting
    ground of the Digger Hoard. But, looking at it, not many of these are Diggers,
    in fact, they‘re all respectable units. If they make their way towards Vigan,
    they could actually punch into the empire. Stop watching anime and go fight. Weebs,
    the lot of ‘em.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene36.jpg
  narration: Self deprecating humor aside, we can see why the Boer‘s are winning,
    they have a strong air fo-... Wait, that‘s not an air force, that‘s nukes? Oh
    boy. The walls of Jerico fell last part, so now the walls of everywhere will fall
    by nuclear power alone. If they can use this power, they can utterly devastate
    Vietnam‘s core and cities one happy nuke at a time. The Worker bot army is following
    closely behind to clean up the “accidental” spills of nuclear material.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene37.jpg
  narration: I‘ve seen a tank here in Batticaloa for so long, I actually think this
    is just what the tank does. Practicing with the refugees of nations once strong.
    In other words, I just realized Baghdad flipped. That‘s actually good news for
    Vietnam, as flipping cities is what prevented a total wipe of Buccaneers off Africa.
    Keep on flipping till the end of time Vietnam. Not just for you, but for the game.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene38.jpg
  narration: While it seems that Constantinople might remain in the tired hands of
    Iceland or Sweden, the core of Europe is starting to tremble and move in the way
    of Iceland and with a rather empty core. It seems that if they can cut through
    this attack, they might be able to take Europe whole. I love my Sweden dearly,
    but unless Gustavus Adolphus pulls a miracle play, he could lose all the hard
    gains he acquired. A truly Icelandic move to capitalize on another armies weakness
    from previous conquest to conquest himself. Once it was Ireland after the war
    with England, then it was France after France tried fighting everyone and now
    it‘s Sweden after Finland. If they have the troops, perhaps their aiming to march
    on Sibir, which would lead to an empire that might be able to take down the Boers.
    Maybe? Probably not.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene39.jpg
  narration: Reading off page 44 on How To Fight Wars Good, he sent his boats in to
    ram Submarines and Battleships. Immediately regretting that decision, he moves
    his army back which might be to his detriment. Now he leaves his Western flank
    imposed to a still existent navy which could potentially flip-... actually nevermind.
    Both of these armies are already spent and have been for awhile now. Now it relies
    on the usage of every available resource they have, even distraction carriers
    if need be, to win this war.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene40.jpg
  narration: Sweden might be mildly undefended, but they have the means to unleash
    a submarine based terror on the Icelandic fleet. It looks actually kinda humorous
    to have them up there all in the ice. It‘s like they‘re planning to use the ice
    against the self-proclaimed land of ice. If only they weren’t so far away. Next
    time Adolphus, use the military. That‘ll truly spook them.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene41.jpg
  narration: Don‘t think of it. Don‘t you dare go out in a blaze of glory. You know
    that now with their navy, the Boer menace can easily paint Cuba orange. Although,
    that happening would cause a dog-pile collapse by Inuit and Brazil, which might
    be what‘s needed to unify the Americas so it might not be that bad? In another
    note, imagine if Boer‘s had Diggers. Look at all those workers that can become
    useless crappy units. If there is a Mk3, it‘ll need to cap these workers, because
    all of these units are definitely adding to the turn times.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene42.jpg
  narration: O-Oh my, that‘s... I said this was going to be a good part, but could
    Inuit be planning a Korean takeover? Look at all the units nearby the border here
    as well as that impressive bombing carpet. Maybe that‘s why their military is
    all here. Perhaps this area will explode in the coming turns. All I know is that
    if it happens, it will be glorious.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene43.jpg
  narration: Thi Li Bi Nai remains Australia for now, but a nearby Giant Death Robot
    wants to say hello. A few cities, namely My Son and Ambon, are in the red, but
    without Vietnamese units, it seems unlikely that there will be any more sweet
    gains on the front with all the peacekeepers in the way. Hawaii confirmed puppetmaster
    of Australia, Kimberly and Blackfoot. You heard it here first.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene44.jpg
  narration: I didn‘t believe my lying eyes but I could‘ve sworn it happened. Holy
    hell. Australia made beachhead and with their amount of troops pouring it, it
    seems like this city might flip a lot, but it seems likely to hold. Just off the
    left side of the image there is Hanoi and if this blitz Is successful, we could
    be seeing an Australian foothold. Australia can into land. They can. But for how
    long?
- scene_number: "45"

    utter destruction of Vietnam as a whole. Stop building all infrastructure now
    Trungs. Henry‘s knockin‘.

  narration: As Baghdad falls, Gordium flips for one turn. It seems that while the
    tactic of annoying the Boers is working. Samarkand and Lashkar Gar are in the
    yellow while the first bombing raids over Isfahhan slowly drop the HP.
- scene_number: "47"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part92-scene47.jpg
  narration: This war was a mistake. Gaining Constantinople is one thing but Corrinth
    is in yellow. Adrianople is starting to take damage and the defense around Munich
    trembles to the oncoming advance. At this point, I could see Sibir potentially
    make gains against Sweden as well due to Vietnam being busy. Things are looking
    dire Adolphus, you need to act and fast to keep the dream of an Swedish Europe
    alive.

  narration: The navy has evaporated like I presumed while the warfront is too close
    to call here. It seems like Sweden isn‘t doing so great from the unit HP. It seems
    like Munich will fall soon with Hamburg falling over shortly after but it can
    easily go the other way.

  narration: Alas, the part comes to a close. It feels so short for me, as I joined
    narrating when I had to deal with a 90+ slide monster and before the CivBattleRoyale
    I had to do a 110+ slide nightmare for the Lurking Royale. But that‘s not to say
    this part has been boring. In fact I say the opposite. What you see grayed out
    behind you should summarize why this part has been one of the best easily since
    the reboot. Australia might be looking to carve out a foothold in Vietnam, and
    with their insane unit production as seen here, could potentially challenge the
    Boer carpet they‘ll soon no doubt border. They could then forge an attack on Korea
    and Mongolia and actually flip the east to being all Green and Gold. The fate
    of the game lies in the success, or lack thereof, from Mongolia, Sibir and Korea‘s
    part as giving either the Boers or Australia that land could mean the world for
    this game. Either way you look at it, this part will be the part that changed
    the entire game.

  narration: Although, when it comes to production, it‘s a battle of Boers versus
    the Inuit. And for good reason, they both have neighbors with far weaker production
    and a far smaller army. If Inuit could launch XCOM armies in, they could severely
    weaken if not secure a coastline city for future assaults. I just think betting
    on bloodbath aside from the reconquest of Laredo might be playing it up a bit
    too much, but we never know. I was thinking Thi Li Bi Nai was never going to be
    reconquered by Vietnam and look who rode in. Keep your eyes pealed on this front
    for any odd units moving through Buccaneers or around them.

  narration: Great Famine indeed. Holy hell. It might takes aeons for Civs to reach
    or approve their pre-hiatus numbers, but one thing is for certain is that some
    are more hard hit than others, but almost all are at or over 50% of the way recovered
    and some like Vietnam and Brazil have more population then before. Thankfully
    at this stage in the game, citizens don‘t amount for much beyond science and Great
    People.

  narration: O-Oh my... Henry Parkes will have the money to fund any expansion at
    this rate. Maybe this is why there is so many Diggers around... Either way, it
    seems that many Civs are getting money from other Civs. The only one untouched
    by Australia‘s money sucking hand in North America is Blackfoot. Good job Blackfoot!

  narration: Arianism spreads in North America while Armenia does all the heavy lifting
    with Catholicism. Meanwhile the healthy Lutheranism remains the strongest in the
    world due to being in the Worker laden Africa at over a thousand devote followers.
    Boer‘s once more proving why they deserve the number one spot in the Power Rankings.

  narration: And here is it mapped out for your viewing glory. Now while I could go
    on about wars, I‘ll leave that microphone to you. Echo in the comments what you‘re
    hyped about. Are you more hyped about Inuit and Brazil than I am? Do you think
    Australia will struggle to hold land against Vietnamese? Do you think ANYONE will
    stop the incoming Boer carpet of doom? Now while you rant and rave about who will
    win the three wars in this part, I‘ll make my adieu. If you want any more AI games
    or related content, please check the CBR Battle Royale, the hopefully coming Rap
    Battle Royale, and Civ AI games for more amazing content. This has been the all
    knowing / u/LunarNeedle doing the text narrations and also the charismatic Dawkinzz
    if you‘re listening to the audio narration. Together we both bid you farewell.
