  narration: Hello and welcome to the 88th part of the Civilization Battle Royale!
    I am /u/Scissor_fingers, power ranker, modder, and very occasionally an artist.
    We start off with the amazing /u/Doccit‘s medals. Always such an great source
    of OC for the sub. I wonder what medals will this part will inspire!

  narration: Normal maps don‘t really show us ocean borders which are critical for
    troop movement so when /u/Nathanmasse helped us all out with this super useful
    map, we get to see a lot more context. Here you see that the most ocean encompassing
    country is Australia, as expected, but it looks like the Boers aren‘t far behind.
    The Boers would do well to develop a navy that would rival the Wobbegong.

  narration: Last part, the Inuit managed to steal the number 1 spot from the resident
    ranker favorite, the Boers. We rankers are clingy bunch and didn‘t want to let
    go of our orange death robots for long. The Trungs are facing the wrath of Kruger,
    and the last time orange met green, an entire continent was secured.

  narration: We start the part off with a shot of the front lines. The Boers are still
    starting their advance into Vietnam. They have rallied around Jerusalem, maybe
    hoping to receive blessings from the Spartan gods of war and victory. Armenia,
    perhaps hoping to prove to the rankers that Vietnam is a friend, signs a Research
    Agreement with them. On greener side of the shot, Vietnam is hurriedly rushing
    units to the both front lines, having successfully taken Carrollton from Sibir.
    Is this the start of a breakthrough or is this city destined to flip back and
    forth?

  narration: Ah, mighty Texas. They are probably one of the safest city states in
    the cylinder, only at war with Brazil who can’t reach them. Although, it seems
    like Brazil lacks the navy to take on the outdated Texans anyways. It seems like
    they have decided to host the famous peacekeepers, the Hawaiian Globetrotters.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene06.jpg
  narration: ALERT! The Kimberley are planning to attack another civ with naval assets!
    Probably Sri Lanka! This news would be far more exciting if this wasn’t the 300th
    time the Kimberley was “attacking Sri Lanka”. I predict that all that will come
    out of this is that a fleet will go up to Sri Lanka and yell obscenities until
    they get tired and sail back home. In other news, the Blackfoot carpet has started
    to leak into Vietnam.
- scene_number: "7"

  narration: We see Wulungarra, quickly approaching Kaneohe as the most densely populated
    island on the cylinder, as it prepares for the war effort. They’re building Jet
    Fighters, a wise choice, considering the amount of carriers in their navy. Now
    if only Vietnam started to build an air force, maybe learn something from the
    rumps.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene08.jpg
  narration: Here is the Swedish-Siberian border, freshly drawn after Kekkonen was
    evicted from the premises, maybe he missed a rent payment? One thing that is painfully
    obvious is that Sibir has basically no land army here. People complain that Sibir
    is too low on the rankings but this slide is a perfect reason why they don‘t deserve
    to be higher. They are barren anywhere except the Vietnamese front. A DoW from
    Sweden would tear through Sibir almost as fast as they tore through Finland. Come
    on Sweden make a move and secure superpower status!
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene09.jpg
  narration: Down it goes! Antioch, temporary seat of the Finnish government, gets
    taken by a Swedish Organic Infantry. The Finnish cybersub fleet, trapped in the
    Black Sea can only watch in resigned acceptance as the Finnish empire crashes
    around them. Kekkonen flees to Tigranocerta, relying on the protection of Vietnamese
    peacekeepers as he abandons his people in Tashkent and Yervantashat, leaving them
    to the mercy of the Swedish menace, a lone mech artillery to defend the cities.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene10.jpg
  narration: Vietnam sends a paltry cybersub fleet against the Boer menace, hoping
    to face the famed Boer caravel+GDR combo. A big weakness Vietnam has is shown
    here plainly, there are no planes. Even the Kimberley, on one carrier, has more
    planes than Vietnam has in all the cities in this shot. I know flying is scary
    but I promise you it will help you win!
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene11.jpg
  narration: Now we zoom in on the War of the Mountains, as a Sri Lankan tank camps
    out in Hrazdan, hoping to catch a glimpse of the action. The war is turning in
    Vietnam’s favor but they need to peace out ASAP if they want to hold on to Arabia.
    A lone Australian Digger visits the city founded by Kimberlean refugees in Sibir,
    Jarlmadangah Burru. Is he paying respects to the once great nation that his ancestors
    fought?
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene12.jpg
  narration: You have got to wonder, what is Sibir building in all these cities? They’re
    obviously not making units otherwise, there’d be an actual military presence.
    Do the people of SIbir actually know that they’re at war with Eastasia Vietnam.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene13.jpg
  narration: As Lacsirax Ariscal hypothesized, Hawaii’s mind control of Australia
    is shown through their peacekeepers. The Aussies have formed a protective wall
    at Bamda preventing Vietnamese attack or Siberian counterattack. Also damn, that
    Mongolian carpet is THICC. Freaking teases, showing off, but never giving us some
    of that sweet carpet action.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene14.jpg
  narration: As noted in the last part, Brazil and Australia have signed Declarations
    of Friendship and are seen vacationing together in Korea. Quite a bunch of  Koreeaboos
    I say. Also Korea is starting to build up a land army, maybe too late but folding
    the steel 1000 TIMES takes patience.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene15.jpg
  narration: Oh this is just pathetic, all of Korean China and the Korean peninsula
    is completely occupied by Australian units. Someone should tell Sejong that to
    win a domination game, one needs units. Also, bad news for Vietnam, it seems that
    Australia does not share open borders with them, is this a sign of a foreboding
    Aussie DoW?
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene16.jpg
  narration: Here we see Australia throwing their Garbage Patch at other nations.
    The dump they’ve chosen? Brazil. Seriously Brazil, the only country that you are
    at war with, Texas, could destroy your entire navy in this shot without taking
    a serious loss.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene17.jpg
  narration: Tibet, eternal turtle, for some reason has not founded their religion
    yet, choosing instead to yell at fellow rump, Texas. Maybe Houston did not pay
    his Order of the Rump dues this week. But here also we see Vietnam’s reserves,
    quite numerous and enough to stave off Boer attack and plow straight into Sibir.
    Now only if they could actually get them to the front lines...
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene18.jpg
  narration: The men of the garrison of Tashkent were brave men. Their government
    abandoned them. Their eternal leader ran away from the Swedes. Their military
    ran away from the Swedes. The civilians ran away from the Swedes. But not these
    men; these men saw the Swedes and they stood their ground.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene19.jpg
  narration: We finally revisit the front lines and Jericho seems to have fallen to
    a Boer BioTrooper. Is it just me or is the Vietnamese carpet looking just a bit
    more sparse?
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene20.jpg
  narration: Najran falls to the Boers. Vietnam seems to be suffering major losses,
    but they finally seemed to have gotten the hint and placed 10 planes in Baghdad.
    Will this make recapture easier?
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene21.jpg
  narration: Someone should tell the Oranj Fleets that they’re at war. They seem more
    comfortable enjoying the tropical islands of Middelburg and Ondini. I know some
    captains take R&R seriously but damn.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene22.jpg
  narration: Sibir flips Carrolton, but Vietnam seems poised to take it back. This
    war is more trouble than it’s worth for the Trungs. What happened to their legendary
    peace negotiating skills?
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene23.jpg
  narration: Not much has changed here. The stalemate continues.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene24.jpg
  narration: The true brain of Australia is shown here. The Hawaiian border looks
    kinda like a chicken wing, which is something I just wrote because I have no idea
    what else is there to say about these guys.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene25.jpg
  narration: Little is known about the elusive MiniPedro, the regent of the Brazilian
    empire, but our spies have informed us that his refusal to build a navy stems
    from the fact that he thinks the ocean is a giant toilet for fish and refuses
    to go in the icky water.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene26.jpg
  narration: Matthew Perry, Buccaneer admiral extraordinaire has been tasked with
    improving economic relations with the Boer. Lazily, he sends a message across
    the Skynet to Kruger himself. It reads “Open the country, Stop having it be closed”.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene27.jpg
  narration: The Boers have lost nearly half a billion people due to starvation but
    you’d never be able to tell because they keep pumping out units like nobodies’
    business. The Trungs have many reasons to fear Kruger and this is just one of
    them.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene28.jpg
  narration: Ingolfur pls invade Sweden while they’re rebuilding. (Actually don‘t
    because your navy is mainly carriers)
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene29.jpg
  narration: Sweden makes its final push towards Yervantashat, but a pesky Armenian
    AA gun is in the way, forcing Sweden to make a coastal landing. Armenia really
    squashed the last hope they had at uniting their cities by not dogpiling on Finland.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene30.jpg
  narration: More progress as the Boerange Boerders now include Vung Tau. The Vietnamese
    appear to have constructed a defensive line around Baghdad and Pasargadae, I think
    this is as far as the Boer will go.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Boer navy is nowhere to be seen as Vietnamese subs and arsenal ships
    ride up and down the coast unchallenged. Vietnam also seems to be bringing troops
    to the action while it seems like Kruger has failed to provide his troops with
    reinforcements.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene32.jpg
  narration: One of the theories on Boer depopulation is based on the fact that the
    average Boer is not a human anymore but actually a digital consciousness that
    has been uploaded to SkyNet. That would explain the fact that they don‘t need
    bodies anymore and a reduction in population.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene33.jpg
  narration: At this point one must question Vietnam more than Sibir. How the hell
    have you not destroyed a civ this empty and devoid of units. Maybe the repeated
    nuking from the Finno-Siberian war many parts ago left them unable to think of
    nothing but building buildings over troops.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene34.jpg
  narration: Here we see that Vietnam is slowly un-puppeting these cities in their
    western regions. The Trungs’ experiment with decentralization is now over and
    now they are ready to take charge of the massive resources at their disposal.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene35.jpg
  narration: 'Genghis, as he looked on the vast hills and plains of the Steppe, sees
    peace. As he bends down and plucks a flower from the grass, he hears children
    running from yurt to yurt, playing hide and seek. Their laughs fill him with sadness.
    These are his Mongolians, his children. He knows that one day their laughs will
    be replaced with cries: cries of anger, cries of fear, cries of sadness, and then
    silence. He dreads the day he knows will have to come, but all he can do is prepare
    and pray that tomorrow isn‘t that day.'
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene36.jpg
  narration: The Boer offensive seems to have evaporated. Jericho is wide open; come
    on Vietnam this is your chance!
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene37.jpg
  narration: At this point in the war, it seems a given conclusion that the Boers
    will keep Arabia. The real question is whether they will advance any farther.
    The Trungs have noticed this and have pulled their planes out of Baghdad, relocating
    them to somewhere safer (or maybe they were shot down, but hey let’s remain optimistic)
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene38.jpg
  narration: The Boers have amassed their robotic armies at the Horn of Africa, in
    order to have them cross the Red Sea into Arabia. The Vietnamese cybersub fleet,
    not being able to recapture their cities, have resigned themselves to harassing
    Boer ships in the vicinity.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Trungs flip Carrollton and hopefully this time it will stay green.
    At Yervantashat, one of the last Finnish exclaves, Sweden starts a siege with
    Organic Infantry. Coming to finally realize how screwed he is, Kekkonen peaces
    out with the biggest threat to his empire, Tibet
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene40.jpg
  narration: Vietnam finally reclaims Bamda, and this time it seems to be for good.
    This war is just like the great Vietnamese-Australia war, a pointless meatgrinder
    for both empires to throw units at.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene41.jpg
  narration: We get a shot of Scandinavia, finally unified in royal Swedish yellow.
    An Icelandic XCOM watches as Sweden starts bringing these new provinces to their
    former glory. If there’s anything for Ingolfur to fear, it is Gustavus’s newfound
    power.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene42.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot are actually making very nice progress. They are teching
    up, shown by their new BioTroopers, and they are developing an overflowing carpet.
    None of it matters though. Winter is coming.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene43.jpg
  narration: Last part, Lacsirax Ariscal explained why she thought Iceland is the
    nicest place to live. I say it’s actually Inuit Canada/Texas. They’ve grown quite
    well, the scars of war healed over centuries, and they are in one of the safest
    spots on the cylinder. Iceland lives in perpetual fear of a coalition war from
    the Inuit, Sweden, and the Boers, but the Inuit don‘t have ANY threats that can
    cause them existential harm. The high standards of living, safety, and the nicer
    climate of these regions place it as the cylinder’s prime real estate.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene44.jpg
  narration: I am seriously thinking that during the reboot, Pedro rolled a negative
    naval bias. Has he contracted the Garbage Patch to do coastal security for him.
    Thankfully these two nations have absolutely no history of animosity between them.
    /s
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene45.jpg
  narration: A Korean caravel, while swimming across the deep, encounters an Australian
    flotilla armed to the teeth with missiles. Maybe the crew of this caravel could
    do the same by bolting a Hwach’a on their deck. Iceland also joins in the caravel
    trend and sends two caravels on a scenic tour of the South American coast.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene46.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka seems to have built itself a nice carpet but unfortunately
    it is completely surrounded by Vietnam. I just realized, is Sri Lanka just a bigger
    version of Tibet? If Tibet is the brains of ‘Nam, what does that make Sri Lanka?
    The heart? The liver? The colon?
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene47.jpg
  narration: Kruger is making a push on Baghdad, bombing it down to the red. Is this
    the last of Vietnamese Arabia? Only if the Trungs care to build melee units to
    take it back I suppose.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene48.jpg
  narration: You know that one shot of the Boer navy a little while ago? Where did
    they go? Are they gonna confront the cybersub fleet or not? These Vietnamese ships
    can‘t do anything because Vietnam did not bother to create melee naval ships.
    In other news, a Sri Lankan convoy is escorting a Hawaiian Great Merchant across
    the coast of Africa, hoping to take advantage of the sudden break out of free
    trade.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene49.jpg
  narration: Boer reinforcements are trickling in, and Gyumri is in the red. Is it
    only me who finds that this mess of borders takes place right in middle east?
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene50.jpg
  narration: Sweden takes Yervantashat, officially kicking Finland out of all of Europe.
    Maybe it is time to refer to Finland as what was suggested in the sub. Say bye
    to Finland everyone and say hi to Exclavia!
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene51.jpg
  narration: Kuchum Khan takes back Carrollton and makes moves towards Nishapur, currently
    quite vulnerable. They say that insanity is doing something over and over again,
    and if thats true, Kuchum and the Trungs are the biggest nutcases on the cylinder.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene52.jpg
  narration: The Trungs gather their forces at Khost, Nyingchi, and Nagchukha. The
    young men and women in their armies reduced nothing but numbers and units on the
    vast chessboard of war. Millennia ago, when Stalin was asked about the razing
    of Leningrad he responded “One death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic”.
    This war has generated quite a lot of statistics.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene53.jpg
  narration: I have figured out why Sibir doesn’t like to make land units. The Chinese
    Knights near Hameenlinna must have driven fear into the hearts of Siberians so
    much that the normal Siberian would rather join the navy or throw themselves at
    Vietnam rather than share a carpet with Comrade Mao.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene54.jpg
  narration: The half dozen useful ships in Pedro’s navy make their way to Europe.
    Does this signal a future DoW against the Boers? Or maybe they want to defect
    to a nation with an actual navy, like Iceland.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene55.jpg
  narration: Looking at city populations here, it seems like Brazil has not suffered
    as much from the Great Famine as much as other countries were. This means that
    Pedro has a strong core that he can rely on as he makes war on his neighbors,
    whoever they might be.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene56.jpg
  narration: And now we conclude our part with a shot of major cities worldwide. We
    begin with Seoul. Sejong decided that the best way to redevelop his military was
    to not build any military units at all, deciding to work on satellites instead.
    People should remind him that this game doesn’t have a scientific victory.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene57.jpg
  narration: We worried that nukes were not going to be used in Mk 2.1 but Genghis
    is letting his newly hired general, straight from the invasion of Mali, Gandhi
    make the decisions here.
- scene_number: "58"

  narration: Parakramabahu is trying hard to catch up with his neighbors in tech,
    but the great scientist that he will soon unlock will only delay the inevitable.
    Maybe he should pick out his new outfit for when he becomes added to the Trung
    Sister’s collection of leaders.
- scene_number: "59"

  narration: Stockholm focuses its citizens on food as it desperately tries to fight
    off the Great Famine, stealing tiles from Helsinki in the process. Conquering
    them was enough, but now Gustavus feels the need to prolong the Finns’ suffering.
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part88-scene60.jpg
  narration: Finally the Info Addict is upon us. The Boers (unsurprisingly) lead the
    world in science output, followed by Australia, due to their hundreds of cities.
    Vietnam should really try to fix their stagnant science output if it really hopes
    to come out of this war victorious.
