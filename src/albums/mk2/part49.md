  narration: |-
    Greetings, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to the r/civ Battle Royale, part 49! Here to serve as your narrator today is yours truly, u/sledge115, loyal Korean supporter, usual sub commentator and first time slide narrator.
    Where we last left off, the Buccaneers‘ warmongering have finally caught up with them, resulting in a wave of DOWs from numerous civs from all across the globe, The Mughals and the Maori are eliminated and South America is deadlocked  in a gritty meat-grinder-of-a-war between the resident powers, Brazil and Chile. Who shall come out on top this time around? Let us begin! Our titlecard today is by /u/LordBaconus!

  narration: Our most recent map of the world, as made by our resident cartographers,
    u/LacsiraxAriscal and u/Malistrassa. Pay close attention to the current hotspots
    of the planet; a city today might be gone tomorrow as Yakutia painfully found
    out in their conflict.

    Finally, we have the Boers, rightfully reclaiming their top spot! While they have been laughed and mocked at for their dormancy, pay no mistake - their armed forces alone constitute the most powerful entity in the BR.

  narration: |-
    Our journey kicks off with a shot of the most recent of the Chilean-Brazilian Wars. Buenos Aires has flipped again to Brazil, and a group of Chilean units have been pushed back against La Plata, threatened with catastrophic losses.
    However, a sizable Chilean fleet is just off the coast - and with scarcely a friendly ship in the water, it‘s unlikely for the Brazilians to hold on to Buenos Aires for long, not without ample support.

  narration: |-
    In spite of the numerous declarations of war, there has yet to be a task force from any of the numerous participants large enough to challenge the Buccaneer core, as shown by an Australian Digger, hopelessly surrounded by Buccaneer land forces near Laredo.
    The first wave of Canadian troops have arrived at the Texan border, ready to engage the last garrison of the Texan Army.
    But along the way they pass a peculiar group - that‘s right, the Inuit now have Powered Armor Infantry. These powerful front-line soldiers are sure to consolidate the White Walkers‘ clutch on North America.

  narration: It‘s cannons and riflemen against GWI and artillery as Haile Selassie
    (Ethiopia) continues his rampage across North Africa, slicing a huge chunk off
    Hannibal (Carthage)‘s dwindling empire with the capture of Kongo Dia Nlaza. With
    even more reinforcements arriving from the rear, Carthage looks increasingly unlikely
    to defend their depleted core. Where‘s the rest of them?

  narration: "A lone Buccaneer caravel celebrates their victory in the frigid north
    - where we last left off in this tiny corner of the world, a Malian caravel was
    unfortunate enough to be caught between the Corsair and the Caravel. Ouch.\nEnough
    of that! There‘s rum to be drunk and plunder to be split! Who needs those fancy
    steel hulled ‘destroyers‘ when you have good ol‘ fashioned wooden ships? \nSeriously
    though - that captain needs a promotion back home. I‘m not sure he‘s even seen
    home in some time."

  narration: "Bernard O‘Higgins (Chile) enters the Atomic Era! With research on atomic
    power available, it could prove to be the gamechanger in their ongoing conflict
    against the Brazillians.\nBuenos Aires flips back to Chilean hands - it‘s the
    real prize of this war and both Bernard (Chile) and Pedro (Brazil) are absolutely
    keen on holding on the devastated city. The overwhelming artillery and air support
    Chile has around the fortified city of Castro might prove to be a difficult hurdle
    for Brazil to pass La Plata.\nJust off the coast of La Plata, we see a dashing
    Brazillian helicopter pilot, eager to engage wooden ships with superior firepower.
    He promptly realizes his terrible mistake as Chilean sailors mock him from the
    nearby battleship. \nHe will be missed."

  narration: A shot of the fertile Brazillian core. Meanwhile, from Hanoi, Semiramis
    reports back with news of a Trung (Vietnam) plot against Pedro‘s interests. Whether
    or not it will amount to anything remains to be seen.
- scene_number: "10"

  narration: Not to be outdone by Semiramis, Ishtar reports in from Stockholm, informing
    us of Gustavus (Sweden) plotting against Harun Al Rashid‘s Arabia. Surely, he
    must have noticed the increased Finnish activity in the region and plans to seize
    those delicious Arabian oil fields before Kekkonen‘s paratroopers can get there.

  narration: |-
    Iceland enters the Information Era, bringing forth a colourful new age of technology, wonders, and weapons of mass destruction in Europe. Or, at least, their side of Europe.
    For now, Ingolfur and his hardened sailors remain quiet - but pay no mistake, that fleet is large enough to challenge every single European power bordering the Atlantic and the North Sea.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part49-scene12.jpg
  narration: And with air support, too! No less than three atomic bombs and seven
    aircraft squadrons stationed in London. Anyone declaring against Ingolfur is just
    asking for it. Seriously - he‘s got enough air support to conquer almost all of
    Western Europe in one fell swoop.
- scene_number: "13"

  narration: "The first contingent of the Stop-Offshore-Piracy-Alliance arrives under
    Australian banners, sailing towards Tulum, a valuable stepping stone for anyone
    attempting to invade the Buccaneer homeland. And to the south, a flotilla of privateers,
    led by a destroyer, engage a lone Buccaneer submarine in the first opening shots
    of Australian-Buccaneer war. \nHenry Parkes must be ecstatic."
- scene_number: "14"

  narration: Boer Paratroopers, exiled from Sweden, watch from their encampments as
    Siberian-Yakut forces continue to clash fruitlessly in the frigid Arctic wastes.
    Unless another front is opened, I don‘t see the Siberians or Yakuts progress past
    this meatgrinder. And with a lack of air support, there‘s nothing left to do for
    both sides other than send in a gunship or two across the mountains. Such is life.

  narration: |-
    Meanwhile, further to the East, the Inuit bring in their newest advance in naval technology to the frontlines - a missile cruiser. Unfortunately for the Night‘s King- I mean, Ekeuhnick, he‘ll have to do better than that to overwhelm the sizable Yakutian Navy.
    Across the Kamchatka Peninsula, however, it would appear that the Trung Sisters are following in the footsteps of Kruger and Kekkonen, with Vietnamese forces spilling all over the area. Even as a Korean supporter on my end, I have to admit their recovery has been remarkable.

  narration: |-
    Ah, such a shame.
    Canadian troops withdraw from the Texan border as Lester B. Pearson makes peace with Sam Houston. Texas lives to fight another day yet again. You have to admit their diplomatic tenacity even in their vestigial state - but of course, there are still others waiting for the day Austin waves their colors.
    Such as those eager Mexicans right across the border.

  narration: Iceland shows off their new Mechanized Infantry, showcasing their tech
    superiority once again. With 90 strength, they vastly outclass the still-abundant,
    50 GWIs fielded by the other European powers, Finnish Angry Birds be damned.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part49-scene18.jpg
  narration: Across the Atlantic, Icelandic workers show-off their new communications
    array in front of their jealous Canadian counterparts, a superior version of those
    old fashioned trading post huts. With +3 gold per array, they will prove useful
    in supporting any war effort Ingolfur undertakes.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part49-scene19.jpg
  narration: The meatgrinding South American War continues with no end in sight. Bernard
    secures Tiwanaku to the north, and Pedro‘s army looks lacking in melee units,
    save from some scattered paratroopers and a lone GWI at the front. Unless he commits
    more troops, he won‘t be able to hold a coherent front, and we‘ll risk a shittier
    border gore than the last time these two went at it.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part49-scene20.jpg
  narration: |-
    Well, it would seem that the Inuit are hell bent on lighting the biggest fire the North has ever seen. Another bomb has been dropped on Yakut lands, to the disbelieving eyes of Vietnamese and Boer personnel. Far from being horrified however, they decide to take notes on the use of atomic firepower. Surely, some upstart neighbor could use some cleansing.
    Speaking of atomic power, let us move on to...

  narration: |-
    Sydney! The Emerald Down Under, bastion of the Trans-Pacific Australian Empire! They‘ve grown back to 15 population, and were it not for the everlasting fallout on the mountains, one could be excused for believing this bustling city has never bore witness to the all-destructive power of the atom.
    Sooner or later, Henry Parkes would have that power. And the Pacific will tremble once again.

  narration: |-
    The victorious Finnish Army set up camp around their newly acquired city of Gyantse. Once Tibetan, then Mughal, now Finnish. It‘s worth noting that another newly acquired City by the Finnish (Agra) is home to the Statue of Liberty - a wonder that provides +1 production for every specialist. In the hands of a peaceful, scientific and progressive Freedom civ, it‘s a valuable asset.
    In the hands of an oppressive, militaristic power like Finland, however, it‘s a gamechanger.
    Akbar stares silently at the fallen bastion of Freedom, laughed at by Finnish machine gunners stationed in the city, before retreating into what‘s left of the Mughal legacy - a trio of submarines, a worker, and a Great Musician.
    Well, at least he has music to accompany him.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part49-scene23.jpg
  narration: |-
    And here we see exactly why having the Statue of Liberty in the hands of Finland would be bad news. Finland‘s carpet is massive, and backed by the production boost of the Statue, every unit lost is hardly a crippling one.
    Now, if only he‘d turn his eye towards another vestigial empire - Stalin‘s USSR.
    But of course, this is Kekkonen we‘re talking about. He‘ll probably declare war on France first, and it‘ll be raining men in the Seine.

  narration: |-
    A lone Arabian scout sets up camp in the Mongol enclave of Ulaanbataar, as we see who‘s who in the North Asian balance of power.
    We have Kuchum Khan‘s Sibir Khanate, backed by what could be the largest armored force in the world. Unfortunately, he can‘t move it past those upstart Mongol troops stationed in the border. Genghis (Mongolia) has a weird sense of humor.
    Next we move on to the Boers! These orange and blue - oh, right, they‘re not exactly from around here. Move along!
    Tryghyn 'Trigger' Darkhan‘s Yakutia! A longrunning top contender, most of their army appears to be off screen. Oh for goodness sake- put some meat into it, Trigger. Those Boers are laughing at you behind your back, honest.

  narration: What is this travesty? The King in the North Ingolfur Arnarson has declared
    war on Azor Amao, the fool! Doesn‘t he know his true enemies lie to his east and
    west - the Lion Gustavus and the Inuit White Walkers?

  narration: |-
    So it begins - the Battle of the Atlantic commences! Malian-Boer ships engage the first Buccaneer ships on the front. It‘s wood vs metal, iron and steel. The seas shall be stained with blood and oil, and the skies will burn.
    Ahem - in spite of numbers, the Boer-Mali fleet present are outmatched against the pair of Buccaneer destroyers, and that‘s not even counting the naval task force they‘re keeping in reserve further north. Of course, the bulk of the Boer fleet is lying on the other side of the continent, and the war has only begun.
    Of note is the sizable Morrocan Navy patrolling the seas off Sale - should they join the war on either side, it would make or break them.

  narration: |-
    Tiridates (Armenia) enters the Modern Era! He would need to upgrade his army and improve his core, however. The only civ that matches them in technology by military alone seems to be the neighbouring Persians. And that‘s bad.
    GWIs form the backbone of all the surrounding powers, and  Tiridates would be wise to modernize his riflemen army.
    He‘s still at war with Sweden, after all. Sooner or later a stray Swedish Infantry will come along, after thousands of years navigating their way through the densely populated region.

  narration: |-
    Now that‘s a sight for sore eyes - the nations of the world agree to construct the International Space Station, even with all the wars still raging on this is quite the uplifting news!
    Of course, this uplifting announcement is shown along with the utterly ridiculous shot of the truly massive Boer Army present in Yakutia. Seriously - they outnumber the Yakut ground forces on their own lands.
    Here‘s to Kruger declaring war on Ekeuhnick, with the cover of ‘peacekeeping‘ duties.

  narration: |-
    On the other hand, the other half of the UN members vote on banning Citrus, a valuable commodity for sailors. Things don‘t look good for Henry Morgan‘s men, with the threat of scurvy on the horizon.
    The Wobbegong Armada task force sent to invade the Buccaneer holdings in South America grow larger and larger still - and soon, they‘ll be all over the coast. With scarcely any naval units close by, the Australians are sure to flip a city or two with their invasion force.
    Unless Morgan mobilizes his Atlantic fleet to intercept the task force, the coast of South America may be painted green, as the Kimberley and Maori before them...

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part49-scene30.jpg
  narration: |-
    The Trungs continue their plotting, faithfully monitored by Semiramis. Their next target? Tiridates. Clearly, the advancement of another nation to a new age of discovery is too much for the Sisters.
    Like the Boers and Finns before them, the Vietnamese have covered their lands in a sea of red and green, an army large enough to rival the Sibir and Mongols to the North. Before long, we may see another war engulf East Asia.

  narration: |-
    In spite of the Wobbegong presence, Morgan still has a trick or two up his sleeve - make that four, hah!
    Four atomic bombs, poised to strike at the Australian fleet. With the memory of the Maori strike still fresh upon the older officers‘ minds, the fleet hesitates in their advance.
    But the board is set, and the game is on. Tulum shall be theirs to take.

    Carthage burns. Ethiopia rises.
    Kwilu falls to the red, and a GWI is at the gates of Carthago Nova. I fear this is it for Hannibal - the days of the Elephants are long past, and with not a single melee unit around, every capture made by Selassie is theirs to keep.
    Unless the Boers, or Mali intervenes, there‘s nothing left for Carthage to do, but wait for the blade to strike.
    Help them, Cossack. You‘re their only hope.

    them to swoop in out of nowhere, but here they stand, a solitary watch for the
    men of the New World.\nThe Vietnamese continue to pour everywhere, and soon enough
    all the Blackfoot men are staring in jealousy over their fancy new rifles and
    parachutes. \nOn that note, how on Earth are they occupying Olongapo‘s tile? Did
    the Blackfoot declare it an open city?"

    The Emperor of the French has awoken! Soon, his armies shall march with triumph into the lands of...

    Well, it‘s something. With luck, they might be able to squeeze in a few armies through the gaps across the continents. Oh well.

    As advised by his councilors and mamikonians, Tiridates has decided that Autocracy shall be the new way of life for the Armenian people, in the hopes of protecting himself further from the wrath of Sibir or Arabia.
    That‘s all they can do for now, really, along with Persia.

  narration: |-
    Chile makes peace with Brazil once again, with a scarcely changed border. Once again, Pedro has failed to claim what should have been his all those years ago.
    Really, the war served nothing but weaken both Bernard and Pedro‘s armies - the Andean Mountains are simply too treacherous to pass, and the Brazillian core is far too deep to be invaded.
    For now, South America slumbers yet again...

    ....or not.
    The Wobbegong Armada‘s might is unleashed upon Morgan‘s vanguard of Tulum! Should it fall, it would give Parkes a valuable foothold for his fleet to resupply and strike, again and again at the black heart of the Buccaneers!
    Where will he go next - the vast yet unprotected Gran Colombiarrr, or the Nassau Canal?
    However, Morgan‘s not going down without a fight - and the power of the atom is within his grasp. Five atomic bombs in Tulum. One is enough to cripple the Wobbegong. Two will destroy them once and for all.
    But will it be enough to stop the endless fleet of Henry Parkes, streaming in from his Trans-Pacific Empire, from the Sunrise Land to Sunshine Coast?

    Oh sweet-Jesus, Maria the Mad has declared war on Morgan, in spite of her advisors and common sense itself!
    The Buccaneer-held Iberia is nearly empty, but that Buccaneer destroyer‘s not going to sit still and watch the maddened queen take her ancestral lands once again.
    Well, they‘ll go out with a bang. Good to know you, Maria.

    Another one! This time, the Trungs have rightly decided to correct Mirwais (Afghanistan)‘s god-awful borders, and then some! Even as a Korean supporter, I salute their just cause - because honest to god Afghanistan‘s borders are just the worst.
    Balkh and Mawlamtine are set to fall to the Vietnamese with their overwhelming Paratrooper Corps, and then they shall reclaim their Mandate of Heaven. Tis a glorious day for Vietnam, it is.

  narration: |-
    I‘ve summed up their strategy too soon, because Jalalabad is also within striking distance! With only a handful of artillery and a lancer to defend the city, the entire Eastern side of Mirwais‘ Empire is at risk.
    His air force is certainly large enough, but with the sheer number of Vietnamese soldiers pouring in through the Himalayas I don‘t think they can kill them quickly enough.

  narration: |-
    Tulum falls to the red, but not before the Buccaneer air force stationed there is evacuated to nearby Huamanga. A group of Buccaneer ships attempt to halt the Australian advance, but it‘s too little too late.
    If Morgan plays his cards right, he could drop an atomic bomb right at Tulum as it falls to the depleted Wobbegong Fleet, annihilating them in one swoop.
    Vitcos, meanwhile, falls to the yellow under heavy carrier-based aircraft bombardment, with a destroyer looming behind the carrier group.
    No sign of the main Buccaneer fleet, so for the time being, Parkes reigns supreme over the South American coast. And the coveted Nassau canal is within his sights.

    The Ethiopians continue their ruthless advance, taking both Carthago Nova and Kiwilu. Ejura falls to the red, and it‘s only a matter of time before the first Ethiopian soldiers reach the gates of Carthage itself.
    Prime your F keys, ladies and gentlemen. With no single melee unit to be seen, there‘s literally nothing Carthage can do other than stall the Ethiopian advance long enough for a foreign intervention.

    Amidst the carnage and bloodshed in South America and North Africa, the International Space Station is 50% complete! I‘m absolutely sure that either the Boers, Inuit, or Sibir are focusing all their production to gain yet another technological lead over the rest of the pack.
    Because they‘re clearly not strong enough already.
    Speaking of technological leads, I think there‘s an ancient group of Mexican composite bowmen somewhere in this slide...

  narration: The Battle of the Atlantic rages on, and the Buccaneers are absolutely
    trashing the combined Mali-Boer fleet. Mansa Musa has a few ironclads in reserve,
    but judging from the look of things they are, for the time being, stuck in Tomboctou
    until Ahmad Al-Mansur (Morocco) decides to open his glorious, Gateway to Africa
    open borders for Mali.

    watches in bitter silence, lamenting the could-have been and neverweres of the
    Maori Empire.\nThey could have been great. They could have challenged the Australian
    might. They speared the god-forsaken devil itself, a shame it will never forget.\nThey
    fell all the same, for the vengeance of Parkes was terrible and swift. \nWiping
    a single tear away, the admiral retreats to the depths of the submarine, hoping
    to find news of Te Rauparaha‘s whereabouts in the vast, unforgiving ocean.\nDamn

    The Boer Military proudly show off their newest accomplishment - the Drone Fighter!
    Boasting a strength of 100, compared to the Jet Fighter‘s 75, and a range of 12 over the latter‘s 10, these are the ultimate in air superiority, fully securing the Boer dominance of the technological arms race.
    But that‘s not all Kruger has to offer...

    With a ranged combat strength of 90, it will pound a city to oblivion before its realized what‘s hitting it. And what‘s more, it can carry two missiles along for the ride, adding to its tremendous firepower.

    Well I‘ll be damned - Hannibal‘s still got it in him!
    Hannibal gives up most of his rapidly collapsing empire to Haile Selassie, reducing him to a two-city, vestigial empire. They‘re not dead yet, but I don‘t expect them to make any major moves in the future.
    So, for all intents and purposes, I take my hat off for the Once-Punic Empire. They had a brilliant run, bouncing back from a massive tech disadvantage to create, however briefly, an empire spanning from Dvin in the Sinai to Carthage in Tunisia.

    Isit has been recaptured and from the looks of it, there‘s hardly any Inuit unit nearby that can recapture if for them.
    A huge detachment of the Ice Sheet Fleet outnumber the badly mauled Yakut Navy by a margin of 3 to 1 - but with all those pesky new Vietnamese peacekeepers in the way, they won‘t be able to pass the Kamchatka.
    The Yakut land army looks incredibly small for an empire their size, but the Inuit have yet to bring a sizable enough army to the frontlines. Looks like the war‘s slowing down, just like the recent Brazillian-Chilean Wars.

    Speaking of which, it seems to be recovering nicely in pop - unlike the Union‘s brief revival, the Sioux have a chance to actually develop.

    The lovely Agent Em has uncovered a plot by His Majesty Hierarch Sejong in Seoul, behind Tygyn‘s back. That unit carpet was certainly no mistake - he‘s seeking to reunite Pyongyang with the rest of the Empire. Rumor has it a megalomaniac dictator has taken a foothold in the city‘s politics.
    All jokes aside, the Korean Army is large enough to begin spilling into Yakut lands, a testament to their power. If Sejong declares, he should be able to seize some of the cities with citadel based borders, like Tyokhtyur, or the airbase of Hiroshima.
    I wouldn‘t worry too much about the Vietnamese Army just below the screen - the Korean Air Force stationed in Suwon is large enough to hold off whatever units the Trungs fling across the border.

    Yakutia does look like a juicy target; if the Boers are teleported out, I don‘t see a reason why Genghis can‘t take a city or two from Tygyn. Cross your fingers!

    As much of a Korean supporter as I am, I have to admit that Vietnam has proven itself to be the East Asian version of the Boers and the Inuits. If they keep this up, their empire will stretch from Modern day Afghanistan to Central China.
    Anyways, from the looks of it, Peshawar should be their next focus. Should the Vietnamese hold it, it will open the floodgates as they break out of the Himalayan barrier and into the Afghan core. Pay close attention to the region, I guarantee it will see the fall of another power.
