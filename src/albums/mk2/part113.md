  narration: |-
    Good evening/morning/afternoon/whatever time it is where you live fellow CBR observers! My name is u/Vihreaa, (map guy) and I have the pleasure to be narrating this week’s rendition of the Civilization Battle Royale!
    We start this week with our weekly showing of OC, which this week is the Ghostball of Crowfoot, created by u/Pizzarcatto. He without a doubt went down with a bang, reviving civilizations left and right. He truly deserves the name Necrowfoot.

  narration: "In a total upset, The Blackfoot take #1 in the Power Rankings this week!
    \nWait, you’re telling me they’re dead? Oh….\nBut in reality, Brazil places first
    in the PR this week yet again, to the point where we all know it’s going to happen,
    and every narrator says the same thing, along the lines of “Unsurprisingly, Brazil
    takes the number one spot in the PR again this week! Will anyone be able to top
    them?”\nBut we all know nobody can."

  narration: "We are blessed this week with the beautiful map detailing the current
    state of the world, created by the ever so talented u/Vihreaa. \nAll jokes aside,
    a map like this shows that anyone can become relevant. Here I am, narrating a
    part and having my map in the album! To all you lurkers out there, you too can
    become relevant, just like me!"

  narration: Our next map for this week is the usual installment of the Tile-Accurate
    map, created by u/DerErlenkonig, which is a staple of maps for the BR. Showing
    off Brazil’s ever expansive expansion, Sibir’s progression into a rectangle, and
    much, much more, in the highly enjoyed tile-accurate format.

  narration: |-
    We start off today with Brazil’s capture of Portobello from Iceland. If you look to the right of the screen, you’ll notice that Iceland, the Boers, and The Inuit have all made peace with Brazil. Sorry guys, we’re in Total War™. But with those peace deals, all invading troops are pushed out of enemy territory, as you can see with Iceland’s Big Carrier fleet in the north.
    In this slide alone, over 50% of Iceland’s navy shown are carriers.

  narration: Moving to the Swedish front, Sweden has done a fine job on defending
    against CARNIVAL, with no city captures this turn. I will applaud Sweden for how
    well they’ve held up against Brazilian party-goers, although Brazil may not even
    be pushing very hard on this front for all we know.

  narration: |-
    Things have come to a temporary standstill on Sibir’s Western front as well. Brazil is making a push East of Kharkov, but they aren’t really pushing into any one city, more so just the gap between three….
    If Sibir can produce some more units and planes, I could see them retaking their lost cities from Brazil here.

  narration: Chimgi-Tura has fallen, along with the hopes of Siberian supporters,
    as Brazil pushes through with ease what used to be a Vietnamese-Siberian meat
    grinder. Mini-Pedro is really not someone you want to mess with. Sibir holds onto
    Samarqand, the former Timurid capital. Does anyone even remember when The Timurids
    were in the game? Pretty sure they’re before my time.

  narration: "Siberian troops march into Chamdo, facing only a Mech Artillery to resist
    them. Brazilian party-goers mosey their way over to Lhasa, but didn’t capture
    any cities on this slide. Could we see the possibility of a revival of Tibet?
    \nGhost Necrowfoot, advising Mini-Pedro from his throne: “My lord, we must revive
    the Tibetans! Think of the humiliation it would bring to the Trungs!” Mini-Pedro:
    “Hmmmmm…..”"

  narration: |-
    This seems to be a slow turn, huh Pedro? Maybe Mini-Pedro needed a quick break, and put Pedro II in charge for this turn. Vietnam’s cities on this front look fairly secure. They should be able to pick off embarked units with ease here.
    But even though Brazil didn’t push this turn, Hanoi can still be seen in the distance. The gap between the front lines and the capital shrinks every day.
    Imagine what is it like in Hanoi.

  narration: Boer penguins begin to honk in their flippers as CARNIVAL approaches.
    It’s only a matter of time until the once mighty Boerg fall. Maybe if Kruger is
    lucky he’ll get a spot in Pedro’s zoo in Rio de Janeiro in the Penguin exhibit.

  narration: "Vietnam retakes Jakarta, bringing along some beautiful border gore with
    it. \nIn other news, Vietnam relentlessly continues to bomb My Son, but with no
    melee units nearby, the city looks safely Australian. Hang in there, little buddy."

  narration: |-
    Henry Parkes flies by in his private jet, observing his beautiful and healthy cities.
    “Everything is fine.” He continues on his flight to Canberra.
    Meanwhile, Brazil captures more cities in Japan and China, purely for the reason to grow Pedro’s anime collection.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene14.jpg
  narration: |-
    Australia retakes Kyoto from Korea, and Brazil’s capturing of cities from Vietnam could be compared to a vomit green sword shanking a majestic green dragon.
    Seoul is also bombed into the yellow, but there doesn’t appear to be any troops nearby that could take the city.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene15.jpg
  narration: No captures on the Sibir-Vietnam front this turn, but if you look at
    Sibir you can tell that they’ve started to annex some cities, specifically Dalandzadgad
    and Beshbalik. Vietnam’s core also looks shockingly empty. They are possibly one
    of the civilizations who have lost the most due to this total war. I’d also like
    to point out Sibir’s transformation in borders from Imperial Germany to a literal
    rectangle. Best glow up of 2018

  narration: "The Inuit take the valuable city known as Druzhina, likely securing
    their victory in the battle roy-\nNot quite. \nOn the other hand, this slide is
    the closest we can get to where Mongolia’s final city was. Yes, you heard it right,
    Mongolia has been eliminated, in a huge upset that nobody saw coming.\nMongolia,
    as one of the few Firaxis civs in the game, proved themselves to be quite resilient
    against other civs around the cylinder. He managed to hold onto his capital until
    just before the very end, where Kuchum Khan proved himself to be the superior
    Khan in the end. Finishing 11th, that is likely Genghis’s deepest regret, of not
    being able to finish in the top 10.\nPlease Press F to pay Respects."

  narration: Korea hasn’t manage to capture any of the Inuit’s cities here, but they
    do show off a sizeable navy and airforce, with 62 Korean air units on this slide,
    compared to the White Walkers, who only have 33 air units, and whose provisional
    capital of Sanirajak is in the yellow.

  narration: |-
    All of Australia’s Japanese holdings are in the black in terms of city health, but it looks like those cities will still hold for a while, with their formidable carpet of troops.
    You’re gonna have to be quicker than that Pedro if you want the anime~
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene19.jpg
  narration: The Brazilian-Australian stare-off continues, as Australia sends a carrier,
    and  Brazil a Cybersub. Hate to break it to you Henry, but you just don’t bring
    a carrier to a submarine fight.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene20.jpg
  narration: |-
    Through just seeing Brazil’s navy in the distance, almost 12 million citizens of Coff’s Harbor have died. Leaving the city at a still ridiculous size of 78.5 million people.
    Who even is this Coff? Why is he important enough to have a Harbor to be named after him?
    It looks like the city was named after John Korff, who took shelter there from a storm. I wish I could just name stuff like that.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene21.jpg
  narration: Brazil captures Hervey Bay from Australia, and the citizens of Bundaberg
    (that sounds funny haha) cower in fear as they cannot do anything to stop the
    endless spread of CARNIVAL.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene22.jpg
  narration: What’s this? Could it be? Brazil has lost a city? Australian troops valiantly
    retake Quandan, giving a big middle finger to Pedro in the process.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene23.jpg
  narration: "The sounds of CARNIVAL could be heard in the distance. “Captain! Brazilian
    troops are sailing straight for Port Royal! At this rate, they’ll be here in hours,
    we can’t stop them!” \nHenry, in his drunken stupor, attempts to respond. “W-what?
    I thought Brazil was still stuck burp fighting the Inuit?” Henry stands up, and
    promptly collapses, too much rum. Henry’s advisors take Henry and escape to their
    provisional capital of La Habana, but their fate is sealed."

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene24.jpg
  narration: Iceland has miraculously managed to hold onto Newfoundland for another
    turn, against all odds. It’s the small victories that count, guys.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene25.jpg
  narration: The Inuit have done a fine job of holding Brazil at this point, and it
    probably helps that every one of their cities in this slide is filled to the brim
    with what is probably planes. (Couldn’t you have done this when the front line
    was in Mexico guys?)
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene26.jpg
  narration: Brazil might be getting a little cold, with their progression of fighting
    the Inuit. The cold winds drown out the sounds of CARNIVAL.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene27.jpg
  narration: Brazil holds strong onto their captures cities though. With the split
    straight through the middle of Inuit territory, The Inuit stay strong in their
    divide between East and West.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene28.jpg
  narration: The Western Inuit core in Alaska  seems pretty devoid of land units,
    but on the navy side of things they don’t have a problem. It’d be really great
    if they actually had melee boats so they could do something with their fleet.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene29.jpg
  narration: "Iceland’s last stronghold of York has fallen to the CARNIVAL. Iceland
    is now purely an island nation, with no cities on mainland continents.\nBut wait!
    That one guy says. Iceland still has one tile of land in Europe, in the bottom
    right corner! See! \nHush.\nIn this slide, we can really see Nebuchadnezzar’s
    power. Almost all nations of the cylinder have made attempts to make peace with
    each other this turn, but are barred from it, because of the ordained “Total War”
    coming from the sub. We are just forcing these nations to send millions to their
    death purely for our entertainment."
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene30.jpg
  narration: And boy oh boy is it entertaining! Brazilian troops continue to march
    into Swedish Denmark, surrounding the city, but Visby stands strong. Pedro has
    also made the controversial decision to embark a sizeable force of troops into
    the sea, heading either for England or Scandinavia.
- scene_number: "31"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene31.jpg
  narration: |-
    Brazil’s push of troops from last turn seems to have just skipped all of the cities we thought they were going to attack. Where are you guys going? Only Mini-Pedro knows.
    In the upper left corner Jönköping falls into the red, with Brazil just on their doorstep.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene32.jpg
  narration: Sibir holds Samarqand for another turn, but we all know deep in our hearts
    CARNIVAL cannot be stopped. Brazilian troops begin to surround Urgench, which
    is likely to fall next turn, due to its low health.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene33.jpg
  narration: Brazilian party-goers vastly outnumber the Vietnamese on this slide,
    but haven’t captured any cities. The mountainous region east of Brazilian Raj
    may prove difficult to take from Vietnam.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene34.jpg
  narration: "'Between you and me, your army is kind of the laughing stock of the
    world.' \nThis is honestly what the world thinks of Vietnam at the moment. They
    still have a sizeable amount of land and production at their disposal, yet they
    have a country almost devoid of units. \nIt is my prediction that Vietnam will
    be the next great power to fall."
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene35.jpg
  narration: "Korea just really isn’t in a good place right now. With Sibir approaching
    from the north, and Vietnam to the west, their days really are numbered. \nAt
    least they didn’t instantly collapse like some other nations we know, cough Ekeuhnick
    cough Kruger cough Gustavus."
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene36.jpg
  narration: |-
    We get a good glimpse at Korea’s core here, save their capital of Seoul and some northern cities. While they do have a sizeable airforce, they really are lacking in land units, to defend themselves and capture cities with.
    Also, how does Hamhung have 12 air units in it? I always thought that the maximum was 10, and I’ve played through games with the future worlds mod. How odd.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene37.jpg
  narration: |-
    This slide does very well to illustrate why I have so little faith in Vietnam. Don’t get me wrong, I love Vietnam as a country and what they stand for, but they have so little units in this slide, and this slide shows so much of their core as well.
    On another note, the city of Ca Mau has been settled, just in time to be captured by CARNIVAL.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene38.jpg
  narration: Australia has one of the largest militaries in the cylinder, but you
    wouldn’t be able to tell on this slide. If Vietnam could create some melee ships,
    (which thinking realistically they really won’t) they could easily take the cities
    they border on the coast, all of which are in the red.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene39.jpg
  narration: |-
    We get a look at Australia’s Antarctic colonies, and it’s looking like Quandan is going to be retaken by Brazilian XCOM’s next turn. We can also see the southwestern tip of Brazil’s mainland empire, specifically showing off their navy, which if you look hard enough, you will see a single melee ship.
    I don’t like you Pedro, but I have to admit you’ve got me on this one.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene40.jpg
  narration: The citizens of Bundaberg begin to feel the pain as Brazil arrives. With
    a grand total of 4 melee ships, Brazil at this point is completely unstoppable,
    and will without a doubt capture Bundaberg. Hope those Australians like to dance.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene41.jpg
  narration: As we move to the Inuit front, the Inuit have done well again in holding
    off Brazil’s CARNIVAL. With a good carpet, it’s looking like they’ll last for
    a little bit, but Brazil’s waves of the party never stop. Why exactly are the
    Inuit holding off Brazil now? Why not, at the start of their war?
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene42.jpg
  narration: Brazil have captured the city of Saint John, further pushing the Inuit
    out of southern Canada. They haven’t made any gains on any other Inuit fronts,
    though. Could they be building up troops for another push?
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene43.jpg
  narration: |-
    Kleflavík has been captured by the mighty Pedro, with Húsavík looking soon to follow. Iceland held the entirety of Newfoundland under Brazilian siege for about 2 turns, and if that isn’t a win, then I don’t know what is at this point.
    When you really think about it, I believe almost every single slide we’ve seen this part so far has included Brazil. For an upcoming part, we should have a pro-Brazil narrator, and just narrate from the point of view of a Brazilian, providing pro-Brazil propaganda.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene44.jpg
  narration: In the Caribbean, we can really see how badly the Buccs fared this turn.
    With only two cities left, and both of them in the red, we might all have to prepare
    our F keys for next turn folks.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene45.jpg
  narration: WOAH! In a huge upset that I actually didn’t see coming, Brazil has taken
    4 cities in the western Pacific, from both Australia and Vietnam. Who knows how
    many more cities Brazil could take like this, acting as the clean-up crew to other
    nations duking it out.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene46.jpg
  narration: "Brazil also captures Kyoto and Wakayama from Australia, and the city
    of Gwangju has been nuked off the map, by either Korea, Australia, or Vietnam.
    Who knows. \nBrazil is starting to make quite some headway into Asia here. The
    end could be sooner than we all expected."
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene47.jpg
  narration: Korean cities gain a bit more health, and hold off from enemy forces
    this turn. The Koreans still remember Pyongyang in all of its greatness, and fight
    on another day to remember its name.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene48.jpg
  narration: |-
    Brazil still holds Ambarchik, as their forces either prepare for an outward attack, or just wait for the people surrounding them to be surrounded themselves by Brazilian reinforcements.
    For some odd reason Gongju is the only city in this slide which has full health.
- scene_number: "49"

  narration: |-
    A Siberian Robot Infantry captures Phu Xuan, and laughs in robot at the Brazilian XCOM who couldn’t, and the Brazilian XCOM can’t do a single thing to stop it, because it isn’t his turn.
    Brazilian troops also continue to flow into west Vietnam, and while they haven’t captured cities yet, they sure are bound to soon.
- scene_number: "50"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene50.jpg
  narration: Sibir boasts a sizable carpet of units, compared to their neighbor of
    Vietnam. With Vietnam having a total of 3 units to defend Xigaze and Hoa Lu, Sibir
    stands to make some good gains into Vietnamese territory.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene51.jpg
  narration: |-
    With both Guangzhou and Otrar at or almost at 0 health, it looks like Sibir will capture them soon, causing Vietnam to lose even more cities.
    I count a total of 13 Vietnamese land units on this slide. That’s only 3 more than Korea, and they only have a snippet of their land in the shot!
- scene_number: "52"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene52.jpg
  narration: |-
    Samarqand and Urgench have fallen to CARNIVAL, but Sibir has enough troops near Samarqand to make me believe they might be able to take it back.
    That’s just another capital to add to to the ever growing list of Brazil’s capitals.
    In my personal opinion the Capital Scoreboard chart should be renamed to “How close Brazil is to winning”
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene53.jpg
  narration: |-
    Sibir has a startling low amount of troops on this front. This is the front that you want to be defending, Kuchum. On the contrary, Brazil has a very powerful looking force marching east.
    With Kouvola having 0 health, it is definitely poised to fall next turn.
- scene_number: "54"

  narration: Sweden manages to not lose any cities on this front here, but you can
    tell that Helsinki was flipped, due to the resistance in the city. Sweden doesn’t
    have too many troops, but they are making the ones they do have count.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene55.jpg
  narration: |-
    Sweden holds all their cities on this front, as well. They have managed to pick off most of the Brazilian troops invading Visby, keeping the city safe.
    For now.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part113-scene56.jpg
  narration: This slide shows a whole lot of water, and a fair amount of boats in
    that water. The Brazilian border to the west is what I assume is from Newfoundland,
    and all of the Icelandic cities in this slide have been bombed into half health
    or less.

  narration: "And just like that, the Buccaneers have been eliminated from the game.
    \nThe Buccaneers were arguably one of the most interesting civs to watch in the
    entire game. They managed to form a trans-Atlantic empire, controlling territory
    in both Africa and South America, they truly ruled the seas in their prime. But
    alas, for the Boers and Brazilians pushed them out of their land, and isolated
    them to small chunks of Central and South America and the Caribbean. \nThe Buccaneers,
    in my opinion, had probably the coolest looking borders in their prime. Just the
    combination of Africa, the Caribbean, and South America made for a really nice
    looking country.\nI believe losing Arrrfrica to the Boers was inevitable, but
    defeating Brazil was a real possibility. Just imagine what the cylinder would
    be like with a defeated Brazil. Oh, how the world would be different today.\nAnd
    to think too, This turn the Buccaneers and Brazil somehow made peace. If not for
    total war, The Buccs would have still been alive today.\nFinishing in 10th place,
    the Buccs are one of the 10 civs that made it to the top 10. In an upset. many
    thought the Boers would be eliminated first, due to their absolute lack of strength
    to defend themselves, but no, it was the Buccaneers. Henry, you absolute madman,
    never change.\nF"

  narration: As expected, Húsavík falls to the mighty CARNIVAL, and with that Iceland
    has been eliminated from mainland North America. Pedro focuses his troops on Hafnarfjordur,
    which will inevitably fall soon.

  narration: The Inuit somehow hold for another turn, but Brazilian troops are on
    the offensive. With the Inuit’s large airforce, they may yet be able to hold out
    for a short while longer.

    some carriers down south, appearing to try to retake Kangiqtiniq. \nShould we
    tell him?"

  narration: THE GREAT BUNDABERG HAS FALLEN! Known for Bundaberg Rum, it seems only
    fitting that it fell on the same turn as the Buccaneers. As we speak, Brazil is
    slowly making gains in the Pacific, slowly approaching the Australian mainland.

  narration: "We end this week’s segment of the Civ Battle Royale with the fall of
    Quandan once again to Brazil, looking to be quite securely in Brazilian hands.
    \nBeing honest, I feel like this slide is mainly here for the mappers of the subreddit,
    so they actually know that this city flipped, because I personally know that I
    never would have noticed.\nIt has been an honor to narrate this part of the CBR,
    and I hope to contribute even more the community in the future. This is u/Vihreaa,
    signing off until the next time I narrate, which will presumably be in the CBRX.\nPS:
    For all you people wondering about the Boers, they are still in fact alive. With
    my screenshot of the game being more detailed, I can say with 95% accuracy that
    the Boers are still alive and honking."
