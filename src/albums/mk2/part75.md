  narration: |-
    To the far north, beyond the great Arctic circle. Two ships lie in anchor off the coast of Qikiqtaq and celebrate their great discovery. This project, one of peace between the Walkers of Ice and the masters of Ocean has seen both recover an object long believed to be nothing more than a legend spoken of and believed only by fools and the feebleminded.
    Yet those doubts are cast aside is before them an object anyone would throw away any cost to posses.
    What is this object? Why it is the lost GBS Terror, former sword of the Babylonians, now lost Babylonian exploration ship. A ship of legends, said to be filled with knowledge of lost worlds that can help those take over this.

    was shown in the last few parts (hint, lots of people died).

  narration: This part is a return for more than a few parts, as Paul Kruger once
    more leads his nation into the number one spot. Why he chose to cosplay as Midna
    from the Zelda series upon hearing the news, I shall never know…

    Funny to see that only 4 of these nations have no beefs with anyone that require
    a war to deal with.

  narration: |-
    As we can see in this slide, The Kimberley are sending a fleet of reinforcements into Australian waters (who are filled with weapons more matching a lost era, like one this unit comes from…). This fleet, unlike other forces committed to this war with Japan by The Kimberley stand a better chance of actually taking out Japan this time. After they take the city after they have blasted it with a nuke it seems.
    In the South China Seas, two great Empires stare at each other from across the waves. Australia, as always, controls the Philippines. While in Vietnam, the sisters regard those lands with envious eyes. It is a state of affairs that has almost become natural for both powers, one that if it ever was to see a great war breakout between either side, would surely leave a great mark upon the world if that was to happen. A point that seems to hold some truth based on the build-up by Vietnam right on the boarder with those Australian holdings.
    Thankfully, we have the likes of Shi Huangdi to stand there and try to keep both sides apart from anything unwelcome ever coming to pas…
    *TP whispers into my ear.
    “Yes, I am reporting the events of Civ V Battle Royale. As you can see, both nations are where they should be.”
    *TP Whispers again.
    “What do you mean by ‘Mark II’?”
    *TP Whispers once more.
    “Wait…what? WHAT?!”
    *TP Whispers in more detail.
    “You got whom there? They did what? With the thing? In the where? OH GOD! Bet they felt that for days! Right, let this unit do a system update then.”
    *Unit updating protocols, update history.
    “Ok, I think I have it…maybe.”

  narration: |-
    While war might be tearing the world apart, that doesn’t mean that the politicians are not going to try and find something to do, which is why the UN has announced that they are going to Embargo Mongolia, something I’m sure is really going to disrupt the global trade markets, if there was such a thing in this world.
    Related to points of war, it seems that Mongolia is not doing so well against Yakutia. Well, that is, if Korea wasn’t there to lay the hurt into Yakutia for them leaving Yakutia to attack with pretty much everything they have left as they try to hold back the Korean wave.

  narration: |-
    The middle east, regardless of which Battle Royale, always remains a location where great (and not so great) Empires clash over who, and what really matters in the world.
    Right now it seems that making Judaism the world religion isn’t one of them, much to the disappointment to stateless children of Israel. What does matter is the defence of Jericho and Sparta, as both cities have come under attack from the Cylon War Machine that is the Boers.

  narration: |-
    In the land known as the graveyard of Empires, it seems that Sibir might’ve finally cracked the curse and lead Afghanistan to their final doom as Afghanistan uses their last engineer and trade missions try to find a way out of the place they are in. You put up a good fight, but every Empire must find a way to die.
    Prime the F everyone.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene09.jpg
  narration: |-
    Speaking of putting up a fight, La Cucaracha here is showing the world how a few nukes their way is generally not the type of thing that has a habit of slowing them down. There is a lot you can say about Mexico, but their will to bravely charge in is not the least of them.
    We know how Mexico has done so far against two major powers breathing down on them (Australia and Buccs). I do wonder how they might fair if the Inuit was to ever turn on them.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene10.jpg
  narration: A more detailed view of the great Mexican standoff. As it has been for
    the last few parts, Mexico has done well to throw enough forces to build up a
    line of defence that protects their core from attacks by either Australia or the
    Buccs, even if they are using tech that is generations removed from what either
    power is throwing at them. Sure, this does give a bad sign to some about how poorly
    both Empires can throw themselves at someone like Mexico (Australia at projecting,
    Buccs at fighting on their own backdoor), but it does show how good land can do
    wonders at helping someone hold out for as long as they can when the decks are
    so clearly stacked against them.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene11.jpg
  narration: |-
    Another strategic view, this time focused around Bay of Bengal. Sure, there are important details to see here, such as the drain of Vietnam forces around Sri Lankan homelands. Or the signs of what types of developments/wonders have been built in these lands, but they are not the important part.
    The important part is the general lack of signs that show this area is an active battlezone.
    Both Vietnam and the Boers are locked in battle with each other, yet neither side is making any moves in the one area they have direct access to the other from. Stranger (and by this stage, rarer) still, there are no signs of any nukes getting thrown at each other. Sure, you do see the odd sign of damage here and there, but beyond that, nothing. Almost as if they have some plan at work…
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene12.jpg
  narration: |-
    Buccs- Are not giving up this land without one hell of a fight, even if that means making deals with the devil to ensure he can stand tall.
    Iceland- They are either are committed to this war, or are kinda using it to troll both the Buccs and Boers. Not too sure really, since the small(ish) force they have is a mix of the high tech and “I can’t believe they still have that”. That is before you get to the fact that they are leaving cities they have taken undefended, since they all but feel the Boers are not going to try and push for them.
    Boers: Still deeply committed to this war, but I wonder if they are at the tactical limits of what their supply lines can give them. Sure, they have taken most of Africa, but their core cities are so very far away from the front, those new cities are going to take a while before they grow into something useful for them and their remaining forces are having issues locking down their coasts as tightly as they want.
    Long term, this looks like a good thing for the Boers, but if someone like Vietnam or Iceland make an active push against them, they might get stuck fighting a pointless side war that delays their total breakout.
    It also seems that Babylon has a new spy at play now! Welcome Peshgaldaramesh! May the trip from the sub be a safe one for Pesh (or Pes?) as you try to keep many balls in the air!
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene13.jpg
  narration: TP is not one for layabouts on the sub (even if he already has enough
    of them on there already), so he gets Pesh right to work by sending someone to
    Korea. A nation I’m sure many would like to get a better view of, after their
    big gains of late.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene14.jpg
  narration: |-
    France might be long gone, but the survivors of that nation talk Morgan into allowing them to build a colony on the African coastline, one that can be used to launch a great campaign against the Boers for the heart of Africa.
    Too bad the idea might’ve worked better if the Buccs sent them with any form of protection.
    As an aside, this city sits around the location of Katsina was in the first Battle Royale. Such a location marked the southern lines of African France by the final part. A sign that while things do change, sometimes little things do find a way to remain.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene15.jpg
  narration: |-
    Of the two main powers in this part of the world, only Vietnam looks to be making an active move towards building a carpet of some form, even if they are not too interested in  using it to try and push against the those Boer holdings in the Red Sea. If this is because of the hard work of the Hawai‘ian peace keepers is up in the air. What is known is that other than Basra, this is not an active hot zone for either power (even if Jericho has seen some combat).
    Even then, neither side seems too interested in making any major aggressive moves there. Both sides here seem more interested in using the chance to dig in and focus elsewhere.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene16.jpg
  narration: |-
    While Vietnam mightn’t be making any active pushes against the Boers in any major ways, that doesn’t mean they are not going to go easy on them. Hence why a small naval force has currently been deployed towards the Southern Indian Ocean with a load of nuclear weapons at the ready. If you might recall, this was a tactic that Brazil used against the Boers long ago, one that saw one of their core cities burn for the first time in a while. It didn’t do much, but did prove someone can bleed.
    If Vietnam can pull this off, they might cause the strike that hits Kruger in a bad way.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene17.jpg
  narration: |-
    Speaking of Brazil, we get a shot of their core. They have done well for themselves after taking over Chile, and for pulling out of that war with the Boers before it risked turning on them (as unlikely as that seemed).
    A possible question for them is where shall their eyes turn in future. Back to the Boers? Or towards the largely empty lands of the Buccs?
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene18.jpg
  narration: |-
    Once more, we get another strategic view. This time of North Africa.
    The nukes, as always, have been flying by everyone here with pretty much no city left untouched by nuclear fire. Other than Tangiers that is.
    Does seem that Fort De France stands tall with the Buccs and Iceland using their naval assets to hold this location at all costs.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene19.jpg
  narration: Pesh is actively working to give everyone the latest updates directly
    from the frontlines, and it does seem like Yakutia has found a line to dig into,
    how well that works against the Koreans is anyone’s guess.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene20.jpg
  narration: |-
    Not to be outdone with wars, the Inuit and the Yakutia are still locked into a fight to the death here. On the face of it, it seems that Yakutia are doing a lot better than the Inuit are, since they are pushing hard against them and have made all their cities in this part of the world suffer in this war.
    In reality, the Yakutia are currently unable to find the means to take any of these cities, which has left the Inuit with a way to build their forces back up for a counter attack against the Yakutia.
    Sometimes all it takes to make the difference is to use the first gains you get as much as possible. Otherwise you just give your enemy a better reason to show you the meaning for your mistakes.
    Other than that, the Koreans seem to be more focused on sending their forces to the main frontline over any secondary one.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene21.jpg
  narration: |-
    A view we haven’t seen for a little while, that of Bucc controlled central America.
    For fans of Morgan, the sight of the black flags is one that should warm their hearts as they look upon the Buccs core. They might appear “empty” on their boarders with Brazil, but it is wrong to think the Buccs don’t have the forces close on hand to throw against anyone who might make a move in that part of the world. Boer or no Boer.
    In the first Battle Royal, most of this area was controlled by Mexico, who had a hard time trying to remove the Bucc holdings around where Guatemala is in the real world (aka, where Port-au-Prince happens to be located). In this reality, the Buccs have a hard time trying to remove Mexico from their holdings. Worlds might be different, but also the same in many ways.
    As to Texas, they might’ve given up on Austin for now. Doesn’t mean they want to ensure Mexico knows who settled that city in the first place!
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene22.jpg
  narration: Out of nowhere, Korea sends a wave of forces to take the largely undefended
    Verkhnevilyuysk. Yakutia was so focused on fighting Korea elsewhere, and on the
    Inuit in this part of the world that they failed to plan for the unexpected.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene23.jpg
  narration: The push against Yakutia is once more on. Right now they might be able
    to hold the line, but it is looking far less likely that they will be able to
    find a way to rally themselves against those pushing against them.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene24.jpg
  narration: |-
    It seems that two of the frozen powers have figured there is far more to gain elsewhere than to keep fighting this war. Not that it likely means much, as neither power was really making any major moves against the Boers for the most part (beyond capital sniping by Iceland).  So far it seems that Iceland has done the best from this war, since they have gained a few key cities for themselves, but I don’t like their long term chances of holding them as gaining them was one thing, it is another when you have rivals like Finland, Sweden and the Buccs right there waiting to pounce on the first sign of weakness.
    This does put the Buccs in a worse position, as they are going to have to dig in a lot more if they want to knock the Boers out here.
    (Before anyone wonders “WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY THAT IN THE OTHER SLIDE!”, I like to hold info like that for the slides where the info actually matters, such as here.)

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene25.jpg
  narration: |-
    Another view we haven’t seen for a while, that of the South American Pacific coastline.
    As we can see, the major Empires here have been working hard to build up that all important carpet for their part of the world (other than Australia for their Chilean holdings). As we know, it is always important to show off your carpets in the best light when Korean and Icelanders come to visit!

  narration: |-
    The Koreans rush and taken yet another city from Yakutia, and it is looking even less likely that they will find a way to slow the Koreans down at this rate.
    The only thing that might help them in the meantime is those Brazilian and Finland peacekeepers who look to want to create a Yakutia wildlife preserve where they are allowed to run free.

  narration: |-
    Info time!
    Of the many nations still left in the game, it seems that the best cities in the world all belong to the Boers. Something that is likely a source of pride for Kruger and his people. That, or something that leads to endless posts online about which city is better between either Pretoria or Klerksdorp.
    You also get a chance to see who currently owns which wonder out there.

  narration: |-
    Vietnam is now making an active push against the Boers in the middle east, and in a big way!
    They have begun the “de-Boerification” of the Middle East by taking Najran off from them, then settling the city of Vung Tau to ensure no one tries to mess with them here. Seeing how distracted the Boers are with the Buccs, this might prove to be the major help the Buccs need if they wish to hold there.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene30.jpg
  narration: |-
    Australia has built up her forces around Mexico to make yet another big push into Torreón and Monterrey. If this plays out like all the other times, Australia will be able to take out those units before Mexico has a chance to recover, but shall stall somewhere after making a landing until Mexico suddenly grows some units out of the ground who push back once more. If this doesn’t break soon enough, this might end up making Australia look like the underdog here!
    As to underdogs, it seems that Mexico is interested in reuniting Texas once more, if only under their control.

- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene32.jpg
  narration: The second Korean push is showing no signs of slowing down as they charge
    right at the gates of Zhigansk. With everything still focused on that push against
    the Inuit, Yakutia really has nothing left to try and rebuild a defensive line
    here.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene33.jpg
  narration: |-
    With Iceland pulling out of the war, the Boers can now take the chance to try and rebuild those lands they took from the Buccs, if only so they can put some supply lines in place for the future.
    This is not leaving the Buccs in a good position, as this war is starting to drain them of any value they might find in holding onto these lands in the long run, more so with Brazil looking to want to throw their carpet around somewhere.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part75-scene34.jpg
  narration: |-
    Yet another strategic view, but of the Madagascar Channel this time.
    Much like the shot of Vietnam, these lands look largely untouched by the hands of war. Which means that Kruger will have no problem with keeping the supply of goods he will need to supply his Cylon War Machine.
    However, it is the somewhat lack of units that had been shown in other parts that means something is clearly up here.

  narration: |-
    The Kimberley war fleet finally makes it to the Japan, but they stand still off the coastline, making the Japanese commanders wonder just what might be the next thing in store for them.
    The crazy rumour doing the rounds currently is that the world has fallen for the “so called” latest anime hit out of Japan, a show called “This Island Japan (aka: Battleship Japan/Island)”, which is the story about how a major earthquake hits Japan, shaking the landmass off from the bedrock and turning it into a floating island that sails the oceans of the world. The main characters of the show are a group of school girls who restore old war machines into working order so they can then go and do battle with their enemies in them.
    How believable that rumour is depends on how big a fan you might be for girls who fight in restored old battle tanks.

  narration: |-
    A rare sight in the Battle Royale, a state of peace between two nations.
    Now sure, some of you might believe that it is in the best interests of the Sibir to march in on Mongola and take these lands for themselves. Or for Mongola to try and make a run on Sibir before they recover enough to build their carpet back up, what with the Koreans cock blocking them with the Yakutia. Those are good ideas, but honestly they both serve the others interests by working to keep major rivals at bay for both sides. Mongola helps the Sibir by keeping the Koreans away from them for a while, while Mongola knows that Sibir is there to help block a direct route to them from Finland.
    It works in both their interests to stay at peace is what I’m saying.
    If they do that, well time shall tell.

    The Blackfoot/Australian islands of Hawai’I are generally pretty peaceful for the most part. The surf is always pounding, the sun is always warm, the smoke monster attacks are down this time of year. Everything about the place makes people feel at ease about the world at large. Even when the Australian fleet goes and carries out some war games, it isn’t enough of an issue for the Blackfoot to worry about, as them and the Australians are “mates” at this point. Brothers in arms waiting for a good war to go in on together.
    A shame some fool who wanted to be a Prime Minister called the war games a “a conga line of suckholes” upon seeing the fleet in action.

  narration: The Boer Cylon forces release yet another wave of nukes at the Bucc Colonial
    Forces. Bucc Colonel Tigh is reported to have gone and yelled at his crew that
    they need to impress the old man or die trying. He later started to demand that
    someone “turn off that Fraking music” coming from the ship before leading the
    battle of the line outside Fort-de-France.

    Sibir has suddenly discovered a spanner thrown into their invasion of Lashkar Gar when a force of Ethiopian survivors show up outside the city. Seems those trade missions might have given them a small moral boost just when they needed it most!
    Too bad Sibir isn’t at war with Ethiopia, nor has much of an issue with them.

    Ah Korea, you might not be the same Korea from the first Battle Royale, but the impression Kim Jung Un left on your people shall be felt for many generations to come.

    Well, it seems we have a slight issue here. The narrator has malfunctioned yet again, and this time in the middle of a part. However, fear not! The mighty TPangolin has found yet another replacement, this time in the form of /u/TechnostarBTD5!
    As we return to our slightly irregularly-scheduled programming, we get to appreciate what true border gore is, while at the same time, marvel at the numerous dead civilizations on the slide. We can see units from China, Ethiopia, Armenia, and Tibet.. Wait, the last two aren’t dead. Yet.
    Speaking of dead, Finland is recovering smoothly from being practically nuked off the map. No fallout or pillaged tiles exist on this slide, and most cities are in double-digit population again. A Siberian general roams this land, wishing it was his and marveling at the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the two. Pretty much the only thing that concerns me as a Finland supporter is their choice to build power armor instead of XCOM.

  narration: A wave of XCOM hits Buccaneer Italy, quickly surrounding the city of
    Cumae. Its health is still at full, suggesting that Finland has yet to do any
    significant bombing raids. It is likely to stay that way as well, since most of
    Finland’s air force was destroyed in the Kekkoning and Kekkonen has yet to rebuild
    it. A Dvinnish infantry watches from the southeast, possibly thinking about recapturing
    one of his former cities.

    Perhaps the more important part of the coalition is the war all snakes have waited for: Brazil vs. Buccaneers! I cannot overstate just how important this war is to the balance of power in the region. As any Brazilian would know, Brazil’s carpet is nearly full. Meanwhile, Henry Morgan is still incredibly cautious when it comes to the scary thing known as a land army.
    At sea, the situation is different. While Brazil finally learned how to build a boat, it is nothing compared to the famed Buccaneer navy. I expect many of those coastal cities to flip, but not before both sides try to ram their carriers into each other.

  narration: 'Ethiopia, tired of the warring that destroyed their nation, has decided
    to try to save another nation: Afghanistan. Ethiopian units occupy 4 out of the
    6 units next to Lashkar Gar. Unfortunately, one of the other two spots around
    the city is occupied by a Siberian infantry. Get your F keys ready, everybody,
    this graveyard of empires is almost in a grave itself.'

  narration: |-
    Suddenly, invaders from another place arrived. The technological difference was vast. Jet fighters and heavy artillery were used against the inferior force. Unfortunately, the one with the jet fighters is not Japan. Unlike in the anime “GATE”, Japan is the one using horses against jet fighters. However, clever Japanese animators have taken the opportunity to model a similar anime after the events taking place. Korea rejoices at this latest anime and begs Japan to run a second season.
    However, what is strange is the complete lack of combat taking place. Jandamarra has not fought a war in so long that he seems to have forgotten what the “ranged attack” button is. Osaka remains undamaged, despite the numerous nearby Kimberley units. Wake up, Jandamarra, you’re at war!

  narration: "I feel something wrong, like there is a gaping hole in my side. It feels
    like it’s been there a while, as if I have looked at it twice without noticing
    what was wrong. I wonder what it is. Then, I hear a frog croak. I remember it
    now. Ribbet. Rabat. What was once a city is now a pile of rubble in the irradiated
    wasteland of Western Africa. \nDramatic wording aside, we also see that the Boers
    have taken back Carthago Nova and Gades, taking advantage of the Buccaneers’ new
    distraction to launch another offensive. Careful analysis of the slides has revealed
    that the Boers also now control Kumasi. After years of trial and a whole lot of
    error, the Boer Skynet has concluded that hovertanks, in fact, cannot capture
    cities."

  narration: After a tour around the world, we wind up back in South America, where
    Brazilian units have swarmed across the border and into Buccaneer territory. What
    surprises me is that the only target of Brazilian bombers has been Tiwanaku, which
    just so happens to be the only border city they haven’t surrounded. Around Machu,
    we see what amounts to basically all of the Buccaneer resistance.

    live in Indian ghettos? Having your host plot to brutally murder you in your sleep.
    What’s sad is that Sri Lanka will actually have a fairly difficult fight if they
    try to kill the Ethiopians stationed in their lands.

    if: Mexico had many units, Mexico was not at war with two strong neighbors, and
    most importantly, if Mexico actually bordered Yakutia. Meanwhile, Australia sends
    an embarked AA-gun towards Monterrey, perhaps planning to actually capture the
    city for once.'

    As our espionage reports continue to trickle in, we are made aware that Korea is plotting to destroy the last legion once and for all.
    In relevant news, Korean bombers have reduced Elgyay to black, with a melee unit in range. Yarmanka and Nizhnekolymsk are also at 0HP, but with no nearby melee units, they will probably stay Yakutian for a few more turns.

    slides in this simple list of all major statistics, arranged by population. The
    Inuit and Australia have both begun the Future Worlds population climb, sporting
    over 400 million inhabitants each. Finland has recovered significantly and is
    now at 30 million, nearly half of what they had before the war.

  narration: Korea has taken Elgyay, leaving Yakutia with only 9 arctic cities left
    in their empire. Genghis Khan looks at that turn of events with disappointment
    in his face, as his SAM was *this* close to capturing the city instead. The Inuit
    seem to have brought another melee unit to the frontlines, a robot infantry near
    Zhgansk.

    Back to Brazil! By this point, it is clear that the Brazilian army has undisputed superiority. More units continue to surround border cities. I have a feeling Brazil’s turn has not processed yet, since units are in the same spot as we last saw them.
    What we can see now is the Buccaneer naval counterattack near Valparaiso. This key city took Brazil many turns to conquer during the Annexation of Chile. However, without a melee ship nearby, Morgan looks to be unable to take the city soon.

  narration: It seems as if Brazil wants this to be an intercontinental conflict.
    Unfortunately for Brazil, the only form of intercontinental warfare they know
    is sticking their land units on small boats and charging blindly forward. However,
    it might be enough to take Sale, given its current, bombed-out state. Only time
    will tell if they manage this before the Buccaneer navy tears them to shreds.

    Boer attacks. XCOM squads still surround key European cities. However, expect
    Iberia to remain Buccaneer for some more time, as Kekkonen has yet to send in
    enough XCOM to defeat Morgan’s cities.

    We now see where Finland’s air force went. I count up to 45 planes in this slide. What still confuses me, however, is the complete lack of airstrikes. Maybe they are saving up for an all-in attack with their hypervelocity missiles at the ready.
    In Africa, the Boers have secured Olympia without Icelandic support of the Buccaneers.

  narration: You may be wondering if I would ever mention the ever-important war notification
    at the bottom of the screen. Well, here it is! The Mexican Standoff has heated
    up as the Blackfoot join in again. Of the original participants, the Blackfoot
    were the first to drop out after retaking only one of their cities. This time,
    it appears to be different, as the Blackfoot have already taken the Sioux capital
    down to black, with paratroopers in range to take it immediately. What would make
    everyone’s day is if the Blackfoot resurrect the Sioux AGAIN, passing up the opportunity
    to take another capital.

  narration: We now turn our attention to the Pacific coast, where troops from Australia
    and the Blackfoot compete to take Torreon first. I predict Australia, since their
    turn has not processed yet. An Inuit settler eyes the area, planning to settle
    down as soon as a city becomes too uninhabitable for Mexico.

  narration: "Press F to pay respects. The Graveyard of Empires has finally fallen
    to the Sibir horde, adding another victim to Kuchum Khan’s empire. \nAfghanistan
    was an early contender, settling the fertile Indus river valley and eventually
    expanding their empire to Bangladesh, as well as settling two Antarctic colonies.
    However, they soon stagnated, losing the prime target of the Mughals to Finland.
    By the time Vietnam came around, Afghanistan was an empire in decline. Vietnam
    quickly took most of their empire, leaving the once-proud communist state with
    only 3 cities. \nWhen WW2 broke out, Sibir declared war on Afghanistan. This conflict
    was initially a success, as Afghanistan managed to flip 2 Siberian cities, including
    one in the Middle East. However, when Vietnam, Yakutia, and Finland made peace,
    it was only a matter of time before Kabul finally fell. Rest in peace."

    vs. Mexico. Conflict continued in Yakutia, Mexico, and the Mediterranean, and
    Iceland made peace with two new capitals in their control. \nThis has been your
    emergency narrator, /u/TechnostarBTD5, and  /u/Squato we hope you enjoyed this
