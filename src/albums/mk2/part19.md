  narration: |-
    Hello, good citizens of the submarine, and welcome back to Part 19 of the Civ Battle Royale! I am /u/jlim201, tracker of cities, and well that’s it. My narration isn’t very colourful with great stories, but it gives you all the facts you need, with a few jokes tossed in here and there.
    Having said that, I’m a mediocre civ player, a geography nerd of post 15th century things, and a person who really likes the Civ Battle Royale. So, now, put away whatever you are doing, and watch as I present to you, Part 19 of the Civ Battle Royale!

    Here’s a map from u/SylonL, cities added by u/LacsiraxAriscal. Almost all pieces of land are claimed, the only likely changes from here on out will be city flips.

  narration: Here we see a shot of Sri Lanka. Although their fleet looks impressive,
    it is made completely of triremes, which are very outdated, when there are caravels,
    and even frigates in the world, and some of their neighbours have galleasses.
    Not wanting to be left out, Parakramabahu joins in on the new popular thing, bullying
    Timur. Also, notice the lack of units from the Mughals in the top of the image.

  narration: A look at Kamchatka. The Inuit, relative newcomers to Asia decide to
    insult the natives, the Yakuts. For most civs, this would be a grave insult, but,
    the Yakuts are so deep in their slumber, that this barely alarms them, as everyone
    is too drowsy to fully comprehend what this means. Also, Arabia joins the “Pick
    on Timur” club.

  narration: America tries to repeat history by invading the Sioux, near Yankton,
    this time, they look to be rather unsuccessful. A small force attacking, with
    few reinforcements coming is doubtful to be effective, especially with America’s
    previous warring history. Texas, on the other hand, is doing a much better job
    at representing the colonizers, effectively taking cities (Sisseton) from the
    Sioux. Also note Mongolia joining the “Pick on Timur” club. Also, look at Canada’s
    territory, and look at everyone else’s. See the difference?

  narration: With so many picking on poor Timur, he decides to send all the troops
    to Ghazni and Multan, while he plots in the capital. The only solution he can
    think of is a unit carpet, but he cannot fathom how to make one. Every time he
    tries, all that is created are flying carpets. All he can do, while he figures
    out how to create the proper type of carpet, is to send men to the front lines,
    leaving the core devoid of units.

  narration: Southeast of the Baltic sea, or where the IRL fortress Lyakhavichy lies,
    the fortress mess, making Minsk nearly untouchable, well at least from the southwest.
    Unfortunately, the Russians threat is not Poland, and definitely NOT Byzantium.
    It’s Finland, otherwise known as where the fortress isn’t.  Finland has a very
    large army on the Russian border, ready to strike at any time, while Russia, has
    a less significant army.

  narration: Back to the Caspian sea, and the Timurid front. The Russians have declared
    war on Timur, and unlike most of their DOW’s, the Russians are actually a threat,
    as they have a direct border, as well as Open Borders from the Huns. The USSR
    isn’t the most prepared, with few units on the border, however, the Timurids are
    less prepared. All they have are galleasses, not as helpful for a land attack,
    with several knights, trebuchet and pikemen. Japan also pointlessly declares war
    on Timur

  narration: The Northern Islands, as they are known locally, are full controlled
    by Kimberley and Australia.  To the north, Manila is under attack by the Champan
    navy, who had several cities sniped from them by Australia. Kimberley has a very
    large navy between the islands, and although Australia has less units, they are
    frigates and privateers to Kimberley’s caravels and galleasses.

  narration: The Impi’s attack up the western coast of Africa. The leaf warriors (Pombo),
    defend the city best they can, although the significantly stronger Impi are doing
    significant damage to the city. However, the Kongo has a huge army up, north of
    their capital, while the Zulu don’t have the luxury of reinforcements to the front
    line. The Zulus also have a warrior on their front line. Basically a waste of
    space, taking up valuable unit room. Note a very lacking army from the Boers,
    at least in the west, where their likely largest threat, Kongo.

  narration: The boring south of South America. Chile has a rather large navy, that
    they can probably soon upgrade to their very powerful unique frigate. Argentina,
    on the other hand, has a very small navy, made mostly of triremes. Chile can surely
    beat Argentina, however, the two South American Sleepers seem to be on good terms,
    although I’m not sure either Bernardo or Eva are paying enough attention to see
    each other’s boats in their territory. Also, Portugal captured Rome. Not a big
    deal.

  narration: |-
    And there goes Rome! Portugal’s constant stream of very small groups seems to be effective at taking Rome. Italy is a complete mess of empires, much like the real Roman Empire, who were split up into many small pieces after the fall. Sparta does not seem primed to retake the city, meaning that the city might stay in Portuguese hands for at least a few turns. Sparta has a thinning military, having to deal with the consequences of their conquests.
    You can also see the the France-Germany war to the north, nothing happening, other than thousands of military deaths I guess.

  narration: Western Africa is a place of lowly populated cities and small, ancient
    armies, likely due to the horrible desert terrain. If any outsiders with any proximity
    were to invade, it’s very likely that the area would be quick to fall. Just look
    at the huge Portuguese navy to the north. Granted, they may not know how use it,
    they are an AI after all, but so is Morocco, Carthage and the Mali.

  narration: East Asia, where the main power, Vietnam has a large army near the Chinese
    border. Everyone out here has an army (if you count mountains as units for Tibet),
    a large Turtle Ship navy from Korea, units carpeted across Mongolia, and an ample
    defensive force from China near Tabriz. Korea has both of its very powerful unique
    units right now, and if they were to strike at China, they could slaughter them.
    China is the obvious weakling here, but they are like a Mao (Mao is cat in Chinese)
    with nine lives, they should have been dead a long time ago, but they are still
    alive, even taking undefended cities from overconfident neighbours.

  narration: Inuit are clearly winning up here. With Sendai taking damage, the Japanese
    navy pushed back, several of the Japanese cities are set to fall. The Inuit have
    a larger, more modernized navy than the Japanese, which means they should be able
    to crush Japan. It seems like the Inuit will continue to sail down the coast,
    unless the sleeping power awakes and punishes them for entering Asia.

  narration: Afghanistan has a rather large military for the area, but so do the Mughals.
    Formerly a top pick, the Mughals have fallen to a small turtle, but they could
    send the Afghans to their own graveyard by stabbing them in the backside (the
    southern cities). The Afghan military is trying to attack the Timurids, but they
    seem to have forgotten that mountains are hard to climb. If they can get around
    them, the Timurids center is empty, and they can roll through.

  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene17.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Sparta needs to defend, not attack. Especially not attack with an insufficient
    force. Armenia has a decent defensive force, obviously strong enough to hold back
    the weak Spartan offense. With how thin the Spartan forces are, even Byzantium
    could take a city, and we all know how weak they are, but their units are all
    together (as they have to be, in such a small empire), while Sparta’s are spread
    out, trying to defend several different fronts.  To the side, Korea joins the
    “Pick on Timur” club, while Yakutia decides to leave them alone for the time being.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18

  narration: Sibir, although they look impressive, and are doing an excellent job
    of destroying Timur, have a pretty much non-existent military north of their capital
    of Qashliq. However, the city defense up here is pretty high, especially compared
    to other undefended expansive empires (aka Sparta), with 30’s across the board.
    A huge worker army won’t help you fight though, but the cities will hold time
    for reinforcements, especially with somewhat weak neighbours. The Soviets have
    also built a pretty useless navy in the Kara Sea. There is also a Yakutian army
    within Sibir, it might have been for Timur, but it could be for anyone.

  narration: Navy Lover’s paradise. Champa, Australia, Korea and Vietnam all have
    massive navies. Surrounded by these navies, is a city with no navy, Manila. It’s
    not like their northern neighbours are weak either, although the northern Japanese
    are currently distracted. As well, look at southern Vietnam. No units. Now look
    across the border, at Champa, where there are plenty of units. Champa is definitely
    a threat to all their neighbours, although they haven’t done anything yet, could
    strike anyone at any time. Granted, they shouldn‘t attack Australia, but they
    could probably hold their own there too.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene20.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: A look at Brazil, where nothing is happening. South America is filled
    with infrastructure builders, that could mean many things, maybe a huge strike
    at someone expanding, but not developing, or this could just a part of a game
    long turtle, which eventually gets killed by a more productive empire. The Inca
    have a large military, although outdated, and the Argentines have a more up to
    date military, but is much smaller. Brazil is up to date, and large, making it
    the obvious power here, but they aren’t unstoppable. Also Finland joins the club.

  narration: We head south to Chile. To be honest, Chile looks stronger than Brazil.
    They have a larger navy, and pretty much a unit carpet, as well as an unbreakable
    barrier, mountains. They could wreck Argentina, although they seem to be on good
    terms. Chile is just boring!
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene22.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    Well, looks like I was wrong! Sparta is on the verge of retaking Rome, giving them back the lead for capitals. Sparta has rushed units across the Adriatic to Rome, although adding units to one front often means losing units from another. Wonder where that front is. This is likely the best move though, Maria is the only one actually being threatening to a city.
    France seems to be losing to the Germans, although they do still seem pretty equal. France also has a sizable military on the Portuguese border, which is doing nothing. That war is definitely a stalemate, and it’s doubtful any cities will be gained. Portugal and Poland have to gain from these wars than either of the participants.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene23.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: |-
    Timurids, where Sibir has just taken Multan.  Those crescent knights are so devastating. Somewhere in Samarkand, Timur is still failing to make a carpet that suits his empire’s needs. He’s considering flying off in a flying carpet; however, Timur is definitely very timid of heights. This empire is definitely not a jewel, if you know what I mean, Tus seems to be next to fall, and with few units, and no defensive bonuses, the city will be quick to fall, if Sibir wants it, which they surely do.
    In other news, the Huns have rebuilt their military, and Tibet doesn’t seem like it would fall over anymore without their mountain walker. Also, big war in North America, we’ll see what the situation over that once my uncontrollable image sender gets me a picture of that.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene24.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: There’s that picture of the new North American war. Canada has a huge
    force on the Sioux doorstep; the cities between Lake Manitoba and Superior are
    in trouble. Also, to help Canada’s case, the Sioux are focused on fighting Texas
    in the south. The Americans, as usual have fumbled their doomed attack, which
    are now on a spread out retreat through Texas. The Quebec region in Canada seems
    pretty thin on units, although are there really any major threats up there?  Maybe
    moose and slipping on frozen maple syrup. The Inuit also have a rather undefended
    force in the south, while the Blackfoot have the opposite.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene25.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: East Africa, where Ethiopia has capitalized on a distracted Saladin (Ayyubids),
    who inexplicably had the bulk of their forces in the west. Also, the Ayyubids
    are also at war with the Boers, where a few of their units are committed, and
    that is a pointless endeavor. Ethiopia seems to have modernized their military
    a bit, owning longswordsmen and composite bowmen, still behind, but not as far
    as they were. Once the bulk of the Ethiopian military hits the border, the Ayyubid
    border cities of Baalbek and Zabid are in trouble.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene26.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Portugal, controller of Rome, Lisbon and the giver of cities. Sparta
    did a stupid, and peaced out when they were on the verge of taking Rome back from
    Portugal. Granted, it is a small 3 pop city, but there’s more than that. If a
    mud hut was something you needed to win, you would get it. Same with Rome. Portugal
    has a pikeman carpet on Iberia, as well as defensible lands, Portugal shouldn’t
    fall anytime soon, and they are one of the stronger powers in Europe. Maybe the
    capture of Rome should redeem them from the sale of Braga.

  narration: The Maya are still alive due to one little thing, or very large thing.
    Hawaii is the only thing keeping the Mayans from falling, and this is probably
    a good thing. The Bucs could choose Hawaii as their next target after the Maya,
    alas, there can only be one island nation in the world. The Buccaneer navy is
    getting bombarded from the shore, and they can do nothing about it, unless they
    declare upon Hawaii, which they seem uninterested in doing. Texas also seems to
    be at war with the Bucs, but that is of little interest, as neither seems interesting
    in fighting in the Texan Gulf (Gulf of Mexico IRL)
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part19-scene28.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Focusing on Manila, a starving city. A decade or two ago, they had “8”
    people, now they are down to “6”. If they aren’t taken over, this city will become
    a ghost town sometime soon, and the attackers won’t know what to attack. With
    four massive navies, versus a single galleass, it seems like the Philippines death
    will be sooner rather than later, their fate is not in their hands, they are like
    one waiting for death, slowly starving, waiting for someone to decide to put them
    out of their misery.

  narration: Israel, one of the more disappointing civilizations in the BR, decides
    to capitalize on a distracted Ayyubid. Dvin is rather undefended, a mostly dead
    scout won’t help. The main blockade for Israel here is the one tile gap to Dvin,
    and having no naval dominance. Israel can’t just brute force it like some civ’s
    can. They have a carpet of workers and religious peoples, which isn’t helpful,
    especially in war. Unless they plan to convert the city to them religiously, which
    is impossible, the religious people should get out of the war zone.

  narration: Scandinavia, where both contenders have an equal army, almost carpeted
    on both sides. Finland, seems to be at war with someone, as well as having a much
    smaller military, in Scandinavia at least. Sweden has crammed in another city
    inside, Lund, which was used as a frontier for Christianity. It is possibly starving
    out a few other cities. That isn’t great either. Everyone up here is pretty equal,
    Sweden and Norway building carpets, Finland expanding and keeping up in military.
    No one up here is particularly behind or ahead.

  narration: Kongo has also DOW’d Ayyubids. The Ayyubids are becoming the new Ashanti.
    Kongo is by far their strongest neighbour, and they have already gotten Gondar
    to a quarter health. With enemies on all sides, how long can the Ayyubids survive,
    will they go the way of the Ashanti? Carthage and Arabia both have units on the
    border as well, both capable of taking cities. My prediction? Dead Ayyubid.

  narration: As I predicted, Carthage has indeed attacked the Ayyubids. Kongo Dia
    Nlaza and Kwilu are pretty much surrounded by Carthage, they should fall quickly.
    However, Ayyubids have most on their military in the west, or where Carthage is.
    This seems like a repeat of the Ashanti story, yet it could lead to a great comeback,
    unlike Mr. Tutu.

  narration: Indonesia enters the Renaissance. They look rather outdated compared
    their neighbours, with mostly triremes, while galleasses and caravels are the
    world norm. If the any of their neighbours look at them, I wouldn’t ever bet on
    Indonesia, and when all your neighbours are stronger than yourself, you better
    strengthen yourself, or look forward to a sad ending and the hands of your enemies.
    Quite luckily for Indonesia, you can barely see any Australian frigates from their
    borders.

  narration: And here’s Trireme Lanka. I mean Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has an outdated
    navy and army. However, due to weak neighbours (Mughals and Burma isn’t what you
    call strong, although Burma is technologically ahead, and could get an advantage
    against Sri Lanka), and excellent terrain, with only one land entrance, and even
    that is blocked by the weak Mughals. Until a strong nation kills the Mughals,
    Sri Lanka looks rather strong, but if they don’t strike at at someone (hint hint
    Mughals), they could be relagated to a future turtle. They have now also entered
    the Renaissance.

  narration: Francis Drake, British Sea Captain has been sent to the Caribbean. Will
    he be a friend or foe to Britain? Or will he turn his back on his previous life,
    and destroy the British. Or has he forgotten about them, and not do anything to
    them. For the time being, his life will be devoted to raiding the Mayan cities.
    In other news, the Buccanneer capital is growing quite well, while many of their
    small island cities aren’t growing quite as well. Maybe living off the sea has
    its limits.

  narration: The Inuit have made a friendship with Canada, which encases the Sioux
    and Blackfoot to the north. Also, Canada has struck at Itazipcho, which will fall
    quickly, but then again, it is a one pop city. The Canadian army contains the
    most advanced units, muskets, trebuchets and crossbows, while the Sioux are defending
    with a smaller, more outdted military, as well as fighting on multiple fronts.
    Not great news for the Sioux, but that isn’t new.

  narration: The Ice Sheet Fleet has claimed its first new victim, Sendai. It isn’t
    the best city, although that fleet is pretty big, almost as large as an ice sheet.
    All of Japan is coastal, and it could all fall victim to the fleet, although peace
    would likely come before that. The Yakutians watch off to the side, still drowsy
    after all these centuries, When will things change, Tygyn Darkhan (leader of Yakutia),
    when? Speaking of things not changing, there are no new wars so far this year.

  narration: |-
    The revolution has hit. No, not rebels or  a war, our first entry to the Industrial Revolution has hit, and it is from Afghanistan. A time of coal and destruction of the atmosphere.  It seems rather strange that Afghanistan got here first, granted their small population. Maybe Afghanistan is a place of great scientists, or maybe they just rushed something.
    Away from the side feed, we look at the map, and see Timur standing up for himself. The attackers have not advanced passed Tus and Ghazni, although there is still mass fighting in those regions. Afghanistan’s help is needed for Sibir, except Timur has allied the greatest power of them all, the mountains.

  narration: Multan has been recaptured in the current turn. This does not seem like
    a long term thing, Sibir has a pretty large military to the north of the captured
    city.  The unmoving force near the capital has not moved however, maybe it’s the
    personal guards of Timur?  The Sibir military also has thinned, it might be time
    to start discussing peace, but not before grayscaling that Multan city that has
    bust been recoloured. Armenia has decided to be nice, and leave the war, as the
    were just being a pest, and not really putting together an effective attack across
    the Caspian.

    I may not have noticed earlier, but Arabia is indeed at war with the Ayyubids. The are attacking the hometown of Israel’s ruler, David, who was born in Bethelem before it was founded. When he grew older, and watched the city fall to his foes, he decided to not allow anyone to know that he was from there, change was needed, so he rewrote everything to make him from Jerusalem.
    The main focus of the screenshot is everyone but Ethiopia is actually fighting the war, and Ethiopia seems to be who started this. Maybe there’s some greater meaning to that. Anyways, Gondar is taking damage, the Carthaginian region is filled with bloodshed, and Israel is out of sight. Also, the Boers pointlessly take shots at Sparta, knowing full well that they can’t do anything about it.

    I find it rather funny that the Kongo is not defending their south, and attacking someone up north. Settled cities are significantly more productive than captured cities. Kongo most definitely has a unit carpet, one of the few in the world, however reinforcing through a thin strip, while the attacker has multiple tiles will never be good for the defender, making the defensive advantage much smaller.
    Where Saint Helena should be, there instead is a trapped Boer trireme and swordsman, trapped behind a scout. For no apparent reason, this is incredibly funny to myself. Its not like killing the scout will alert the Zulu, they are just a militaristic tribe with no oceanwide services.

    France and Ireland have declared war on England. One of the largest developments since the Ayyubid coalition, this is a major event. The development of longbowmen since the last Irish war is by no means insignificant, but horsemen versus pikemen is not good. On the other hand, France is now fighting a two front war between England and Germany.
    On the isles, the war is pretty even. England has the tech advantage on the seas, not by much, but Ireland has a much larger navy. On land, I have to give the Irish the advantage, because of the citadels, causing damage every decade to every units around. England has longbowmen, but they don’t have many of them near Canterbury and London. I think this will be a pretty even war in the end.

    nation. Seems like the sea is good eatings. None of the other candidates are surprising
    at all.

  narration: The bottom of the pool, contains cellar dwellers, Philippines, Byzantium
    and the Maya. I’m surprised Poland is down here, granted their size and lack of
    combat in recent years.

  narration: Land Area. Your top candidates for victory are here, I’d say the weakest
    ones here are the Maori, however they do have a really high population

  narration: The expected people down here, and again, I must have overestimated Poland’s
    strength, they are much smaller than I thought. Philippines, Byzantium, etc. all
    expected.

  narration: Happiness is not the most useful stat, in one of these games, shown by
    Burma, a rather weak nation being on top. Boers, Canada, Yakutia and Afghanistan
    are strong, but then we get back in to weaker civ’s, with Carthage, Mexico and
    Armenia.

  narration: Tech lead by Korea, Australia and Yakutia, as they have been all game.
    The Maori are peeking their head in, they look to climb with all their population.

  narration: Of the alive civs, Byzantium is tied with a dead civ. That’s never good.
    Again, many of the bottom-dwellers are shown here, possible exceptions being the
    Inca and Arabia, two somewhat capable turtles.

  narration: Inuit have the lead for cities, with Australia close behind. However,
    they are mostly useless snow/tundra/one tile island cities, and is a case of diminishing
    returns. The Boers have mostly decent cities, and I think they would lead in most
    actually effective cities. Sibir, Yakutia and Canada all have plenty of ice/tundra
    cities as well.

  narration: Again, more of the same candidates, the only new one here being Mughals,
    and they have higher population.

  narration: A look at religion. There seems to be 4 tiers, Judaism and Catholiscism,
    in Europe/North Africa/Middle East, and the Americas respectively. The mid-tier
    religion of Oriental Orthodoxy has to fight Judaism, causing smaller size, while
    Akatt-U has to fight two smaller religions of the far east. Islam is all but gone,
    trapped between two religions.

    Here is a city religion map, and that’s it for this part.
    Thanks for reading Part 19 of the Civ Battle Royale, written by /u/jlim201. Thanks for letting me narrate TPang!
