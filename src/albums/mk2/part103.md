  narration: |-
    Welcome to an especially momentous installment of the r/Civ Civilization Battle Royale! I am former Power Ranker and analyst /u/bluesox, moderator of this wonderful sub as well as /r/civrapbattleroyale (currently hosting its fifth tournament), and I am delighted to narrate what is sure to be an action-packed episode. I’ll be narrating as I go along to keep my reactions (and possible miscalculations) genuine and authentic.
    We left off Part 102 with a new coalition against the Boers, led by Brazil. This image, brought to us by current Power Ranker /u/edse1991, illustrates the current mood perfectly.

  narration: 'Brazil stays at #1, and have chosen to take on Kruger to eliminate any
    threat from him reclaiming the top spot. Whether he can complete the task remains
    to be seen. The Boers have been absolutely ruthless in past wars, and with control
    over the Statue of Liberty, their production is nearing an all-time high.'

  narration: As always, we get another fantastic tile-accurate map from resident cartographer
    and Iceland supporter /u/DerErlenkonig. New additions this time around include
    some bordergore in the Indian region. With the way Brazilian troops are scattered
    around the cylinder, it’s certain to only get worse from here.

    The gorgeous City and Puppet Map, provided by /u/Spherical_Melon, shows how quickly the Boers annexed their new Asian holdings. I’m always curious as to why civs would hold cities as puppets for millenia. Some of them were captured hundreds of turns ago, and yet were never deemed worthy of annexing.
    But that’s of no importance right now. The people want action, so let’s give them what they want! We have a legit World War on our hands!

  narration: With all the fervor over the clash in Africa, let us not forget that
    other conflicts still rage across the cylinder, or at least they were. Having
    finally been pushed out of his Asian outpost of Olangapo by the Trung Sisters,
    Crowfoot agrees to peace without delivering any extra cities in the deal. Vietnam
    continues to be underestimated by the sub, and have been able to fight back against
    overwhelming odds in the past. This conflict was much easier for them, and the
    comparatively low-tech Blackfoot were shaken off like a bad case of fleas.

  narration: |-
    More importantly, though, Vietnam also puts their war with Sibir on hold to focus on the greater threat at hand. Looking at the difference in city defense, coupled with the natural terrain, I don’t see the landscape changing here without considerable loss of manpower. This is a good time for Vietnam to set the meatgrinder to neutral, seeing as they still control Urgench. This is also great news for the sub, as we will be spared several shots of border cities flipping back and forth, allowing us to focus on the bloodshed that’s sure to come in the Middle East and North Africa.
    Looking at the upper right corner, it seems that Mongolia has bee-lined hovertanks, which will help delay future invasions. It remains to be seen how long that will last, but we have more important matters to attend to!

  narration: "Brazil takes Colombo from the Boers! This city has been criminally overlooked
    in the past. This conquest is instrumental in overcoming Kruger’s defenses. Colombo
    contains the Statue of Zeus, providing an extra 15% Combat Strength when attacking
    cities, giving Brazilian units a fighting chance against the Boer fortresses.
    Whether Pedro can hold it remains to be seen. Biotroopers are attacking from all
    sides, and the resident garrison is at death’s door. I expect this city to flip
    several times, being key to either side’s victory in this battle. \nLooking northward,
    Brazil has wisely brought some airpower to Trincomalee to help support their amphibious
    assaults. It’s a good thing, too, as it doesn’t seem like Vietnam wants to engage
    just yet. Perhaps the Trungs are waiting for Kruger and Pedro to wear each other
    down before sweeping in for the easy city snipes. Of course, they’ll need more
    than a single melee unit to achieve that. Oh, bias."
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene08.jpg
  narration: Here we see how the end of Open Borders with the Boers hasn’t completely
    neutered the Brazilian assault. Kruger’s Asian holdings were barely manned, making
    easy targets for the zerg rush raining down from the northeast. Pedro is going
    to need every single one of these displaced troops, by the looks of it. The disparity
    in damaged units shows just how effective an established airforce is in this game.
    Every unit surrounding Balkh is in the yellow, while the line of Boer troops leading
    southward to Lahore is relatively strong. Speaking of which, I spot four melee
    units surrounding Lahore! This must be a new record. Has this coalition finally
    cracked the hidden code contained within How To Fight Wars Good?
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene09.jpg
  narration: |-
    Turning toward the Middle East, the brilliance of Brazil’s X-COM bias becomes apparent. They are able to quickly return many men to their previous positions in Boer territory while inundating the border cities. Sibir’s presence in this coalition seems to be purely for air support, as they hold all ground units close to home. However, a timely strike could help them reclaim Ghazni.
    Persepolis looks sure to fall to the Boers next turn, which may be a price worth paying. Turn 188 will be a make or break moment for Brazil. There are (count them) SIX undefended Boer cities in this slide, with defenses ranging from 139 to 182. More importantly, the majority of visible Boer airforce is in the least defensible cities. 8 aircraft reside in 3-pop Nova Iguacu, which is near death as it is. 5 more aircraft are stationed in 29-pop Artashat, a city that has been COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF from reinforcement. This is the textbook definition of a surgical strike. I’m so thrilled to be witness to it that I can’t stop smiling.

  narration: |-
    In Iberia, Brazil pummel what long has been (and perhaps still is) the cylinder’s most populous city of Porto, at a whopping 82.5 million. To put it in perspective, there are only 15 countries in the real world with a higher population. Assuming Brazil’s cultural influence is low, that means over 40 million are about to die! WHEE!
    The Mediterranean Sea is another story. Iceland is “helping” (in the Ralph Wiggum sense of the word) by attempting to build a land bridge between Funchal and Rome out of sunken troops. But honestly, even though it’s easy to poke fun at them, this shows just how much better the AI is than we dare to give it credit for. The Boers are ignoring the ranged naval units and choosing to single out all of the embarked melee troops. Also, Brazil and Iceland have created a barricade to separate the Sea into two theaters. I think it’s finally time to drop the “#justAIthings” attitude after seeing how well this war is being fought by both sides on the first turn alone.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene11.jpg
  narration: |-
    In the Sahara, we get a look at just how devastating the eviction from Africa was to Pedro’s chances of assured victory. Nearly every open tile here was occupied by a Brazilian corpsman. By pushing from the border, these cities have time to grow in size, strength, and production. The powerhouse Boers we remember from before the reboot are only a few turns away. None of the cities they held after annihilating Ethiopia are even in contention yet. It may sound like a prediction now, but I promise you that in ten turns this will be a menacing sea of orange. Look closer at the line across the upper left for proof. Those aren’t workers. They’re Biotroopers. Kruger has sent a double-row firing squad to remove Iceland from Africa. It would have been even more devastating, but it appears that someone nuked Quarzazate!
    I see Ingolfúr being the real sucker here. He’s taking the brunt of the damage from Kruger, and it will only make him a tastier target for Ekeuhnick in the end. I hate to say it, Iceland fans, but you better start scouting a second civ to root for now. The sooner you accept it, the easier it will be.  I would love to be proven wrong, though. We can only wait and see what Nebby has in store.
    Side note: Morgan is turtling like a boss here. He has THREE Giant Death Robots surrounding Bamako.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene12.jpg
  narration: Ah, paradiso! By this point, native Brazilians have lived for generations
    without an enemy unit in sight. I doubt they’ll be seeing one any time soon, either.
    Just look at that airforce. Nearly every city on this slide is maxed out with
    what I can only assume are missiles, given Pedro’s nuclear bias. Another reason
    why this war was meant to be fought is the way the Boers have to attack Brazil.
    They have literally ZERO presence in the Americas, meaning a naval invasion is
    necessary. Scores of ships can be sunk with a single warhead. Pedro is practically
    untouchable. It’s like he was given a full court to play half-court ball. He’s
    playing Eagle with eleven men. He’s playing wiffle ball with a tennis racket.
    He’s… you get the picture. It’s a good thing for him, too. Those Paratroopers
    wouldn’t hold up against a proper invasion.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene13.jpg
  narration: |-
    YEEEEEAHHHH! Our bloodlust continues to be satiated with the incineration of Yeji, giving the Buccaneer mech spider a luscious tan. That answers a long-standing question I’ve had, and it seems that the Bucs do have an Open Borders agreement. But that’s another 15 million casualties added to the heap (assuming bunkers were constructed), and we’re only starting to see the second turn of this war. A couple more of those and one of the nearby Buc settlers might be able to swoop in and fill the void left behind.
    At the top edge of the frame, a Brazilian X-COM is positioned to capture Fort-de-France. Can it hold out long enough to finish the job, or will it be cleaved by a Giant Death Robot laser first. Speaking of which, the ubiquity of GDR’s at this stage of the game is encouraging. The end-game is approaching quickly!
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene14.jpg
  narration: It’s been a long time since we’ve seen the Kongolese heartland. It’s
    been said before, the but the effect of the Great Famine is punctuated here. M’banza-Kongo
    was near 50 pop about 100 turns ago, and now it’s down to 42. For those of us
    who remember this region as an impenetrable core, this is a stark contrast. Conquest
    here actually seems somewhat possible. Everything I said earlier about their tremendous
    production capabilities is now dampened by this revelation. Notably, the Boers
    were spread so thin by the Brazilian occupation that they have to leave nearly
    every city on-screen undefended to address the conflicts at their borders. Could
    this finally be the end of Skynet?
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene15.jpg
  narration: |-
    Kruger is taking it from all sides, as a new shade of orange dons Madagascar. Heidelberg, which I assume is the production center of Boer “power crystals”, now glows with the charred corpses of another 17 million Boer cybernauts. Looking at the perimeter, it seems the Trungs are now the ones who knock. A lone Australian digger watches from a distance, paralyzed as flashbacks of Te Rauapraha’s last stand replay in his mind’s eye.
    To the north, a cluster of Robot Infantry gather outside Potchefstroom, but for what purpose? Perhaps they’re mobilizing to retaliate against the northern invasion.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene16.jpg
  narration: Nowhere is safe! Even the icy outpost of Looma is suffering damage as
    what I believe to be Vietnam takes a couple of potshots from a distance. There
    are naval units from four coalition members here, so it could realistically have
    been any one of them. This is a concerted effort to spread the Boers out as wide
    as possible, and so far it’s working well.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene17.jpg
  narration: |-
    As expected, Persepolis is under Brazilian control, but it doesn’t appear to last long. Looks like Kruger rushed garrisons to all these previously undefended cities in response. Brazil’s X-COMs seem to be holding up well to the retaliation, but they should be very worried about the stream of unscathed Boer Biotroopers between Jerusalem and Gaza. The perimeter they’re building will isolate this forward platoon, leaving them surrounded and doomed unless they can capitalize immediately on their position.
    Lying ahead of them is a Medina warmed by radioactive mountains, a reminder of what the Boers are capable of if sufficiently angered. Luckily for Brazil, air support appears to be rather thin here, allowing them more time to press on.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene18.jpg
  narration: |-
    Either Anuradhapura flipped in the last turn or it was nuked, leaving it at half the citizens from when we last saw it. That’s of little concern to Pedro, however, as he now controls Vavuniya, cutting off Polonnaruwa and Galle from Boer supply lines. Kalumnai also has an X-COM at full health knocking on its walls, and looking at the health of surrounding units, it also appears to have been nuked.
    A Vietnamese Robot Infantry stands outside Kandy, ready to incorporate the city into the Trung Empire should any Boer melee unit get close enough to seize it. The nearest candidates for the task are devoting their efforts to retaking Colombo, so that unit may have to find better uses of its time. Speaking of which, Pedro is leaving Colombo dangerously exposed to capture. Losing it to the Boers would be devastating to the campaign at this juncture.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene19.jpg
  narration: |-
    We finally get a view of the former Mughal homeland, a key region in this war. Boer fans should rejoice at this sight. There are 9 Boer cities in view, and only Fatehpur Sikri has taken any damage whatsoever. It doesn’t appear to be in much danger, though, seeing as how it’s surrounded by Biotroopers in good health. It just struck me that Kruger’s assimilation of Sparta may have augmented his attack formations. These arrangements seem strikingly familiar.
    Scores of Brazilian units are concentrating on Agra, and rightfully so, but it still stands tall. Notice how Kruger loves using Artillery units as garrisons. It’s an awfully bold strategy. With Pedro adding the exclave of Balkh to his possessions, new units will now appear on the front line from two directions. It’s also worth noting that Vietnam doesn’t seem too eager to send any melee units toward the vital city.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene20.jpg
  narration: And just like that, Persepolis returns to Boer control. Despite Tosont
    Sengel and Ecbatana falling to Pedro, Kruger seems to be defending particularly
    well. The line between Gaza and Jerusalem is holding strong, having even advanced
    to Ghapan. Artashat is still at full health, adding to questions about Pedro’s
    strategy. Sibir is offering no favors by blocking Brazilian troops from attacking
    from the north. It leaves one to wonder what Kuchum Khan’s end game is here.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene21.jpg
  narration: |-
    Porto is firmly within Brazilian control, and it appears Braga and Coimbra are soon to follow. With only ranged naval units at their disposal, the two cities have little means to stem an invasion. Cartographers everywhere shed a tear.
    By taking Iberia, Brazil is setting the stage for future domination. Their forward base should be very worrying to all denizens of Europe, and Iceland would be wise to do what they do best by sniping the coastal cities if at all possible.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene22.jpg
  narration: Fort-de-France continues to circle the drain, and it appears that Isit
    has flipped back and forth since the last time we saw it. Nuevitas is on its last
    legs, which would leave Marrakech, Bamako and Carthage as the only African cities
    outside the Boer Ryk. Fortunately, Iceland knows how to make melee naval units,
    or at least they did at some point. An Advanced Destroyer lies in wait in case
    the city falls. However, that may be a moot point if Brazil can move their X-COM
    into position beforehand. It also bears mentioning that Brazilian X-COMs are positioned
    to take Casablanca and Fort-de-France. Could we be witnessing the birth of Sahara
    do Brasil?
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene23.jpg
  narration: On the back page of the daily news, Natural Heritage Sites fails to pass
    yet again. Turning to more prescient matters, Brazil has a literally stupid amount
    of embarked units in the south Atlantic. Were the Boers to turn their navy westward,
    80% of the units on-screen would end up in Davy Jones’ Locker by sundown. Their
    only benefit to Brazil’s defense is causing attackers to expend their movement
    points in the process, which might allow enough time to produce an actual navy.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene24.jpg
  narration: |-
    Citizens of the cylinder decide they would rather pray to their own gods instead of taking catechism, and tell Australia to promptly fuck off with their attempt to force Jesus down everyone’s throat. I’m sure Rule 34 applies here and I’ll pass, thank you very much. Blackfoot Power Armor units sense a vague familiarity in these Catholic lands, but can’t quite pinpoint where the feeling comes from. One such troop draws a sketch of a buffalo sitting in a field before crumpling up the paper and tossing it aside.
    Of note is Korea’s achievement of peak uselessness. They’ve completed the tech tree, and now their units are all retrofitted with nowhere to go.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene25.jpg
  narration: Kruger’s defense force around Kalumnai has fled east for some reason,
    and it appears that Colombo has flipped again. That might explain why Kruger’s
    defense was so effective before. Pedro hopes to capitalize on his current situation
    before the Boer Biotrooper disembarks at the city’s perimeter.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene26.jpg
  narration: |-
    Further north, Brazil has tightened the screws on Agra by taking the city of Fatehpur Sikri. Just peeking out at the top of the screen, we can also see that they’ve taken Lahor. This is huge for them, as they now have a full front line to invade from. This also gives them the chance to cut off Vietnam from pushing forward and sniping cities if they desire by cutting off Open Borders. That would be a hugely ill-advised and dickish move, but it could serve to benefit them in the future if they’re able to hold this position.
    How Agra has managed to take zero damage so far is beyond my understanding. There must be laser mines planted in those improvements surrounding the city or something.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene27.jpg
  narration: |-
    On the other hand, Artashat is finally starting to crack. It’s too little too late, as Kruger has sent sufficient reinforcements to keep the city from falling, but it’s nice to see, if nothing else. Speaking of reinforcements, Kruger is defending magnificently here. Past conflicts were maddening to watch, with some civs throwing just a couple of support units hither and yon. Not Kruger. Every city is fully surrounded by as many troops as he can muster. By the time invaders get to the city walls, they’re already beaten down and easier to pick off.
    It’s also worth taking a look at Sweden here. In comparison to their neighbors, these cities are puny. Gustavus is very wise to sit this one out and focus on rebuilding for now.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene28.jpg
  narration: |-
    Minimap hawks have surely noticed by now that Carthage has taken on a fresh coat of paint. Somehow Pedro was able to slide in and take the city before the Boers even had a chance to plant their flag. Who’s the capital sniper now?!
    Ingolfúr is not too concerned with giving Pedro more border to share with the Boers, though. He just retook FOUR cities from Kruger. Funchal, Arretium, Sparta, and Epidauros are all now under Icelandic control. I take back that Ralph Wiggum comment. Unfortunately, Brazil doesn’t look to be in any shape to hold Carthage, and there are no melee units nearby to keep it from becoming orange for the long term.
    Fun fact: The Icelandic capture of Arretium makes it the city owned by the most civs (9).
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene29.jpg
  narration: It’s hard to tell whether these cites at 50% were nuked, flipped, or
    just plain air raided. No matter the reason, Iceland is holding the line quite
    well here. Ka-ba looks to fall into Brazilian hands soon, but the rest of Kruger’s
    cities are in no immediate danger. Now that the western flank is completely controlled
    by Iceland, there is much more room for troops to gather and push toward the Boer
    core. If only they could get there while it lasts.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene30.jpg
  narration: A moderate fleet of Brazilian troops are allowed passage through Australian
    waters by the Korean blockade. OCP members cylinder-wide cross their fingers in
    hopes that the aircraft stationed on those carriers are pointy and go boom.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene31.jpg
  narration: Persepolis once again changes hands, returning to Brazil. Ecbatana and
    Tosont Sengel appear to have flipped as well, but more important is the capture
    of Artashat. With two Robot Infantry at its walls, Kruger is eager to bring the
    city back under his banner. Should he succeed, the civ best positioned to benefit
    is Sibir, who also has a Robot Infantry camped outside of Ecbatana for when the
    time comes. Sibir’s involvement in the conflict was a smart move if Kuchum is
    able to pull off a quick expansion in the process. But that’s a pretty big “if”.
    We have yet to see any aggression from him, and there’s no guarantee he’s willing
    to exert it so far.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene32.jpg
  narration: Jerusalem has been hit hard, but Sweden provides no open passage to claim
    the city, much to the chagrin of the Brazilian paratrooper barely within range.
    It appears that Brazil may be preparing to siege Varna, but a coastal city at
    16 population wouldn’t provide much benefit to the OCP at this point. Going after
    the core as quickly as possible is the only chance they have to disrupt the balance
    of power. Iceland is trying its best by battering the city of Olympia, but it
    will need to move some melee units into place to complete the task. Fortunately
    for ingolfúr, despite having to high-pop cities in the red, there are no units
    within range that are capable of taking them.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene33.jpg
  narration: Sliding westward, we see that Kruger has taken Carthage while Pedro claims
    Coimbra for Brazil. Where the sea was once littered with orange ships, only lime
    and drab purple hues remain. If nothing else, this coalition could stop now and
    claim success by securing the safety of Europe for a while longer. I get the feeling
    that isn’t good enough for the aggressors involved, and we have a lot more excitement
    to come. Besides, Braga and Goa still need attention before that claim can properly
    be made.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene34.jpg
  narration: And now it becomes painfully clear to Sibir’s supporters why they haven’t
    been more active in the war. They have no units to send! Their entire country
    is flooded with Brazilian troops evacuated from Boer territory when the Open Borders
    agreement ended. I count eleven Sibirian ground units in this shot. For the land
    area they control, that’s embarrassing. Fortunately, any new units they create
    will most likely fill the gaps on the front lines, so they have a chance to make
    gains in this war if they focus on production.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part103-scene35.jpg
  narration: Here’s the shot I was hoping for. Iceland has once again exceeded expectations
    and sniped Ka-Ba. I didn’t even see a unit within range, but they somehow managed
    to take the city. Brazil also managed to secure Casablanca, with a decent defensive
    force to boot. In previous wars we saw the Boers take cities five or six at a
    time, eliminating rivals in one fell swoop. This time, Kruger appears to have
    finally met his match. Can the coalition take out production facilities quickly
    enough to prevent the war machine from replenishing what it has lost? With all
    those workers up north waiting to be captured, I bet Kruger really regrets forgoing
    the Digger upgrade patch. There’s an obscene amount of empty space in this shot.
    Where could all the units possibly be if they aren’t here to prevent collapse
    of the Boer core?

    What? No! That’s not how this works! That’s not how any of this works. Actually, I should know by now that it’s exactly how this works. Morgan has the best opportunity of his life to finally finish what he started, and Kekkonen ropes him into fighting alongside the Boers?! This is madness. We all remember what happened the last time Finland chose to join the wrong side of the OCP. I only hope history repeats itself so he can no longer poison the minds of men on the verge of greatness. Good luck getting your six measly units to do anything besides die, Kekkonen.
    And somehow, Hawai’i still won’t be at the bottom of the Power Rankings even if Finland is rightfully executed. Mark my words. (Oh, and Persepolis flips yet again.)

Better yet, they also took Polonnaruwa and now control the entire Indian subcontinent. If there were any naysayers before, it’s impossible to contend that Brazil deserves the number one spot in the Power Rankings. They just curbstomped Kruger out of India.

They just took Agra, adding +1 production to every specialist in all their cities and causing Tibetans to roll over in their mass graves. They have just become a key player in this war. This is devastating to the Boer war machine, but the question remains to see how the Trungs intend to use their new boost. Will they commit more troops to the war, boost defense, set up a retaliatory attack against Australia, or stockpile nukes? This just got very interesting indeed.

With enough nearby cities to provide support, he should be able to hold the city indefinitely. Kupartiya and Kabul are almost completely depleted of health, which will create a much needed buffer against any retaliation. His only concern would be if Vietnam decided to backstab him. Gathering from what we’ve seen already, that would be an ill-advised move.
    Sibir supporters are assuredly happy to see a Sibirian Biotrooper at the door of Kabul, a city that has long given them extensive headaches in the past. It looks like Kuchum is taking the “slow and steady” approach to the war.

    The Brazilian X-COM rush in the Western Sahara shows just how determined Pedro is to win this war. He’s not half-assing this at all. After what seemed like an eternity, the Boers finally look vulnerable. I know I’ve said it before, but this truly is beyond anything I’ve expected.

    They also get Epidauros and Carthage out of the deal. But that’s not all. The

    Tangier has taken a hit in the meantime. It may have been nuclear, or perhaps it’s flipped back and forth. Without being able to see the action mid-turn, it’s sometimes hard to tell. I’m sure our analysts will be able to determine the true cause of the city’s drastic drop in population.

I have to say, this is rather hilarious to me. Finland is going to get wrecked after siding with the Boers yet again, even if it was just against the Kimberley. How poetic.
    Sweden is the only one of the two aggressors close enough to do any damage, and subsequently take the huge warmongering penalty. Doing so would bring about some consequences that I don’t think they’re properly prepared for at this time. Hopefully this stays a cold war for a while.

    I was expecting a mass of reserves or at least a defensive force. Instead, the
    core is like a juicy orange, ready to be peeled and squeezed. Well, I guess the
    peeling has already begun, and Pedro’s been putting the squeeze on Kruger pretty
    hard already. What surprises me the most, though, is just how weak all of these

    practically nobody there to contest him on either front. Pedro is unstoppable
    at this point. I firmly believe that we will look back on this war as the beginning

    definitely was nuked, though. And now Yerevan also glows a hideous shade of orange.
    It’s fitting that with the Super Bowl coming up, Kruger finally decides to toss
    the nuclear football. Looks like this fight is about to even out a bit. He’s wise
    to cut off the air support first, too. Cheeky bastard. But it’s too late. Gordium
    has fallen to Brazil, and Persepolis is yet to flip again. After that, Asia will
    be a conquest of the past for the Boers.

  narration: Batticaloa is in the black, but nobody seems too eager to actually capture
    it. Brazil takes Bayulu, and hopscotches over Najran to put on a pinch attack.
    It also looks like some units have broken through in the Middle East and are descending
    on Gaza. If Kruger wants to get nuke happy, he needs to be a lot more forceful
    than this to have any effect.

  narration: |-
    Remember way back at the beginning when I predicted this area would be a “menacing sea of orange?” I didn’t quite mean it like this. This swath of destruction along the front lines is magnificent. I can’t even tell who nuked whom here. Tangier and Jenne look like targets, but so does Saguntum, and it appears that Kongo dia Nlaza was nuked back at the start of the war.
    We now see how valuable Iceland was to the war effort. Brazil has lost Panormus, and doesn’t appear to be in any position to push forward on Utique or Saguntum after losing twenty-some-odd units to nuclear hellfire. They’ve lost a lot of momentum that Iceland could have helped them sustain. Where it goes from here remains to be seen, but we have a lot to talk about over the next week. It’s been a hell of a ride, and I couldn’t be more excited to be a part of it this time. I’m truly honored to provide this narration, and hope it was as good for you all as it was for me.
