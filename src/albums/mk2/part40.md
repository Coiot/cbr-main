  narration: 'Hello, everybody, and welcome back to another thrilling installment
    of the Civilization V Battle Royale, Mk II! I’m your narrator, /u/sonicnerd23,
    short story writer and Polandball artist extraordinaire, and I’m thrilled to be
    taking you on another journey through the wonderful (read: wartorn) world of the

  narration: First off, as usual, here’s a map of the world as of the last part courtesy
    of users /u/SylonL and /u/LacsiraxAriscal, and I’ve got to hand it to them - they’ve
    outdone themselves. Keeping on top of the chaotic warfare of the last part, where
    cities were flipped/puppeted left and right (99 city captures occurred, to be
    precise), must have been a daunting task, yet they still delivered, so props to
    them!

  narration: The curtain opens on a stagnant civ desperate to remain in the game.
    With the support of their crossbowmen, the Ayyubids retake Cairo from Carthage
    with a pikeman. It’s an admirable effort on Saladin’s part, but it’ll probably
    prove fruitless; with a rifleman poised right outside of the gates of Cairo and
    a bevy of cannons and crossbowmen to back him up, it will most definitely flip
    back by the next turn.

  narration: Heading further north, we can see that the Second Swedish-Spartan War
    has come grinding to a stalemate. After suffering from a shockingly-competent
    blitzkrieg by the Swedish AI, it seems the Spartans have finally kicked their
    war machine back into gear, fighting tooth and nail to retake Cumae and defend
    Ohrid. As a fan of Sparta since their conquest of Rome, it pains me to see how
    far they’ve fallen, but I have hope that the worst is behind them in this war.

  narration: |-
    As it turns out, the Buccaneers weren‘t as altruistic as we thought. Their 'peacekeeping' force around Cologne has moved on, opening the way for Iceland to take it for themselves, and let’s be real here: they’re going to take it. Both of the Naus previously defending the city now fly Icelandic colors, and their riflemen are either garrisoned in the city and waiting for the end or on a suicide mission to London (seriously, how did they get over there?!).
    While we’re focusing on the English Channel, I’d also like to make note of France’s lack of any real naval defense. They still have galleasses at a time where most navies have upgraded into frigate or even battleships. York and Orleans especially look like juicy targets, and Paris isn’t that far away. If Iceland were to declare war on France now, they could win big.

  narration: Meanwhile, in North America, the White Walkers march onward. Charlottetown
    flips back to the Inuit while Quebec City looks ripe for the taking. However,
    the Canadians remain resolute in their defense, sending a sizeable force of riflemen
    to take back Charlottetown. I’ve gotta hand it to Canada - despite combating the
    technologically-superior White Walker army (which is now boasting HELICOPTERS),
    they’ve managed to put up a competent defense and keep their core cities safe.
    Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the same can be said of the Texans; their
    forces sent to retake Yankton have been wiped out and Baltimore and Corpus Christi
    are looking quite vulnerable right now.

  narration: The Great Oceanian War continues to heat up as, in spite of their naval
    victories, the Kimberley are being swamped by Diggers. A sizeable Australian carpet
    has lain siege to the major Kimberley city of Kalumburu. With only minor resistance
    in their way in the form of two Kimberley Great War Infantry and a few artillery
    units, the Australians are sure to take it, though it will probably flip a few
    times afterwards thanks to the massive Kimberley navy that has gathered near the
    city.

  narration: As expected, Carthage retakes Cairo, and, with their nearest melee unit
    being three tiles away, it seems unlikely that the Ayyubids are going to be able
    to flip it again. To make matters worse, the Carthaginian Army continues to press
    forward, threatening the city of Aswan.
- scene_number: '09'

  narration: Hey, guys, remember when South America was known in the BR for being
    irrelevant? Brazil and Chile do, and hoo boy, are they working hard to eliminate
    that stereotype! Argentina, which just a few parts ago was competently fighting
    the Inca, has been absolutely steamrolled. The Brazilians now march on Evita’s
    final city. Hope your F keys are primed, folks - the Argentinians don’t look to
    be around for much longer. Meanwhile, the Chilean Backdoor Squad continues to
    assault Incan coastal cities, though they’ve been kicked out of Vitcos and they
    look in dire need of reinforcements.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part40-scene10.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: As the Chileans retake Vitcos once again, we turn our attention to the
    frozen steppes of the Sibir Khanate, which, in the turns following their decisive
    war against the Soviet Union, has rebuilt and modernized its intimidating army,
    producing landships en masse. What’s interesting about this slide, though, is
    that a Mongol army appears to be passing through. Where they’re going with such
    an outdated army is a mystery to anyone; it would be hard for them to march on
    Lhasa without artillery and they would get curbstomped by any other power in the
    immediate region.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part40-scene11.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: In the western half of the Sibir Khanate, we see exactly how wide the
    technological disparity is between Kuchum Khan and his neighbors. The only civ
    that looks to stand a chance against an invading Sibir army is Afghanistan, and
    even then, they would probably take massive casualties, which would ripen them
    up for an assault by other civs like Vietnam or Sri Lanka.

  narration: NO. OH MY GOD. UNBELIEVEABLE. Not one to be outdone by the Maori, The
    Blackfoot take Olongapo right out from under the nose of the Vietnamese and then
    immediately peace out with Champa, securing themselves an island on the other
    side of the Pacific. Welp. I can honestly say that I didn’t see THAT coming. Now,
    the question is, will the Blackfoot use this city as a forward operating base
    for future conflict, as the Maori have done for Uxmal, or will they just let it
    be a sitting duck?

  narration: The Great Oceanian War rages on as the Kimberley stubbornly flip back
    a number of cities. While the Kimberley still has a good number of land forces
    to combat the Australian horde, they are rapidly dwindling. The massive Kimberley
    army that popped up out of nowhere in the last part is a ghost of its former self.
    Only a few Great War Infantry near Sunshine Coast are what remain of it. Do the
    Kimberley have the production to keep up their defenses?
- scene_number: "15"

  narration: As Carthaginian riflemen move to defend Cairo from Ayyubid relief forces,
    they continue to push on Aswan. Unfortunately for the Ayyubids, the only way they
    can send reinforcements from Zabid and Baalbek is through narrow, one tile gaps,
    and with Carthage’s wall of crossbowmen to the north of Aswan, this looks like
    a difficult, if not impossible, endeavor indeed.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part40-scene16.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: Meanwhile, the Boers continue to- WOAH! The Boers have Modern Armor!
    Not just your standard, old run-of-the-mill tanks, but Modern Armor! As if it
    weren’t clear already, the Boers have become the undisputed masters of land warfare
    due to their ridiculous tech advantage. Any war they declare against their neighbors
    is sure to be over in a few turns.

  narration: 'As the Chilean Backdoor Squad reinforces itself and retakes Vitcos,
    the Brazilians bring La Rioja down to a small sliver of health with a cavalry
    unit on its doorstep. Argentina fans, take a good, long look: this is the last
    you’re ever going to see of Evita.'

  narration: |-
    Semiramis does a little snooping around Reykjavik and discovers plans for an Icelandic invasion of Osaka. Knowing the impracticality of such a plan, she has a hearty chuckle before making note of it and digging deeper.
    Also in this screenshot, we see the Japanese theater of the Great Oceanian War. From what we’ve seen thus far, it’s been pretty silent, but now that the Vietnamese have finally discovered Dynamite, their cannon carpet has become an artillery carpet, which will help tremendously with securing the waters around this area, should the Vietnamese Navy make a committed push. It’s also apparent the Koreans have continued beelining techs to make nukes, fielding AA guns and machine guns (Ballistics), paratroopers (Radar), and bazookas (Nuclear Fission itself). At this rate, it won’t be long until we see Korean nukes. Plus, look at that submarine carpet! I have a feeling Parkes won’t want to mess with Korea again for a long time…

  narration: 'Bidyadanga flips, giving the Kimberley the defensive advantage once
    again. It begs the question: how strong is this Red Fort that it’s able to withstand
    this many city flips and still be standing? I don’t care if that fort is made
    of titanium, it should be a non-fort at this point. In the north, the bitter battle
    for Kalumbru continues.'

  narration: The Texans finally manage to retake Yankton, which looks to be in safe
    hands for now. The closest Inuit unit capable of taking cities is in Sihasapa.
    Now would be a good time for the Texans to sue for peace, but I don’t think the
    Inuit are quite exhausted yet. The Regina-Charlottetown line remains at a stalemate,
    with the Inuit poised to flip Regina once more.

  narration: The Vietnamese fleet descends upon Caloocan, hoping to reunite the island
    of Luzon for the first time since the gangbang of the Phillippines. While it is
    a great strategic target (there are six planes stationed in the city), three of
    their own cities stand at 0 HP and the Australians are sending in reinforcements
    from Japan. If the Vietnamese are not careful these next few turns, they may have
    to divert some of their forces towards flipping lost cities back, which could
    cost them in the long run.

  narration: Meanwhile, Ishtar discovers that the Inuit, not satisfied with their
    new lands in North America, are looking to send their troops on a permanent, tropical
    vacation to Burma.  Of course, the relevance of such a discovery is diminished
    by the several other borders in between the two civs.

  narration: The Kimberley’s Antarctic colonies once again secure, Jandamarra recalls
    the naval forces stationed there back to the mainland for obvious reasons. Meanwhile,
    ships off all different varieties and civs explore the Arctic Ocean. A Champan
    Great Musician, fleeing the wars that ravage his homeland, sails south to find
    artistic inspiration in the frigid wastes of Antarctica.

  narration: The Ayyubids, stubborn to the end, once again retake Cairo. With another
    pikeman. This is starting to get a little insane. Credit where credit’s due, they’re
    making the most of what they’ve got, but soon they won’t have that much left.

  narration: The White Walkers make another forceful push, retaking Yankton and damaging
    Corpus Christie on the Texan front, and breaking through the Regina-Charlottetown
    line to take Quebec City again. While the Canadians and Texans are far from broken,
    the Inuit appear to be committing more to their war effort. Now, it’s all a matter
    of whether or not the Canadians and Texans can handle the extra pressure.
- scene_number: "26"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part40-scene26.jpg?format=webp&quality=80
  narration: The ravaged Arctic hellhole of Kiyaksa remains in Canadian hands, despite
    sitting at 0 HP. I’ll admit, for as awful it is as a city, it’s pretty defensible.
    The only point of access for melee units is the two land tiles to its side and
    the one water tile in front of it (assuming you’re attacking with embarked units),
    the southern approach by land is in front of a one-tile pass flanked by a citadel,
    and to top it all off, it’s built on a hill. To make matters worse for the Inuit,
    the Canadians have two artillery units stationed outside the city. The White Walkers
    are going to be hard-pressed to send in a unit actually capable of taking the
    city (*coughNOTHELICOPTERScough*).

  narration: |-
    And thus, we say goodbye to Eva Peron’s Argentina. Argentina was hugely hampered at the beginning of the game by their being trapped between Chile in the south and the Brazilians and Inca to the north. From there, they did a decidedly average job until Chile declared war on them and took away Buenos Aires. Things were thought to be looking up for them when they, with Brazilian aid, pushed on the Inca, but this unfortunately turned out to be bait, as the Brazilians brutally and efficiently backstabbed them not even a few turns later. Evita will pass on, but don’t cry for her, Argentina fans. You know she’ll never leave you - the great artist and musician left behind will make sure her memory carries on.

  narration: The Australians mount a massive offensive against their foes, taking
    no less than five cities combined from Vietnam and the Kimberley. Undoubtedly,
    many of these cities, the Kimberley ones especially, will flip back, but the Australian
    Digger carpet still looks mighty intimidating whilst the Kimberley forces continue
    to be ground down.

  narration: On the Indonesian front, the Australians have flipped Orange and Yungngora.
    While the Kimberley, with their Great War Bombers and destroyers, will almost
    certainly take back Yungngora, a bunch of Australian artillery block the approach
    to Orange by land and there look to be no Kimberley ships in the immediate vicinity.
    Geelong also looks dangerously close to falling back to the Australians, with
    the only thing standing in between it and an approaching land force being a lone
    Great War Infantry.

  narration: Meanwhile, the East China Sea (or rather, the East Vietnam Sea) is firmly
    in the hands of the Vietnamese navy. Hoi An has recovered all of its health and
    the Vietnamese are now pushing to retake the cities lost during the recent Australian
    offensive. Caloocan has also taken a hefty amount of damage, and if the Vietnamese
    submarines can hold off the approaching reinforcements from the Japanese islands,
    it’s as good as theirs.

  narration: As the crossbow garrison at Aswan says their final prayers, a Great Musician
    near Baalbek composes a lament for solo voice and violin quartet in their honor.
    Speaking of Great People, it’s worth noting that, 1., The Ayyubids have a Great
    General, but he’s nowhere near the frontlines and, 2., The Ayyubids have a Great
    Engineer, and he’s right on the frontlines. Sorry, Saladin, but no amount of brick
    and mortar is going to save your hide now.

  narration: The Buccaneers, having caught wind of the Boers’ experiments in Africa,
    decide they want in on some of that action themselves and push forward into the
    Atomic Era. If you think about it, Henry Morgan is this world’s version of Big
    Boss from the Metal Gear series. They both have (or had) their bases of operation
    in the Caribbean, they both rule over a nation of renegade soldiers, they both
    are able to project power miles from their bases of operation, and now, it seems
    they both buy into the idea of nuclear deterrence. All Morgan needs to do now
    is construct a Giant Death Robot and he’s good to go.

  narration: The Yakuts, not to be outdone by a bunch of pirates, enter into the Atomic
    Era themselves. Despite their hibernation since their war with Japan, Yakutia
    has been doing a decent job in keeping their military up to date. Unfortunately
    for them, tech isn’t everything; judging by this screenshot, they have far more
    workers than they do land military units.

  narration: As their neighbors the Mughals enter into the Modern Era, Burma is looking
    decidedly Renaissance. It’s evident they’re past it, as per the Gatling Gun garrisoned
    in Rangoon, but compared to their neighbors, they’re lightweight. If Vietnam,
    Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, or even the Mughals were to invade right now, it’s certain
    that Burma wouldn’t come out on top. Their best bet right now is to DoW the Champa
    and snipe some cities before Vietnam gobbles them all up.

  narration: Fresh off the acquisition of their first overseas territory, the Blackfoot
    declare war on the Inca, hoping to create an empire in which the sun never sets.
    By the looks of things, though, it doesn’t look like they have much of an army
    to commit to this war, let alone much of an army in general. If the Mexicans decided
    that they wanted a piece of the Blackfoot, they could very well find some success.

  narration: The Kimberley now have landships! This should help them hold the line
    against the Australians a bit more. Now if they could pump them out en masse like
    the Boers or Sibir, that would be ideal. Unfortunately, I don’t think their production
    is that up to snuff… Do they still have anything left in their treasury?

  narration: |-
    What do you do when your infantry UU isn’t good at capturing cities? Capture them with literally anything else, apparently, including an AA gun. As Cebu and Manila are recaptured, Vietnam continues to put pressure on Australia around Luzon, scattering their reinforcement fleet and bringing Caloocan down to red. At this point, it looks sure to fall. I only hope for their own sake the Australians remember to move their aircraft and carriers when it does.

  narration: Apparently, when TPang wasn’t looking, Chile had declared war on Brazil,
    presumably because of that huge diplo hit that came with eliminating Argentina,
    and blitzed two of their captured Argentinian cities. Pedro counters this by blitzing
    those cities right back and marching on Buenos Aires. Now, it’s on like Donkey
    Kong. Pedro needs to tread carefully - those freshly-conquered Argentinian cities,
    especially La Rioja, could end up being a detriment to him if he doesn’t garrison
    them properly.

  narration: As the Kimberley landship sees its first taste of combat against an enemy
    Digger, it looks as though the Kimberley are making a concerted push against the
    Australian carpet. Will it succeed? ...Probably not. Still, it’s fascinating;
    this war has gone on for a while now, and so far, the Australians haven’t dealt
    a single point of damage to the Kimberley capital. That just goes to show how
    tenacious the Kimberley’s defense has been.

  narration: We return to the Spartan core, where fighting between the Swedes and
    the Spartans continues just outside of Ohrid and Cumae. By the looks of things,
    Sparta may just be able to hang on. Even if they don’t have planes, they still
    have a considerable number of riflemen and privateers left to throw at the Swedish
    army. If they can just retake Cumae and peace out now, maybe - just maybe - they
    can turtle, rebuild, tech up, and eventually get to a point where they can at
    least gain parity with the other Mediterranean powers.

  narration: |-
    Further north, we can see Swedish Central Europe, as well as an impressive Swedish fleet, which is now boasting carriers. It’s curious - despite clearly having Electronics and its prerequisite techs, we’ve not yet seen Swedish GWIs or battleships. You’d think, what, with the war with Sparta, they’d be trying to get a leg up on the competition by upgrading their forces, but then again, this is the same game where Sri Lanka had a carpet of triremes for the longest time, so I suppose it isn’t that farfetched.
    Elsewhere in this shot, Cologne is on its last legs as a galleass and cannon try desperately to fend off the Polar Vortex, and we catch our first glimpse in France of Napoleon’s other UU, the Cheveau-lèger, a lancer replacement that has +2 additional movement and a 33% attack bonus when below 50% health. It’s a pretty cool unit; shame Napoleon’s AI doesn’t appear to want to put it to the test.

  narration: Still further north, we can see Sweden proper, but something seems to
    be missing, namely military units. It seems that they’ve committed most of their
    forces to the Spartan war, leaving some of their most vital cities (and Gdansk)
    completely exposed to, say, a carpet of Finnish Paratruupers. Gustavus Adolphus
    better be praying that Kekkonen’s attention is currently elsewhere.

  narration: The Mughals, inspired by the stories they’ve heard of America’s valiant
    last stand, decide to take up the Freedom ideology in their honor. Ultimately,
    this isn’t going to be doing them any favors; they’re flanked by both an Order
    civ and an Autocracy civ, both of which are technologically superior to them.
    Do I sense a Poland 1939 scenario happening in the near future?

  narration: Oh, snap, here we go! Henry Morgan pulls another one of his dual DoWs,
    this time taking on both Brazil and the Inca and allying with Chile in a war that
    has the potential to become as bloody as the Great Oceanian War. That same turn,
    he takes Huamanga down to half health and sends a bunch of corsairs to meet the
    Brazilian fleet in battle. If you ask me, though, Henry should make it a priority
    of his to upgrade his corsairs ASAP. Sail ship carpets only go so far. Just ask
    Australia. Also, he should probably get some actual melee units to his holdings
    in South America; they look seriously barren.

    the phone, is that a Nau? This is, like, the third civ other than Portugal itself
    to have one of those things in their own fleet. I suppose that’s what happens
    when the AIs get privateer happy: naval UUs aren’t necessarily UUs anymore.'

  narration: Vietnam makes some headway in both of their wars, seizing Caloocan and
    Kauthara. Both cities are likely to flip a few more times, but it’s likely the
    Trung Sisters have the forces to keep flipping them. It’s honestly surprising
    how quickly the Vietnamese were able to turn around their war with the Australians
    with just a few submarines. Still, it remains to be seen whether or not they will
    gain anything significant from this war. Sure, Caloocan was a decently-sized city,
    but meanwhile, the Australians are taking huge chunks out of the Kimberley.

    they launch a brutal counteroffensive, not only retaking Kalumbru, but also taking
    the Australian(?) city of Marseille, which up until now had been untouched by
    the war. Will it become a new battleground? Not if Prime Minister Chifley and
    his roving gang of Diggers has anything to say about it.

    just channel that into pumping out military units, they could give their neighbors
    something serious to worry about. But anyways, Trigger Darkhan now possesses the
    capability to make nukes. If his AI is the type to drop bombs like he does rhymes,
    maybe the Snoryak still has a shot at this world domination stuff.

    fleet once again makes a good showing, dominating the small Sri Lankan naval force
    sent over to the Arabian peninsula. Meanwhile, a number of Arabian Great War Infantry
    and Camel Archers take the fight to the Sri Lankans, wiping out the melee units
    stationed near Negombo and Batticaloa. I doubt the Arabians will actually end
    up capturing these two cities in the end, but this is just embarrassing for Sri
    Lanka.

    the Brazilians enter the Atomic Era. As it stands right now, their offensive against
    Chile has faltered, most likely due to the eleven bombers the Chileans have stationed
    in their northernmost cities, compared with the Brazilians’ meager five. Where
    are those Brazilwood Bombers when they’re needed the most?

    begin to arrive, and it looks like at this point, the war will end in a draw.
    The Arabian fleet is still large, but many of its ships are damaged and the Sri
    Lankans still have plenty of fresh ships only a turn or two away from the combat
    zone. In the midst of all this, wandering Soviet ships wonder what the hell they’ve
    stumbled into.

    two Ayyubid cities south of Cairo. Baalbek looks sure to fall to the mass of riflemen
    and cannons approaching it, but it appears Hannibal got lazy when plotting out
    the invasion of Zabid and sent a meager force of two crossbowmen to do the dirty
    work. Perhaps the Carthaginians will send a stronger force after Baalbek is captured?

  narration: Suddenly, a crack team of Finnish Paratruupers descends upon an unsuspecting
    Arabia! While it’s unlikely that these four units are going to capture a city
    alone (although looking at its defense, maybe Jericho could become a Finnish enclave…),
    this is a massive development, people. It used to be that any war declared by
    a civ on another civ a significant distance away was deemed “irrelevant.” Now
    that more and more civs are starting to research Radar, giving them access to
    paratroopers and long-range aircraft, we’re going to be seeing a lot more situations
    like this in future parts.

    military just across the border, the Siberian military is, like, so Modern Era.
    Sure, Kuchum’s forces are packing several GWIs, landships, and anti-aircraft guns,
    but Kekkonen’s forces have rocket artillery and mobile SAMs, meaning that Finland
    isn’t that far away from entering the Information Era. Sibir had better step up
    its game if it wants to have parity with Finland in future conflicts.

    Pueblo. Corpus Christi and Sisseton both look likely to fall, and with yet more
    Texan Great War Infantry around the corner, they’re sure to become new Yanktons.
    Texas certainly isn’t going to come out of this war the North American powerhouse
    it was a few parts ago; it’s goal now is to minimize any damage done to them..

    coastal city and bringing the rest down to yellows and reds. To make matters worse
    for the Inca, it looks as though their forces are starting to vanish, and this
    is without the Buccaneers sending in their infantry and siege units. If Bernardo
    doesn’t act fast, Chile’s not going to get anything from this war.

    defense is starting to falter, too. If Quebec City falls and the Canadians aren’t
    able to send a force to retake it in time, then Canada’s capital is going to be
    in serious danger.

    continues to push forward. Although the Kimberley current have the Red Fort in
    their possession, their forces are looking a little thin, especially their naval
    forces. They seemingly had naval dominance in the waters above Kalumburu, but
    a portion of the Grand Wobbegong Armada seems to have assumed control. In either
    case, things aren’t looking too good for the Kimberley.

    Poor Haakon can’t catch a break. First, he loses all of his cities to Sweden except two, one of which might as well be a polar bear colony. Then, he gets citadel’d by Sweden and can’t do anything about it. Now, according to Agent Em, it seems like even rulers from across the sea want to kick the guy while he’s down, as the Brazilians are caught plotting against him. Is this what he gets for being the ruler of Snoreway?
    It’s kinda cruel - we criticize AI like Indonesia, Norway, or even Yakutia for being “lazy” or “asleep,” and we don’t even stop to consider that maybe they don’t want to fight. Maybe they don’t want to cause Austin-scale bloodbaths. Maybe they just want to live their little lives inside their little virtual world and create the greatest arts, mount a successful space voyage, or bring the world together through diplomacy.

    Kalumbru, formerly a proud city of the Kimberley Empire, now stands as a broken, bloodied city firmly under the iron grip of the Australians. Now, it is Rubibi’s turn. For the entire war, it has managed to avoid taking any damage. No longer.
    But if I can make a case for the Kimberley, they might still be able to scrounge together a competent defense. There are two artillery units positioned in or next to Rubibi as well as six planes and a battleship stationed in the city. Combine all these with the defensive strength that the city has from the Red Fort, and it’s evident that the Australians are going to have a particularly bad time trying to crack this nut shell… or they could shell it to oblivion from the ocean with their frigates and newfound battleship and take it anyways.

    And finally, for the first time, we get a screenshot of the Culture Overview! As expected, the non-Autocracy civs are suffering from unhappiness issues. Thankfully for them, Diety bonuses seem to be offsetting such problems. It’s also worth noting that the Inuit currently stand at a relatively low 34 happiness - could we see the White Walkers’ advance slow next part as they capture more cities?
    And so we’ve come to the end of another part. I’d like to thank TPang for letting me narrate and for keeping the game going for as long as it has, and I’d like to thank you guys for tuning in. It’s been an exciting experience getting to narrate this part and I welcome any feedback you guys have regarding my narration. This has been /u/sonicnerd23, signing out!
