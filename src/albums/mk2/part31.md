  narration: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to another thrilling
    instalment of the Battle Royale! I‘m /u/senshidenshi, reprising my role as emergency
    narrator for this edition! This time I‘m actually going to try to keep it short
    so we can get this out on time! Yeah, we‘ll see how that goes.

  narration: "Here it is! What‘s new this issue: a LOT. From top to bottom left to
    right: some unpuppetting in Europe as Sparta take Lodz, Finland Wroclaw and Sibir
    Attila‘s Court and Beaumont into their empires. Sibir also sneak a new city (Lillehammer)
    in the old Hunnic territories. In Africa, the Boers annex Mbanza-Kongo, but none
    of the rest of the former Kongolese territories, although the population of the
    area is starting to recover. Asia‘s pretty quiet in terms of off-screen changes,
    but Australia found two new cities - Geraldton in Ozinesia, and a mystery city
    (they‘ve exhausted their city list) in Japan. Never to be outdone the Inuit found
    THREE MORE CITIES in their homelands, all of which are mysteries in terms of names.
    Seriously, it‘s getting ridiculous now. That area looks bigger on the map than
    it is in-game, and it‘s still the densest area of cities on the whole map. Canada
    annex Sihasapa (north of where Chichen Itza is) and Cincinnati joins Albany in
    being an unlikely metropolis.\nOof, I think that‘s about all! \nHere‘s the simplified
    version: http://i.imgur.com/sYHLUJq.png["

  narration: We begin today on a humorous note. Yes, despite being dead, the Huns
    move ever forwards into technological advancement.Guess there‘s not much else
    to do in the afterlife.

  narration: The Timurids look in a decent position around Ghazni. Which is a shame,
    because they and Persia have just made peace. Also note the Tumen, a Lancer replacement,
    which, among other things, is slightly less shitty against cities.

  narration: |-
    England, IRL hub of great music (or at least it used to be), attempts to keep the title in the Royale. It‘s just a shame the Irish have control over Liverpool, and England has been banished to Spain.
    That reminded me of a LOT of English songs actually. Just a same they‘re not in Andalusia.

    How do ya like me Nau?
    In all seriousness, the best thing this miniature armada could do is sell exotic goods. Don‘t try to invade a country with Artillery, folks.

    the terrible Russian snow cities. Why they‘re bothering is a mystery.

  narration: |-
    The Mughals seem to be doing quite well, despite the fact they‘re facing down rifles with swords. Must be the badass cannons.
    In all honesty, the badass cannon is probably my favourite unique unit in the game. Don‘t tell TPangs.

  narration: |-
    The Brazillians are coming.
    Already they‘re sweeping down the countryside.
    Your musketmen can only hold them for so long before your cities fall.
    Chile‘s also breaking down your door, but it‘s not your biggest concern.
    Because the Brazillians are coming.
    And they‘re going to break down all your doors.
    Or almost capture cities and sue for peace, which seems like something the AI would do.

    The Maori have entered the Modern Era.
    What can I say? It‘s been said a thousand times! I‘ve already NARRATED it before! If the Maori were somewhere else, they‘d be an overwhelming force! Next to Australia? Bam! Whelmed! Simple as that!

    Nau we‘re cooking with gas!
    They really should just trade and get out of there.

  narration: |-
    The Irish Isles. Or should I say the Icelandic Isles. Limerick falls, and Cork is soon to follow.
    I think London will be the last Irish city to go. It‘s the southernmost one not on the coast. Still, it‘ll fall like all the others. Unless Iceland is dumb and sues for peace.
    I guess you could say an Ice Age is coming? That‘s only funny if you‘re a 70‘s music nerd like me.

    Finland versus Sibir. That‘s a fight I‘d like to see.
    I also like how Finland peaced out with two nations only to immediately denounce them.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene15.jpg
  narration: |-
    Aah, Sweden‘s old Hakkapeliitta. The unique I‘m most tentative to pronounce. Notable in that it cares particularly about Great Generals, which the one TPangs has graciously highlighted for me is right next to.
    Berlin is most likely going to stay Swedish, but they‘d best get some reinforcements over near Warsaw. A half-dead rifleman isn‘t the best border patrol.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene16.jpg
  narration: |-
    I have a lot of bias towards Vietnam. It was the first civ I ever made and published, all the way back in 2014. Now I have three or four under my belt, as well as all the ones I‘ve updated. I may prefer the Boathooks as a civ, but I still have the most nostalgia for the Watermelon Warriors. God, modding seemed so complicated back then...
    Oh, yeah, and they did Broadway. I can‘t think of a good pun (my knowledge of plays is very limited, I tried Saigon with the Wind but that‘s a movie) but I can imagine the Trungs in a cheesy musical. Anyone willing to fanart that? No? Moving on.
    TPang‘s note: I guess you just MISSed a grand opportunity :P
    Senshi‘s note: As people keep reminding me.

  narration: The Buccs have finally come to terms with the fact that they can send
    armies off to battle without boats. Pacal should be quaking in his boots.

    The Brazillians are coming.
    They approach ever closer.
    Your men are dead, or dying.
    You don‘t like your chances.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene20.jpg
  narration: Kharkov is basically dead. It‘s going to fall. That one rifleman isn‘t
    going to save it.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene21.jpg
  narration: Indonesia denounces Champa. A war between them would likely be an interesting
    naval battle in South East Asia. When was the last time that happened? Champa
    vs Philippines?

    The Boers have a clear lead in literacy, followed by other top contenders. And Korea.
    And the Maori. Why the Maori? We‘ve been over this!
- scene_number: "23"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene23.jpg

    over the Ayyubids. Eh, I‘m sure it‘ll be fine. Tell the Boers I said hi.

  narration: Never mind, Sri Lanka seems to be thinning out the Mughal units. Also
    note that the infamous Sri Lankan trireme carpet is beating up caravels.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene25.jpg
  narration: Poland steals ideas from Rome (never a smart plan), sending their last
    melee units out to sea. To be honest, I don‘t think Timur is as inviting as Alexios.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene26.jpg
  narration: |-
    Limerick and Cork are Icelandic, and they seem to have a super sneaky stealth squad attacking Derry from the south. There isn‘t a music reference here. There might‘ve been one, but the narration for this slide deleted itself. Still, I like bad jokes! There has to be an invisible pun!
    Alright, that one was painful.

    to make puns with. For example: ''Isit a plane?'''

    to be honest.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene29.jpg
  narration: The Swedes gather around Lodz, but the Spartans seem to have broken into
    Warsaw. We may have a very strange scenario in a second.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene30.jpg
  narration: Ah, the Digger. Any Australian knows the Digger‘s tale, partially because
    of latent patriotism and partially because the Australian curriculum requires
    students to learn about Australian history, and the Digger‘s tale is about half
    of that. Still, they‘re cool and they get bonuses on land adjacent to coast, such
    as... most of Oceania.
- scene_number: "31"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene31.jpg
  narration: |-
    Iceland seems to be focusing all of its attention towards the Isles, and has practically abandoned its western colonies. Lincoln does not approve of this, and denounces Ingolfur Arnarson.
    I can‘t wait for us at CL to finish Greenland, then the only Viking name I‘ll need to worry about is Erik.

    down to half health in a single slide.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene34.jpg
  narration: Kharkov has lost about 56% of its population, and has become a Siberian
    enclave. Considering the Russian military presence in the area, that isn‘t likely
    to change.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene35.jpg
  narration: Yeah, you know how we psyched you earlier? Well, PSYCHE! Argentina is
    actually holding Brazil off pretty well! For now, at least.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene36.jpg
  narration: Australia may be the civ we most associate with naval dominance, but
    Korea has the technological lead in that department, boasting submarines and now
    a large cohort of ironclads. I guess you didn‘t consider the implications of kettles
    and fridges, eh, Parkesy? Thought your Esky and billycan would do just fine?
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene37.jpg
  narration: Mongolia has numbers, but Yakutia has planes. Something tells me it‘s
    a bit difficult to shoot down a triplane with a crossbow.
- scene_number: "38"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene38.jpg
  narration: As the icy ships march- well, sail, onwards to Dublin, Ingolfur gets
    cocky and thinks he‘s equipped to beat the Trungs. I mean, come on, man! Not only
    do they have a crazy cannon carpet, they‘re on the other side of the supercontinent!

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene39.jpg
  narration: |-
    Is this the beginning of the end for Pacal? Probably, yeah.
    You know, people said the Myayns foretold the apocalypse because they stopped making the calendar or whatever, but maybe they stopped making the calendar at 2012 because they got SHOT BY PIRATES?
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene40.jpg
  narration: |-
    Nau is the winter of our discontent.
    The Portuguese ships have either left or died, but there‘s more interesting things afoot. Canada is marching on America.
    A bit late to the party, to be frank. Ten parts ago they‘d be ripe for the picking, but they‘ve grown, matured. They‘re not veal any more, they‘re a fully grown bull. Except with guns.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene41.jpg
  narration: The Boers are one of, if not THE scariest civs in this game. They‘ve
    got a lot of planes, let‘s just hope we‘re not the target.
- scene_number: "42"

  narration: |-
    Australia versus Vietnam! TPangs‘ golden boy versus Senshi‘s! Neirai was not available for comment.
    The Vietnamese have a better army, but the Wobbegong Armada is not to be trifled with, especially when Nam is rocking GALLEASSES. Come on! INDONESIA has better stuff than that! Also note they have IRONCLADS, so what are they doing with that.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene44.jpg
  narration: |-
    In a typical display of Australian eldritch dominance, they beat back a few Vietnamese ironclads with a gang of Privateers. BoatCon 230 had a bit of a rocky start.
    There was a Lovecraft story set on Aus, right?

  narration: |-
    Yep, Britian is doomed. Where‘s your music now?
    Britain‘s falling, in a faraway town,
    Yes war was declared, and battle came down,
    Britain‘s falling, to the underworld
    And the next line of the song didn‘t really work
- scene_number: "46"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene46.jpg
  narration: Sibir captures the terrible Russian snow settlements, and the screen
    lights up with attrition. I don‘t know what that means.
- scene_number: "47"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene47.jpg

    Good luck getting to Lhasa, though.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene48.jpg
  narration: Igloolik is Yakutian, cutting off the Inuit from cities such as Isit.
    The Yakutians actually don‘t have that much naval presence in the area, so that
    was a wise choice.
- scene_number: "49"

  narration: The Blackfoot seem to be doing some damage to Itazipcho, although they‘ll
    need to pilot a rifleman through the hordes of Canadian ranged units to take it.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene50.jpg
  narration: Carthage and the Ayyubids make peace, both conceding they‘d rather fall
    to the Boers. Scarily enough, the Ayyubids actually almost recaptured Bilbais.
    Using Crossbowmen.

  narration: What? How aren‘t they dead yet! I wrote a song and everything! Napoleon
    was so cocky he even brought a worker in to get a head start on building improvements!
    How dare you try to prevent your own death, Lizzie? Did you make a trade agreement
    with the devil?
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part31-scene53.jpg
  narration: The Boers denounce Australia, probably due to choice of headgear. I‘m
    siding with Aus in this one. Don‘t get me wrong, I like the swanky Commando slouch
    hat, but the upturned Digger slouch hat is cooler.

    of Sibir artillery, I‘d say they‘d have a damn good chance at recapture.

  scene_title: 56

  narration: |-
    Cork is retaken, but the Ice has spreaded to the south. It won‘t be long until we have to stop calling them the Irish Isles and instead refer to them as the Icy Isles.
    I really hope Ireland recaptures now.

    Australia is blocking a strategic tile. Come on, dude, if you want to observe
    build a submarine!

  narration: And Buenos Aires falls to Chile! Doesn‘t seem like it‘ll be easy to take
    back, as well. The Brazillians look as if they‘re coming from the north. It seems
    Argentina may very well suffer the same fate as a certain OTHER gold and light
    blue civ.

  narration: No rankings this time, but we have a religion overview! Catholicism is
    in the lead, followed closely by Judaism. All the other religions are roughly
    the same, except Islam, which needs no introduction.

    p>And the grand map, a portal into an alternate reality where the Sioux dominate America, Hawaii dominates South East Asia, and the Philippines live on in Europe, brings this part to a close. I‘ve been Senshi, and I‘d just like to say, sorry for the delay, and sorry for the narration.
    As a parting gift, I‘d like to give you some backstory:
    Colonialist Legacies | TPangolin: Available to emergency narrate? :/
    S. Denshi, P.I.: Yeah, I‘m free
    Colonialist Legacies | TPangolin: Awesome
