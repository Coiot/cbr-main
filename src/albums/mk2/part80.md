  narration: Come on, come all to the international blood bath that is Civilization
    Battle Royale MkIII! I, /u/LunarNeedle, have previously narrated only one AI game
    before this and have now been tasked to put to words the most influential battle
    of the ages. As some of you might or might not know, our lovely overseer /u/TPangolin
    has shown us a declaration of war teaser dropped on the subreddit that indicates
    that our two continental powers have finally dropped the gauntlet and prepared
    to fight. But alas, this is a world of war and chaos so we know that there is
    more death, despair and way too much hovertanks.

  narration: As you can see from this beautiful constructed map by our lovely cartographer
    /u/Spherical_Melon not much has changed in the world since the pen last touched
    this map one part ago. Lisbon went the way to the Buccaneers meanwhile the Vietnam/Sibir
    war grinds on with only the Sibirian cities of Lashkar Gar and Gyumri going way
    to Vietnam. Time will tell until this map pulls a Maori and suddenly explodes
    with action, excitement and millions of people dead! For now it‘s quiet. Too quiet...

  narration: Speaking of the Spherical_Melon, he‘s also produced a beautiful Boer
    focused map for all of us that love to witness the true might of the Boer empire
    in all it‘s glory with irrelevant nations grayed out. Ah, isn‘t it good that it‘s
    so relaxing. Well, let‘s hope it isn‘t staying that way either! Start the wars!

  narration: "As you can see in the bottom right, Henry Parkes was the first person
    to drop the gauntlet to declare war on the unquestionable Power Ranking leader
    and professional cyborg that is Paul Kruger. Literally. It‘s unquestionable considering
    the solid first place position that was shared by all of our professional analysts.
    \nIt‘s easy to see why considering the successful repulsion of the OCP over the
    past dozen parts has led them to controlling most if not all of the African continent
    as well as Arabia with room to grow. It‘ll take a mountain to move them, but could
    to collective weight of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch take a dent in Kruger‘s
    unflinching robot shell?"

  narration: Back from where we left off, we can see the refugee camp constructed
    in the bombed out Finnish ruins of Batticaloa, desperately trying to build a camp
    out of recycled Ethiopian equipment, unaware of the chaotic world outside of them
    with an Artillery poised directly in the towards their once bitter enemies of
    Sri Lankashould. It seems that they were all moved to this enclave due to Open
    Border agreement not receiving reinstatement. Should the Finnish agreement expire,
    we might be seeing the Afghan military be forcibly put in far more dangerous lands…

  narration: The irradiated rum laden lands of the Buccaneer capital has changed dramatically
    since we‘ve seen it. Before, we saw five lands outside of the city center being
    actively worked on but now due to cleansing we can only see three tiles being
    actively worked on. These bountiful coastal tiles have been able to provide a
    lot for the Buccaneers in the past but with significantly less men to man the
    lands, we‘ve seen a 15 production decrease which slows down the recruitment of
    the naval forces required to defend the pirate lands from Australia. The growth
    rate has increased in this time however, meaning should the Australian armada
    become distracted, it might give some time for Buccaneer‘s to reclaim the Nassau
    canal. Thankfully for him…
- scene_number: "7"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene07.jpg
  narration: "...Henry Parkes (Australia) desires to anger the African artifice himself
    in a risky but opportunistic declaration of war on Paul Kruger of the Boer‘s!
    This is big news for the anti-Boer coalition as right now is the biggest power
    play that can stop the Boer reconstruction of North Africa. That might seem odd
    to hear be said about someone voted to be the strongest empire by every Power
    Ranker, but since the Boer‘s have been using their limited units to deal with
    Finland and the continual naval assault by the Buccaneers, his production has
    been split vastly between conquests and defense leaving his cities relatively
    bare of units. In comparison, the Australian army has been recently modernized
    and still appears competently carpeted. Should Australia aim to take a dent in
    the Boer‘s impenetrable skull, he might be able to slow the mechanized monster
    that is Paul Kruger."

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene08.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile we can see the thin line of Buccaneer defensive units consisting
    of Cybersubs, arsenal ships and a trusty settler aim to delay and halt the potential
    Australian advance into the gulf of Mexico. The strong move from Australia to
    attack the weakened city of Leogane with an Advanced Destroyer when there appears
    to be no melee units nearby means the city might be Leo-gone from Buccaneer hands
    for a few turns.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene09.jpg
  narration: In a surprising show of competence, Australia aims to use the coast just
    south of the former Mayan city of Tikal as a floating airport which means that
    they will be able to bomb Palenque and Tikal consistently as units flood in fromt
    Uxmal. The sheer variety of unique units seen in this slide showcases the true
    diversity that the Australian army possess over other major empires. If this remains
    consistent going further into the game, we might be seeing Australian landfall
    in Africa sooner than you might think! Just don‘t count your lucky stars on it,
    as this is the same country that has failed to successfully conquer Mexico since
    part 64!

  narration: |-
    Speaking of the irradiated devil, it appears that the Blackfoot‘s attempt to take the Mexican capital of Ciudad Juarez isn‘t going to be possible due to ugly orange smog that appears to be damaging units as they try to take the city. The Inuit also appear to be showing strong interest in the weakened Mexican core as they gallivant their XCOMs around while building a wall of Future World units that seems to be solidifying around the border as well. Could this be indicating an oncoming Inuit invasion?
    It‘s either that or their units are merely passing through the area. It usually is the case with Inuit nowadays, isn‘t it? Oh well, we can wish…
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene11.jpg
  narration: It appears the Paratrooper carpet has left the Blackfoot core and has
    come down in terror to the Mexican people with a surprisingly varied army! I didn‘t
    say it was particularly strong, but it‘s definitely possessing enough melee units
    to make sure that Wahpekute and Veracruz are in Blackfoot hands. The complete
    lack of any melee units aside from a single Marine means that Blackfoot will need
    to fumble this invasion for it to not result in Blackfoot having two former Mexican
    cities. That is, until the Inuit come knocking…
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene12.jpg
  narration: While the core of the Blackfoot appears to be vacant, it appears that
    they are also appear of they are getting the hint from Inuit, who are using their
    top tier production levels to turn out a surprisingly large amount of land units
    that are slowly filling up the area. It appears that my prediction of a potential
    invasion was due to them amassing their troops by the Blackfoot border, it might
    just be a natural accumulation of units overall. This is good news for Inuit supporters
    after the war with the Buccaneer‘s only left them with Cincinnati under Inuit‘s
    icy control. Should we see continual expansion of their military strength, they
    might finally have the grit needed to fight their neighbor. Maybe. Possibly. Hopefully?

  narration: |-
    Our omnipotent overseer casually flicks his hand to the right, sending the entire camera view across the Pacific to view the hallowed out Yakutian city of Beryozovo. It appears though that the sheer desire for this city has caused Korea and Mongolia to combine their armies down the choke point. With   Korean hover-tanks completely surrounding the city, it might take far more time than necessary to conquer.
    The remaining Yakutian Great Admiral looks on at the tactics being displayed by Korea and Mongolia and simply laughs, lifting his sake glass, taking a long sip from it before tossing it harshly at the deck of his civilian ship. In celebration of freedom from his sleeping overlords or respite before death, we aren‘t certain.

  narration: |-
    With a quick snap to the Boer battle for the Mediterranean, we finally begin to see why hovertanks lack of ability to capture cities will be the Boer‘s biggest Achilles heel. We can also witness the relative bareness in the Boer core, but we can begin to see new units that aren‘t hovertanks begin to be recruited. Should Australia take too long, the defense of the Madagascar coastline will be increasingly hard with each and every turn.
    The majority of North Africa in this shot appears to be fairing far better than before, with moderately large cities beginning to sprout wings, safely defended in their core. Tick tock Henry, tick tock…
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene15.jpg
  narration: Despite Australia declaring war on Boer‘s, it appears that the Boer‘s
    have already begun sending more than seven nuclear warheads directly towards the
    Australian core with a trusty Boer caravel and a destroyer blockading to the best
    of it‘s abilities from the Australian navy just south of it. If the carrier armada
    to the west is an indication of future naval strength, than Australia might be
    looking to make gains in this war, but the immediate nuclear response of the Boer‘s
    showcases the willingness of the Boer‘s to make them fight for every single inch
    in this war. The outcome might be indeterminate, but the outcome will be more
    blood!
- scene_number: "16"

  narration: Former Finland cities of Lisbon and Cienfuegos goes to the way of Henry
    Morgan (Buccaneers) while the Boer‘s secure Braga and continue to litter the battlefield
    with more and more hovertanks. Meanwhile in Cumana, the last aerial resistance
    of Drone Fighters means that every single city in Iberia aside should fear the
    drones overhead that consistently whittle down the city defenses. This part of
    the world will be witnessing tons of potential city flips should the Boer‘s manage
    to actually send in units capable of taking cities instead of throwing more and
    more hovertanks at the problem.

  narration: As the Ashanti Pikemen navigate their way out of Boer territory for the
    first time in millenia, Semiramis unveils even more plots to capture the king
    himself (thought to be hiding amongst the men in a 'No I‘m Spartacus' sort of
    way).

  narration: "In the war that no one thought was going to anywhere, it explodes in
    combat, with three cities rapidly flipping to Vietnam‘s side, claiming the former
    Afghan capital of Kabul alongside Nishapur, Carrolton and Herat. It‘s unlikely
    the latter two will remain Vietnamese as the amount of Bio-drones and the highlighted
    Mobile SAM will assure that the cities are only momentarily donning green borders.
    \nIn the image, it also appears as the amount of ranged units is decreasing, but
    with all the space near devoid of units, which unit will Vietnam opt to produce
    as warfare becomes increasingly difficult against the well fortified Sibirian
    front?"

  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part80-scene19.jpg
  narration: "In Urgench, the front tightens as more and more units try to force their
    way into the small gap that separates Urgench from Sibir. With the tactical positioning
    of one of those Great General‘s citadels, this land can easily become more and
    more easily defensible with the natural damage aura and defensive modifiers that
    are associated with the improvement can make progression towards Urgench almost
    impossible. \nBamba is the exact opposite of Urgench however, with many ways to
    attack the city is in constant threat of falling and losing the 10 aircraft stationed
    within its walls."

  narration: |-
    Two empires with vastly difference color schemes meet in the British Isles with identical priorities on construction, all containing little to no actual land units with primary of the focus on a diverse and effective navy.  In a theoretical match up, I view Ingolfur‘s (Iceland) position far more favorably than Gustavus (Sweden) due to sheer unit count in both land and sea with. Either way you slice it, a war between these two empires would be dangerous for both parties as more opportunistic neighbors grow more and more in size.
    In either case, the sheer naval effectiveness of these empires makes water locked Siberian worker shake in his boat, wishing for a way home.

    If all the stress of potential wars breaking out across the cylinder is too much for you, why not take a gentle trip to Tibetan capital of Lhasa, the beautiful mountains and the aging technology can take you back into a simpler calmer time. You may offer to worship the religion the city was the first to found of Akatt-u, or you may find yourself practicing the minority religion of Buddhism. Either way, Lhasa is the land of peace and happiness in a world ravaged by the fangs of war.
    Fun fact, every Tibetan tile has a Civilian on it.

  narration: "In a land lacking the true serenity of Lhasa, but gaining in a sense
    of protection that only the Boer‘s get to experience on a day to day basis. With
    no major powers breathing down the Brazilians necks and with the entirety of South
    America to them and Australia, they can sit and rebuild, awaiting an even more
    chaotic tomorrow. \nIn Brazilian land, you can see a fair smattering of every
    type of unit as well, showcasing the superior unit selection of the Australians
    isn‘t an isolated case, but the severe lack of naval units will become an issue
    should the Boer‘s or Australia point their sights on them."

  narration: Actually, nevermind, take that back about the superior unit selection
    as the lovely Brazillian coastline as contracted the Carrier bug from the Buccaneers
    from their latest incursion. Should this bug be contagious to Henry Parkes (Australia)
    will have more difficulty in the battle with Paul Kruger (Boers) than I originally
    predicted. Come on Brazil, you‘re better than this!

  narration: The relaxed building policies in Brazil might be due to a semi-centennial
    vacation in the least desirable locations in the world, with a sizeable chunk
    of Brazillian peacekeepers occupying the city of Tomtor. Meanwhile, it seems that
    the Mongolian army has progressed significantly away from the Helicopter Gunship
    days of old and into the days of Modern Armors. Sure, it‘s no Giant Death Robot,
    but it‘s still something!

  narration: |-
    Ah, the bare Siberian core, filled with nothing but workers and an occasional unit. I‘d imagine if you made a map based entirely off of the current real life situations, America would be full of nothing but workers, working desperately hard while their army fights far far away. I wonder if they live a nice calming life with the Knights of the Maound table. I wonder if they even know the war is going on?
    Side note: Finland‘s border gore is out of control! It‘s like someone took a can of white paint and just threw it at the world map and those tiles are result of the splatter as it contacts the surface. Cue audio-narrator for this part making a 'that‘s what my bedroom wall looks like' joke.

  narration: "Oh my lord! That‘s… a lot of units! It could be far far worse, but the
    current carpeting of Inuit is absolutely insane. They‘re really showing the Reddit
    wrong when they claimed they couldn‘t fight wars good but simply adding more gun.
    This amount of units will have no problem cutting through the blue stain on their
    continent in less than a part should they actually mobilize and attack. Oh wait,
    this is the Inuit I‘m talking about after all. Never mind then, carry on.\n[Slide
    25] Now that we‘re back to the Buccaneer death part we‘re noticing that… actually,
    wait. The Buccaneer army, lead by none other than Admiral Settler has managed
    to route the advancement and has halted the advancement of Australia with a surprising
    amount of movement, making sure that Palenque is firmly remaining in Henry Morgan‘s
    drunken grip for at least a few turns longer. \nThe movement of Morgan‘s limited
    resources has always been so fluid and clean and showcases the potential for domination
    every Civilization in this map has. This match-up remains on knife‘s edge where
    anything could happen. Could the introduction of the Chimera‘s with their improved
    speed help capture the weakened former Mayan cities?"

  narration: In a surprising error on behalf of Paul Kruger (Boers), it appears that
    he‘s set course directly for Looma without his escorts next to him. Considering
    the vastly powerful air-force that‘s stationed on all the carriers and the strength
    of the submarine‘s in tow, I doubt we‘ll be seeing any of these missles make landfall.
    This realization brought a collection ‘Aww‘ throughout the entire Babylonian sub
    who wishes to see the Australian cities glow gold once more. Calm down guys, the

    alive believe and what their intent‘s are. We expect the greatest from you, our
    loyal servants. Fetch us our celebrity news headlines! \nIn other words, the background
    showcases a bit of the core of Australia possessing a strong amount of hovertanks,

    former Finnish cities soon find themselves in the ever capable robot hands of

  narration: |-
    In a classic case of political hot air, a nation whom shares no borders plots against a weak empire. In all hilarity, it‘s amazing how easy nations whom probably have never traded can get agitated and threaten to declare war on another empire. It‘s almost as if Ingolfur Armarson (Iceland) is jealous that Hawaii gets a lovely position in the Order of the Rump comic and he doesn‘t. Ah, modern day politics…
    In other news, the garbage patch appears to have left town, leaving only their carriers. It was rumored at one point the lackluster war between Mexico and Australia was entirely due to the garbage patch halting movement, but it appears the patch of units have drastically been reduced, which should both be a troubling indicator of Australia‘s long range naval performance and an indicator of future Pacific war performance. We here at the cylinder wait and see how Henry Parkes can project himself across the Indian and Pacific ocean. We wait Henry. We wait.

    this time around, surrounded by all sides by nuclear wasteland. The amount of

  narration: Iceland is finally doing a thing! After the OCP‘s failure with Iceland
    claiming majority of the coastal capitals for himself, effectively resulting in
    Iceland being one of the first people to have won a war with the Boer‘s, we‘ve
    been waiting to his next conquest. His eyes, like Brazil, have shifted to the
    color of orange as he seeks out the blood of his former companion. His empire
    was previously highlighted as possessing a good mix of naval units and a medium
    assortment of melee units meaning that majority of his wars will be won over water.
    Thankfully to Ingolfur (Iceland), the Buccaneer possess almost all of his land
    on water, meaning that a skilled invasion using the bonus movement from the Great
    Lighthouse could result in all of the cross Atlantic Buccaneer holding will be
    switching to a slightly lighter in the coming parts. This is the moment that many
    Iceland fans (myself secretly included) have been waiting for. Tonight we drink!

    of Portobello, it‘ll take a masterful use of what limited resources to avoid an
    eventual capture. Just north we can see some Advanced Destroyers aiming to take
    and claim what is rightfully theirs. The blood will be in the water tonight. I‘m
    almost positively certain. I think I am at least. Right?

  narration: The unique thing about Icelands position is that they have rightful claim
    to all the same land the Buccaneers have. The majority naval focus of their military
    leads to counteract exactly what the beaten and bloody landlubbin‘ pirates stand
    for. A success here with all the Advanced destroyers could spell trouble for the
    potential unification of Inuit America. Hurry up Inuit before they beat you to
    it! I dare you, I double ice-dog dare you

  narration: In the harsh wasteland that is the Icelandic north, a new unit comes
    from his slumber, with an ability to launch many tiles into land and cause havoc.
    This might not mean much for the coastal Buccaneers, but should the Inuit come
    knocking there way, this unit should be able to provide a hearty challenge to
    the wide open plains of North America.

    close in on Veracruz, encuring that it‘ll be a long time coming before Mexico
    can claim the heart of America again. It seems that the days of a wide reaching
    Mexico are over and the tight confines of being stuck between Mexico and Inuit
    are over for the Blackfoot. Now to just clean all this ugly orange fog…

  narration: The war appears to be stagnating despite all the war declarations. More
    melee units keep on emerging from outside of the harbors of many Buccaneer cities,
    indicating that even while beaten by many neighbors and pushed to the very end,
    they will keep on fighting. There‘s always a little bit to love for the Buccaneers,
    even as they fought against the Boer‘s, Inuit, Australia and now Iceland within
    a mere dozen parts. The tenaciousness of this captain knows no bounds.

  narration: Knowing that he‘s actually managed to isolate the curse that‘s been afflicting
    him, Henry Morgan (Buccaneers) orders all of his falsely produced carriers to
    the ocean to act as body guards. Isolating his useless carriers away from his
    more useful Cybersubs and Arsenal ships that defend the Mexican shores. Sure,
    there might be a few workers and submarine‘s in the isolated patch of units, but
    it‘s the thought that counts.

  narration: And the concern is rising, with the sheer amount of hovertanks even stretching
    to bottom most shores, it‘s pretty evident that even advances in technology does
    not avoid the curse of producing many units that cannot effectively take cities.
    If his hope is defense with raw among of damage, then his army might be fit for
    the task, but remember he was the one aiming to take Boer cities, not defend from
    Boer attacking his coastline. If he aims to be competitive against the Boer‘s
    and actually harass the Madagascar cities, he needs to move and fast.

    our omnipotent overseer opts to highlight how Nishapur is in resistance for 3
    turns, which upon being out of resistance can positively contribute to the war
    effort. If it hasn‘t build defensive buildings, securing those on these cities
    might allow it to be even more of a choke-point for the Sibir army to waste away
    to. If I can judge the relative emptiness of Siberian lands, it‘ll only take a
    few more turns of grinding away before Vietnam can unleash it‘s army entirely
    on the Siberian core. Sibir needs to produce as many units as possible, as fast
    as possible should it wish to withstand the meat-grinder that is combat against
    Vietnam.

    but the complete and total lack of any melee units makes that quite a tough task.
    If this was Civilization VI, the Buccaneers might be in a far better place with

    All the war and excitement going on, we‘ve practically neglected the war that brought the Iberian peninsula into question. The war between the Buccaneers and the Finnish was what allows the expansion of the Boer into the Iberian peninsula and allowed even more expansion into the world. Now that they‘ve pretty much said “My bad bro.” to each other, they go off on their own, promising to never speak of this mistake again.
    In other words, nothing much has changed in this part aside from slightly more Power Infantry scattered in the Swedish core, which‘ll amount to nothing at the rate that this empire is using them. Which is never. Because they‘re not at war. Ever.

    statistic to an empire. In other not sarcastic news, I‘m happy to see the amount
    of Giant Death Robot‘s walking alongside other melee units, confirming my belief
    that Vietnam was intending to fill their army with more melee units but lacked
    the actual space to produce them. The convenient meat grinder that is Sibir to

    with Lisbon and Cienfuegos perfectly in Buccaneer control long enough that the
    latter isn‘t being puppeted, meaning it can participate in producing any melee

    was positioned in just a way that it couldn‘t be accosted from naval means. Thus,
    the two naval empires decided in a nuclear blaze of glory that it wasn‘t worth

    far and wide, insuring the utter destruction of the defenses and that the city
    is theirs. However, they‘ve done this to the Boer‘s, a mechanical beast unmoving
    and unflinching, willing to do whatever it needs to and whatever it takes to sink

I warned you about a prolonged war with Vietnam bro. I warned you!

Should it get defended with a… nevermind, I don‘t think they care about the defensive improvement that a citadel gets and only views it for the little bits of land score they get upon stealing someone‘s land.

    what allowed the Buccaneers to easily accost the Inca early on in the game and
    easily granted them strategic advantage over any American warfront. Regaining
    this strategic canal might not give them as much advantage as it once did, it‘ll
    at least take that advantage away from the war weary Australian navy, whom offensive

    to own. That made me sad, so I changed my grin to a slight smirk. I doubt that
    this city capture, should it happen will last long as melee units are nearby and
    prepared to take the city for what it is. It also appears that Punchal was taken

  narration: Henry Parkes (Australia) notices the nuclear arsenal ship and has decided
    to one up him by not only bringing on ship, but many. This amount of ships leaving
    and going towards Paul Kruger (Boer) lands is quite positive for anyone supporting
    Australia, as they garbage patch aiming for Mexico  and Boer should roughly reach
    landfall at the same time. But let‘s not get ahead of ourselves, because they
    have to actually make it to landfall through the bombing and air raids on both
    ends to actually do that. Should he succeed and make landfall and claim at least
    one Boer city, it‘ll be the first time Paul Kruger‘s inner holdings have received
    any form of competition since the dawn of the Orange Containment Project a dozen
    or so parts ago. God speed, you magnificent Australian, god speed.

  narration: Impressed by the suicide move that Kekkonen (Finland) has performed on
    the Boer‘s much similar to his own suicide move against Iceland many parts ago,
    good ol‘ Napolean lifts his glass and offers a toast, wishing secretly that the
    Dvinese military would defend him in case of nuclear irradiation. The Dvinese
    Empire merely shrugs and awaits the destruction across the Nile.

  narration: The grinding occurs slowly, but surely as Lisbon shows signs of flipping
    meanwhile Marrakech tries to fight off the weaker but still far more annoying
    Marine‘s who begin to accost the former Moroccan capital. Sadly enough with the
    positioning of Icelandic units, Marrakech might actually fall before Lisbon, which
    is a troubling sign considering how easy pickings these coastal cities were for
    the Viking Armada.

  narration: In a tactical espionage action moment, an Icelandic worker works alongside
    Buccaneer brethren, hoping that he‘ll be able to blend in. Unfortunately for the
    unit, everyone can tell that he doesn‘t belong here. Irregardless of that, it‘s
    amazing that the first Icelandic unit pictured to make landfall in Buccaneer land
    after the war declaration appears to be a worker. Truly a hero.

  narration: Finally, we see actual contact of Australian units approaching orange
    shores with more than enough nuclear missles to awaken every Madagascar unit from
    their slumber. In front of them lies the most dangerous navy the world has crafted.
    Empty carriers. The Australians thankfully have brought just the weapon to deal
    with the flotilla menace!

    in various directions, hopefully towards orange shores to the east, but we may
    never know.

  narration: I was hoping I would be able to narrate an elimination, but it seems
    that the Blackfoot decided to stand about and rub their head instead of taking
    two key cities. The good part is that with the paratroopers all breathing down
    the neck of each and every city, it wouldn‘t take much more than a swift breeze
    for Mexico to be the next voted off of Surviv-… Civilization Battle Royale. And
    by votes I mean murdered. Badly.

  narration: Meanwhile, in paradise, there is an amazing lack of units. If Korea doesn‘t
    bulk up, Vietnam could point their guns towards the empire that decided that Tibet
    was a plaything and declared war on it. If the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) are anything,
    they‘re spiteful. Thankfully, the lovely scenery featuring way too many citadels
    makes this an obvious tourist location for everyone to visit if anything. They
    just hope their next visitor doesn‘t bring Giant Death Robots and way too many
    Drove AV‘s.

  narration: Hey, Trungs. I told you not to nuke random cities you have no chance
    of actually damaging yourself! Come on now, or I‘ll take away your fancy new unit.
    Like come on, it‘s rude to all the workers who just want a place to relax. Thankfully,
    the Knights of the Maound Table have taken the high road away from any nuclear
    blasts, grouped up in two for added protection in the surprisingly dangerous Siberian
    tundra.

  narration: It appears that the aggression has halted at Carrollton, which is good
    for anyone who wishes Sibir to be able to make it out of this. Unfortunately,
    it appears that Power Infantry appear to be knocking on the door and they have
    an unfortunate message for any Roman Ballista caught in the way. Wait?! The Roman
    Ballista?! Peace treaty now. We don‘t want our original refugee to be caught in
    the middle of any nuclear blasts, now do we?

  narration: Despite the complete and total annexation of Iberia at the hand of the
    Boer‘s, the only unit left near the former Buccaneer and shortly Finnish lands
    is a single cybersub trying his damndest to get home, no matter the coast. The
    only thing blocking him is Icelandic tiles that seem to not allow passage, meaning
    he‘d had to force his way past a hovertank to get through to Arretium. I‘ve already
    discussed with /u/TPangolin and we‘ve already worked out the movie rights. “Finnish
    Line From The Mechanic Menace” coming to theater square districts near you!

  narration: Lisbon falls! Lisbon falls! With the final eradication of most easy experience
    to be gained from the ships nearby, they focus their attention on the Portuguese
    capital, quickly scooping it up in mere moments forcing the Buccaneers to make
    a last assault onto Marrakech. Thankfully to your budding film makers, these movie
    rights are still available! Go ahead and post as much art of this final Marine
    defense in /r/civbattleroyale/ subreddit immediately before it gets copyrighted
    by Warner Brothers. Act now!

  narration: D-D-Double kill! Impressed by the destruction of Tikal across the globe,
    the Boer decide to try the same thing to a nearby Finnish city of Trebizond, erasing
    it off the map, leaving the beautiful perfume in it‘s place to make sure the ruins
    don‘t upset the naturally radioactive odor around this part of the world. How
    considerate of the Boers!

  narration: Now we‘ll be covering the cities you never know what was in them. In
    the makeshift capital of Kaneohe is a unique building called the Heiau that provides
    two faith and a random specialist slot at the cost of two maintenance, no double
    aiding in the relatively low amount of land in this city. The land, unfortunately,
    doesn‘t seem to be well fed with most tiles only bringing two food yield and not
    much more to the city, meaning it has less production and food than the nuclear
    radiated Port Royale at the beginning of this part!

  narration: Speaking of no yields, we have the starving capital of Beryozovo where
    our lovely spy is surviving by stealing as much food from the local granary. Our
    lovely overseer has highlighted a Great Work depicting Paris, which when located
    in the harshest Siberian north, seems to be a beautiful taste of irony. Elsewise,
    this city doesn‘t appear to be doing so hot with only 12 production to it‘s name.

  narration: The Mongolian capital of Karakorum appears to be doing beautifully when
    it comes to production, being able to put a lot of production into the Science
    production queue, allowing Mongolia to focus on climing ever higher into the scientific
    ladder. This is made easier by the lovely book of Huckleberry Finn located in
    the local University, offering a fine read for any training helicopter gunship
    pilot.

  narration: The makeshift capital of Yerevan (Armenia) seems like an inferior version
    of Karakorum (Mongolia) in all stats, both stagnating in population but at a lower
    number, meaning these stats aren‘t likely to be improving any time soon. Highlighted
    is a unique building that converts 20% of the population each turn to the first
    World Religion each and every turn, also allowing it to produce an additional
    two faith for being adjacent to a mountain tile.

  narration: With this, this ends one of the longest parts in CBR history. I hope
    my relatively speedy narration was enough to cut it. This has been a blast, and
    on behalf of everyone in the Civilization Battle Royale community and myself,
    /u/LunarNeedle, I wish you a beautiful border gore filled day. May all your wars
    be irrelevant, and your plots numerous.
