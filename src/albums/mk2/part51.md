  narration: Welcome to part 51 of the Civilization Battle Royale! I am /u/RoastNonsense
    and I have the honor of narrating this week. The first 50 parts have taken us
    from 61 civilizations down to 34, and the party shows no signs of stopping.

  narration: The power rankers have again completed their work and the Boers are still
    on top, as they repeatedly unveil new units from the Future Worlds mod, not to
    mention introducing Mr. Giant Death Robot and his growing number of twin brothers.

  narration: We start this week with a view of the eastern Mediterranean, where the
    Spartans have a thorough if outdated naval carpet. Sparta’s army has reached the
    shadow of the walls of Jerusalem after last part’s citadel spam, and Armenia has
    only riflemen tech and fewer combat units than non-combat units on screen. If
    the Leonidas feels good after leg day, he may well charge east soon.

  narration: In the eastern Indian Ocean, the war between Sri Lanka and the Kimberley
    has started with Simhapura and Denpasar both being bombarded and the two sides
    clashing with large numbers of destroyers. While both sides have ranged naval
    units, they apparently aren’t at this particular party and the fate of cities
    will be decided not through combined arms but by getting up close and personal.

  narration: Since we’ve last seen Sub-Saharan Africa, the Buccaneers have lost Yeji
    but taken Bamako, which held the lion’s share of the Malian air force. Mansa Musa
    should be able to retake the city soon, but half his empire glows in the dark.
    Remember that it was Mali back in part 48 that started the avalanche of declarations
    of war on Buccs, and a scarcity of Bucc infantry could be the sole reason Mansa
    Musa lives to regret it.

  narration: |-
    Simhapura has been flipped down to 1 pop after hard fighting and now lies well behind the Kimberley destroyer line. The Kimberley haven’t been at all proactive this game, but they did fight very well for a while against Australia. The question is whether Sri Lankan carriers just off the subcontinent will bring a repeat of what happened the last time Jandamarra (Kimberley) got in a fight.
    In a fine show that there are no grudges being held, the Kimberley capital Makassar is thoroughly protected by Aussie troops.

  narration: Ingolfur Arnarson has completed what Te Rauparaha could not as the Sydney
    (Memorial) Opera House is completed in scenic Reykjavik. Iceland’s greatest musician
    has written the sordid tale of the Maori’s terrible fall from trying to build
    a cultural wonder to unleashing the nuclear genie from its bottle with the sack
    of Sydney. For tonight’s opening gala both a great admiral and what surely has
    to be a ceremonial unit of knights are queued nearby, as this promises to be hottest
    ticket in all of Iceland.

  narration: |-
    Henry Parkes has taken a  more sanguine approach to the tragedy, opting to develop nuclear weapons himself for a policy of mutant third eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
    While Australia has a considerable number of Diggers, remember that the nickname diggers was bestowed on ANZAC troops for their actions at Gallipoli in the Great War, and that this UU is falling ever further behind the Future Worlds units we see in other parts of the world. The cool hats aren’t enough to scare the world any more, Henry, you need powered armor, or at least the helmet icons of infantry.

  narration: Mali is back to controlling all their territory, and their gatling guns
    sit and wait in an uneasy calm. The one unit of infantry south of Tombouctu is
    a very small start to building a modern army, but with the western Malian empire
    still shrouded in smoke and fallout, Mansa Musa’s people probably just want to
    go back to the quiet life they had before SOPA fever struck. Fighting piracy seemed
    important, but maybe this was a hint that a different approach would have been
    less ruinous.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene12.jpg
  narration: The Kimberley have Simhapura firmly in hand and Sri Lanka’s destroyer
    line has been pushed back further. Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka) seems intent on keeping
    a strong home fleet tight around the capital of Colombo rather than reinforcing
    the destroyer flotilla that’s engaged and faltering. Twelve aircraft on carriers
    could make a big difference, but they are calming the populace rather than helping
    at the front line.

  narration: Tulum has a fair sized portion of the Wollongong Armada around it, and
    Morgan decides the best move is to embark a great many ground troops with nearly
    no naval escorts. The Australian sub commanders must be licking their chops at
    all the troopships that they’re about to send to the bottom. Still, with 19 aircraft
    in Huamanga and Vilcas, bombing runs have brought the city to deep red and an
    amphibious assault might flip the city.

  narration: |-
    The Sibir-Yakutia war remains a stalemate and Finnish and Boer peacekeepers have eliminated even the small naval conflict that once existed in the one-tile channel. Now it’s only an endless stream of Yakut bombing runs and defiant Sibirian citizens shaking their fists amongst the rubble.
    It’s for the best really, as Yakutia has only a handful of mechanized infantry and tanks, and most of their people in the west are holding shovels instead of firearms. The citizens of Tomtor perhaps gaze longingly at the Boer power armor infantry nearby and dream of a time when Yakutia held the position the Boers held now…
    As a side note, Mongolia is starting to build up an air force to go with their carpet, and the Mongol-Yakut border is the one place the peacekeepers have gaps.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene15.jpg
  narration: A destroyer flips Bamako back to Buccaneer hands, and Yeji is dropped
    to zero from bombardment. In the classic tale of navy vs. army, the Buccaneers
    can ruin a great many things but won’t take much territory, while Mali can only
    try to roll with the punches and flip cities back.
- scene_number: "16"

  narration: Henry Morgan has sailed a landship into the Pacific in front of the enemy
    fleet and recaptured Tulum for the moment. Between Aussie planes and privateers
    it’ll flip back, but with Nassau in the frame, we can see that the Buccs have
    profound air superiority and the city may do its best Bilma impression if the
    two landships near Vilcas can somehow make the crazy run their buddy did.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene17.jpg
  narration: An advanced Inuit fleet has found a very unlucky Kimberley artillery
    battery, and this may be the most action that come from the Inuit declaring war
    on Jandamarra. If there were just an Inuit privateer, this slide would have the
    complete collection from caravel up to the limit of Inuit technology.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene18.jpg
  narration: |-
    Sri Lankan air strikes are hitting Simhapura and Denpasar but the destroyer clash is now nearly at the border. Kimberley has finally brought in subs to fire from behind their destroyer screen, and the AI’s tendency to have planes go for cities rather than units may cost Sri Lanka dearly in this case.
    Vietnam has done a fine job in filling up the territory of its recent Champa conquests, including an air force to match anyone nearby. If the Trung sisters decide to pick a fight, they are ready to go again.
    On a personal note, I’m now much more hopeful for my Kimberley stocks in the Battle Royale Stock Exchange at /r/BRSE, where you can buy and sell shares to predict the future of the game in financial style.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene19.jpg
  narration: |-
    Kandahar is back in Afghan hands as Vietnamese troops work on two of the most hard to reach cities in the world. There are only two tiles that allow access to Lahor, but they’re covered by Mongolian troops, and while Vietnam has troops at the gates of Khost, they aren’t getting any artillery or air support. It seems likely the advance will stall out here unless the indirect fire support changes priorities.
    Meanwhile, Finland has finished installing wall-to-wall carpeting in the old Mughal cities, and are spilling into both Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. If they put this kind of focus into Batticaloa on the Arabian penninsula, Kekkonen could probably take a sizeable bite out of the middle east. If.

  narration: Pliny has travelled the world and seen all the wonderful things, and
    lo, Paul Kruger is at the top of the list. I expect he’ll stay first and increase
    his lead given how the Boers are grabbing all the Future Worlds wonders as soon
    as they pop up. Afghanistan was the leader in wonders in the Mk. I battle royale,
    but they’ll more likely have a funeral than any more wonder unveilings.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene21.jpg
  narration: Fully 19 civilizations have a wonder at present, more than half of the
    civs in the world. At this point in a domination game many of the older wonders
    have lost their luster, and Finland having the Statue of Liberty is worth a lot
    more going forward than say, Terracotta Army and the Oracle.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene22.jpg
  narration: Mali has finally settled with the Buccs after starting the ball rolling
    on SOPA, and the final cost is four cities on top of the millions of dead. Those
    sensitive to border gore may wish to avert their eyes as there’s not only the
    Gao enclave but also three tiles floating by themselves, disconnected from any
    city. I’m really rather impressed by the terms of the deal given how little the
    Buccaneers tried to take any cities, but I assume getting nuked to glass by a
    vastly superior power and having most of your co-belligerents back out weighs
    heavily on one’s mind.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene23.jpg
  narration: Mansa Musa of Mali, fresh from the ending of the last chain of DoW’s
    he started, teams up with Chile to go to war with a much weaker target in Kamehameha.
    The world has gotten small enough that very few declarations of war don’t lead
    to bloodshed. That poor Chilean privateer between Hilo and Kailua-Kona is not
    long for this world, and if other civs decide to join the party, Hawai’i may not
    last.

  narration: As we check in with our spies, we see Parakramabahu plotting against
    Arabia, but it’s doubtful they can spare the strength given how they’re getting
    pushed back by the Kimberley and Arabia has infantry, unlike its neighbors. No
    earth-shaking surprises this edition.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene25.jpg
  narration: |-
    Vietnam continues to throw itself down tiny corridors and into walls as far as Afghanistan is concerned, with no artillery support for Khost and Lahor having four peacekeepers running interference. The paratrooper assault on Kandahar has relented, and the Finnish blob is threatening to spread to where Vietnam may get blocked out from further progress to the west.
    Please take a moment now to relax and contemplate the unit carpet of Tibet, with great musicians playing harmonies on the mountainsides. There is no war in Lhasa. There is no war in Lhasa.

  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene26.jpg
  narration: Off to Europe now, where Sweden has developed the tech for communications
    arrays in stark contrast to the fact that most of their army still seems to be
    on horseback wearing neat hats. The Swedes also have a stark contrast in neighbors,
    where France is far behind the curve and Sparta is still a potential target, yet
    on the other hand, Iceland and Finland each have the capability to overwhelm Swedish
    defenses. If Iceland and Finland bordered each other then Gustavus Adolfus might
    team up with one against the other but Sweden is very constrained and perhaps
    even trapped when it comes to diplomacy.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene27.jpg
  narration: |-
    Australia and the Buccaneers have made peace, with a net change of just Tulum. We can see how empty the Buccaneer portion of South America is, probably a significant factor in deciding to be done with a power as large as Oz. Also, the overwhelming air superiority the Buccs held is now down to 4 planes in Huamanga. Where they all went to, I do not know. While I’m impressed that the Buccs did this well after so many DoW’s, the loss of Tulum is the first time an enemy has advanced to gain a strategic base at Bucc expense.
    In the southwest corner the Chilean fleet is headed off to their war with Hawai’i, saying “Pardon me” while slipping through the gap in the Wollongong Armada.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene28.jpg
  narration: |-
    The Hawai’i DoW chain gets a new link as the Blackfoot join in. While they haven’t done much on land, the Blackfoot have had a surprising Pacific presence, with island cities in the Aleutian chain and their sniped city of Olangapo from when Oz and Vietnam were fighting. Their navy has a lot of sails for this point of the game, but Hawaii doesn’t have subs deployed and this Blackfoot fleet may be able to push hard.
    Note also the utterly terrifying naval carpet the Inuit are building up, and similarly the Sioux have built up to having fully four military units at once.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene29.jpg
  narration: |-
    Here in the east Atlantic, a Buccaneer flotilla including an advanced destroyer has had to consult the relationship graphic by /u/mazerlaser to discover just which of all these ships they’re supposed to be shooting at. Henry Morgan (Buccs) is in fact at war with Persia, so those privateers are in quite a lot of trouble.
    On a personal note, I am very glad that some day when Chile and the Buccs go to war, it will almost certainly be some other narrator who has to tell their naval forces apart. (Please, oh please, don’t let that DoW be on the next slide. PLEASE.)

  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene30.jpg
  narration: Okay, NOW we’re getting some good stuff from our spies.Ishtar will earn
    an Intelligence Star for this one, as Yakutia vs. Mongolia could be a very consequential
    war. Yakutia has only a small number of troops, especially on the west, and Mongolia
    has enough artillery to deal with all the mountains. The problem is that peacekeepers
    keep coming in, and while it’d be hard for the Mongol horde to get in it’d also
    be extremely hard for the Yaks to take anything back. That being said, what on
    earth is Trigger Darkhan thinking in being inclined to start such a war, without
    units and without space to move them? Maybe the cold has finally gotten to his
    brain.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene31.jpg
  narration: The World Congress has met and Chile has not found their favor, getting
    embargoed. Chile has been pouring its resources into its navy since the war with
    Brazil, and all those escuadras nacionales and subs could mean big trouble for
    Hawai’i if they head northwest. This could be Bernardo’s big break in terms of
    making a major expansion and rising above just fighting Brazil every once in a
    while for minor results.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene32.jpg
  narration: The other World Congress proposal banned gold, which must be a bit annoying
    to Henry Parkes as he has two mines right by Melbourne. The Aussie carpet of Diggers
    isn’t aging well, and there’s a caravel at the right side of the screen. Having
    a huge lead in number of cities looks like it’s very costly for their effective
    science production, and there don’t seem to be destroyers amongst the carriers,
    battleships, and subs.

  narration: |-
    The Inuit are yet farther into the Future Worlds techs, and now have generators adding 4 gold to the output of snow tiles, a big boon for the White Walker economy. With the discovery of Nanomaterials the generator also gains +2 production, cranking these snow tiles up even farther.
    Note that while there are very few land units, the naval carpet is very formidable.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene34.jpg
  narration: Texas is probably the best positioned city-state in the game at present,
    with a decent number of units and a noticeable lack of any ominous border build-ups.
    The Inuit have just a few garrisons in the American Midwest, Mexico could definitely
    be held off with the Texan UA boosting defence near the capital, and Canada has
    long since given up on attacking Austin. If you want a quiet spot for a vacation,
    Austin might fit the bill for a while.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene35.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka joins Yakutia in declaring war on Texas. Ambitious, given that
    Parakramabahu has been pushed even further away from  Austin and the Kimberley.
    Simhapura is again extremely low after air strikes, but no Sri Lankan destroyer
    looks able to break through the pell-mell battle and take the city. The Sri Lankans
    have 24 aircraft in the theater compared to a big zero for the Kimberley and this
    air force is just not producing significant results in terms of repulsing the
    Kimberley advance. Declaring war on Jandamarra (Kimberley) without overwhelming
    superiority looks like it’s a bad idea.

  narration: Arabia has finally reached the top step and joined the information age,
    leaving some of its neighbors behind. With mechanized infantry and bazookas starting
    to roll out, Harun al-Rashid could become very threatening if he shells out the
    money to upgrade his great war infantry two steps. Persia still has pikemen manning
    the frontier, and Arabian troops could collapse onto Baghdad and have a very short
    border to defend afterward. You can do it, Harun! I believe in you!

  narration: A drone UAV says good morning to the Giant Death Robot outside Atebubu.
    Drone UAV’s are flying ranged units with 100 ranged power and the ability to move
    after attacking. They also have no resource cost, so be prepared to make friends
    with quite a lot of them. Mr. Giant Death Robot will still be my friend, though.

  narration: Another future worlds first is this hypervelocity missle, where you put
    in 200 hammers and get out 120 combat power of single use explosion. It also has
    evasion 100, so don’t worry about those pesky Mobile SAMs giving you any trouble.
    The Boer carpet includes increasing amounts of power armor infantry, drone fighters,
    and what I can only assume are Society for Creative Anachronism caravels off of
    Bahir Dar.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene39.jpg
  narration: North Africa is fairly empty for people for people not named Morocco.
    Ethiopia has pulled its forces back and Mali still needs to clean up fall out
    from the atomic bombing. Nyeni, at 8 population may be the smallest capital in
    the game. Sparta’s naval carpet could easily grab Ethiopian coastal cities, and
    despite Morocco having a fair number of units, the Buccaneer navy would win on
    tech easily. The North African nations need to hope for time to benefit from what
    was once Carthaginian territory, and the Boers or Sparta need only reach out their
    hand and take.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene40.jpg
  narration: Chile and Hawai’i are skirming off the coast of Baja, and Hawai’i’s lack
    of submarines will cost them dearly the longer the war goes on. Mexican sailors
    look on amused to see obsolete units fight for their amusement, as in the days
    of old when the Roman coliseum was flooded for mock naval battles. (No, seriously,
    that actually did that.)

  narration: |-
    Wulungarra has fallen into Sri Lankan hands on a forgotten front far from either civilization’s homeland. A few destroyers probably won’t be able to take either of the other Kimberley ice cities, but for civs the size of these two, a 9 pop city is nothing to sneeze at.
    Elsewhere on this slide, Sibir scouts hope to one day complete their treasure hunt so they can freeze in the north instead.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part51-scene42.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka’s resistance has collapsed, and the Kimberley destroyer line
    is free to fall upon the target of its choice. With battleships finally coming
    to the front, the Jandamarra’s navy can pick a target and shell it into oblivion
    in fairly short order. The AI for Sri Lanka has not been nearly effective enough
    against the Dreamtime Destroyer Swarm, and their capital may start flipping because
    of it. Simhapura has been bombed to near zero and it profits Parakramabahu (Sri
    Lanka) nothing.

  narration: |-
    A look now at Persia, for all you Persia fans out there: multiple pikemen on the front lines, a scattering of artillery, no aircraft, and no, that’s not a Persian infantry near Persepolis, he’s Sri Lankan and just visiting.
    A few parts ago in the poll /u/unklphil runs (Highly recommended! Please vote!) I threw up my hands in despair and started voting for Finland to take over the Middle East. Yes, they only have one city, but honestly who else is going to do it? Arabia is finally starting to look decent, but they are all of them on borrowed time.

  narration: Vietnam continues to only bombard Lahor while only having troops next
    to Khost. Afghan troops have advanced toward Peshawar, but it’s doubtful they’ll
    be able to go any further. This war is going to be slowly frozen in place as the
    Trung Sisters (Vietnam) don’t bombard the city they’re actually next to and Finnish
    peacekeepers slowly choke all the open space away from Afghanistan.

  narration: The citadel highlighted is not new, it’s been there since at least part
    49, but it puts a huge crimp in Vietnam’s ability to prosecute the war. An open
    border treaty would with Sibir would at least create the possibility get multiple
    units involved, but Kuchum Khan (Sibir) seems happy to have his infantry just
    watch for instructional purposes. Vietnam has mechanized infantry now, but it
    needs space to get to melee range, and that space simply doesn’t exist.

  narration: The Wobbegong Armada is having a huge gathering at their newest naval
    base of Tulum, and surely some of them are frustrated to see how empty Buccaneer
    territory is, wondering if there might have been so much more available if they
    had been able to press the conflict harder. Even if Henry Parkes gave in to absolute
    bloodlust, Australia is bound to at least 10 turns without fighting. The war is
    over, and things are so very quiet, but both sides would do well to prepare for
    the next wave of conflict.

    +33% culture for all 49 cities, the Boers will get a notable boost to effective
    science and their social policies. Anything that scales with the size of the empire
    is valuable on a map this big, and while there are certainly Future Worlds wonders

    between Modern Armor and Giant Death Robots. They require aluminum and have a
    combat power of 120, which, by the by, is greater than the defense value of any
    city in this slide, although Kangiqtiniq is close at 114. The Ice Sheet Fleet,
    while largely tucked out of the way by the Arctic ice cap, is large enough to
    wreak utter mayhem if it could just get into position and Ekeuhnick said go.

    ring of Vietnamese peacekeepers, and there’s even an extremely optimistic/deluded
    Inuit settler who would try to put a replacement city in the world’s only available
    spot, where in summer the sun never sets, and in winter the mountains glow in
    the dark.  Strangely enough, the two civilizations that actually control the territory
    in this slide hardly  have more units in total than the various paratroopers and
    visitors just passing through. Aussies, Koreans, Mexicans, Vietnamese, and Boers
    all have the chance to see the destruction left behind from a nuclear exchange.

    of lost planes very soon. The Dreamtime Destroyer Swarm is almost within sight
    of the Parakramabahu’s palace in Colombo, and after all this naval combat, there’s
    finally a great admiral joining up with the Kimberley fleet. Nothing is certain
    yet, but Jandamarra (Kimberley) may have been sleeping bear that would have been
    better left undisturbed.

    In the top right of the slide you can see one of the Blackfoot’s Aleutian Island cities, which are a significant chunk of population thanks to the Deity AI bonuses. Headed south from same is a moderate sized fleet of sail era ships eating a light breakfast of Hawai’ian privateers before heading south to the main island chain. The three trade ships offer the promise of the fine brunch, to boot.

    from the north to complete a pincer move with the combined Blackfoot/Chilean fleets
    coming up from the southeast. Kamehameha has to be a bit worried that his fleets
    won’t hold, and as small as the islands are, there isn’t room for many melee units
    to retake cities if they fall. \nZooming out just a bit, the Mexican navy could
    clean up rather nicely if they declare war after the main belligerents exhaust
    their forces. Mexico doesn’t have much history of opportunistic war, but steel
    ships would have an easy time going through the last few Hawai’ian privateers…"

    the Blackfoot have assembled a very respectable carpet of units and are overflowing
    slightly into Inuit and Sioux territory. This augurs well for their war with Kamehameha
    (Hawai’i) since there is nothing to distract from their focus. \nAlso note the
    increasing presence of Inuit power armor infantry. The production focus seems
    to be ships for the navy, but a few unit of power armor are likely enough to hold
    a while against the units of any of their neighbors."

    number of Boer paratroopers have vanished before our eyes, just like when Sweden
    ended its open borders treaty with Paul Kruger. It becomes exceedingly clear how
    little Trigger Darkhan has, with a tank corps that can’t go through a mountain
    range, and a bare handful of mech infantry units to patrol the border with the
    Mongol Horde. If anybody tipped Ghengis to Yakutia’s plotting, it could be very
    painful very quickly.

    an AI domination match with the relationship penalty from differing ideology,

    and wide, as all Finnish territory is covered, as well as the westernmost bits
    of Sibir territory. Paratroopers are nice, but there are scattered great war infantry
    and no regular infantry in the homeland, nor are there any Finnish airplanes in
    this slide. You’re scary Mr. Kekkonen, but you could be scarier. Also, best of
    luck with repealing that embargo.

  narration: Outside of Gyantse, the last Mughal admiral looks at the sun setting
    over his old home while the evening’s land breeze brings the smells of the still-burning
    fields surrounding the city. They came from the sky on silk flowers, dropping
    to the ground and gunning down the old men and beardless youths who made up the
    final defense of the empire. As an admiral, he had no place in the fighting, and
    for all his skill and guile, he could be of no greater service than to shepherd
    the refugees from the city to wherever the four winds might carry them, to whatever
    shores might offer them succor. The sun’s last smear of red faded from the sky,
    and the admiral was left alone with nothing but a moonless night and a wind carrying
    the ashes of his children’s home. He closed his eyes.

    In this slide, we see the last Ashanti pikemen, who spend their years swimming laps in a three tile long pool. In the mixed-polearms swimming medley in the International Games there’s just no beating the Ashanti teams.

    Kotte and the city is down to half health. Aircraft carriers probably won’t save
    Parakramabahu this time, and the last Sri Lankan destroyers are at low health
    and outnumbered. A spare Kimberley battleship has been detailed to bombard Colombo,
    just to let them know the rest of the navy will be back soon.

    Mongolian cannon battery has been parked there for years. This slide gives a lovely
    view of Afganistan’s unique improvement the Kalle. It gives +1 gold and +1 food,
    with these doubled if next to a mountain. The Afghan UA gives +25% strength when
    next to mountains, so things aren’t looking so good for Vietnamese units on the
    Kandahar front either, though a paratrooper might just survive the drop in to
    flip the city briefly.

  narration: With a nice shot of the Buccaneer core, we can see that they have nice
    population, but not a significant unit carpet. They have helicopter gunships,
    but only landships to train against rather than tanks or modern armor. The Aussie
    fleet at Tulum is a sizable threat, but there are enough ships near the Nassau
    canal that the Buccs could likely hold or retake anything lost. There is definitely
    not enough force to mount any major offensives, so Henry Morgan had best hope
    for a couple of quiet parts to rebuild after the SOPA war. The former Malian cities
    have a long hard road ahead before workers make those cities a productive addition
    to the country.

    The Blackfoot fleet has reached the shores of Honolulu with an upgraded bomber in tow, but there likely isn’t enough to bring down the Hawai’ian capital yet, even if there weren’t Hawai’ian privateers ready to come help. The Blackfoot sub has an all-you-can-eat buffet, so the longer the war goes on, the more free kills it can pile up. An important question for this slide is if there are any Chilean forces just to the south, or if these scattered few Blackfoot ships are all that have arrived.
    Also, please note the mystery trireme by Kahalui. It could only get there by teleportation, since Hawai’i is surrounded by deep water. It can’t be Pirate or Chilean since it would have been destroyed by bombardment. I conclude this must be an American trireme, stranded here for hundreds of years, rowing for generations.

    A press of the F key may be in order, as Dvin no longer has Islam as majority religion. Having been converted as the final act of a wandering great prophet in exile after the fall of the Ayyubid Empire, there will never again be an Islamic city in the world.
    The Spartans are sending a number of great generals toward Dvin and may be about to citadel-bomb their way toward Bethlehem or possibly above Jerusalem, just to annoy Armenia further. Leonidas has an awful lot of empty space in the territory of his neighbors, and the temptation must be enormous. A declaration of war looks to be in the cards sometime soon.

    Honolulu can’t stay at 35 population for long. The Blackfoot carriers are hitting
    Waikiki, bringing it down to below half health, but the Hawai’ians finally have
    a submarine, and likely have the privateers to push the invaders back from being
    able to attack cities anymore.

    Wulungarra, but neither side has the forces to make progress on assaulting a city.
    It’ll probably be a destroyer one way and then the other, and a lonely existence
    at the south end of the world. Reinforcements are unlikely until the main fighting
    near Colombo and Sri J. Kotte are resolved.

  narration: See, like that. Sri J. Kotte is nicely resolved, once the sub north of
    the city is killed. Kimberley subs east of Colombo have likely cleared away the
    aircraft carriers Parakramabahu (Sri Lanka) used to have, and the path is clear
    for Jandamarra to go on to take grander prizes from the Sri Lankan core. With
    subs to keep the battleships safe, it’s a simple matter to fire broadsides of
    16 inch shells and bring a city to its knees.

  narration: Okay, now this is a good reason to avoid declaring war against the Inuit.
    With a missile cruiser patrolling the far parts of the world ready to turn an
    enemy capital to glass, leaders are probably willing to bite their tongues when
    faced with significant insult. The Inuit were however one of the nations to declare
    war on the Kimberley in a previous part, so Jandamarra (Kimberley) had best pray
    that there are peacekeepers or visitors near his cities, or else those nukes might
    start to fly. (The AI is prevented from nuking anything with a neutral 3rd party
    in the blast radius.)

  narration: "As we look at the current Kimberley core, there are sufficient peacekeepers
    to prevent nukes any time soon. Let this be a lesson not to keep grudges against
    civs who declare war on you, as they might have value as inadvertent human shields
    later on. The Kimberley presently have a small naval reserve protecting their
    capital, and so they may negotiate with Sri Lanka due to a lack of reinforements
    to send. \nAirplane count: Vietnam 17, Kimberley 4, Australia 106. Some of those
    could be missiles or atomic bombs, but the Australian oil reserves must be staggering."

  narration: "Honolulu has dropped one to 34 pop, but the combined Chilean/Blackfoot
    forces aren’t in position to threaten any cities. Hawai’i still has reinforcement
    to bring from the northwest, and they may not suffer anything worse than a scare
    once this is all over. Kamehameha is also surely proud of his second captured
    escuadra nacional, all the better to keep the invaders from the beautiful beaches
    of his home. \nA lesson for this part seems to be don’t declare war on somebody
    just because Mali does, as the best anyone has managed in such a war is Australia
    taking Tulum. Don’t take Mansa Musa’s suggestions for lottery numbers, either."

  narration: Hawai’ian and Blackfoot privateers clash as both Vietnamese and Inuk
    great musicians look on. Hawai’i has never had a very concentrated military force,
    but their scattered navy has been sufficient for tying up opposition forces. At
    this point Hawai’i is likely to stay snug in their home island chain until a much
    larger power comes loaded for bear, and honestly I’m not sure who that is at the
    moment. Australia need to get destroyers, the Buccs need to reload, and the Inuit
    haven’t shown any interest to move all their ships from the Arctic to the Pacific..
    If they DO develop such an interest, the advanced destroyers and missile cruisers
    would make short work of Kamehameha (Hawai’i).

    do they have jet fighters in play, they have an atomic bomb for cracking any extra
    hard targets. Khost and Lahor are down to nothing, and a machine gun is all that’s
    keeping Khost from falling. Lahor may last a thousand years though, so long as
    Afghanistan keeps renewing the open border treaties with Mongolia and Tibet. Vietnam
    still can’t conquer anything, but at least they’re now correctly doing the things

Sri Lanka may be weak enough that they don’t pose a major threat to somebody joining in the war, but Persia could probably manage to bungle a war with Sri Lanka and still come out the worse for wear.
    On the map we have civs building strength with the Buccs getting units around their puppeted cities, Mali building up an army, Morocco working toward a naval carpet, even near Kumasi, and then Ethiopia is the odd duck, as they still have very little in their western conquests. The Boers continue their quiet ways, and Mr. Giant Death Robot now has a friend of his own kind next door to talk to.

    hero machine gun has fended of a paratrooper, and Khost stands on zero health
    still. The Finnish peacekeepers won’t let Vietnam use its nuclear bomb even if
    they wanted to, and so this war may stay frozen until someone decides to negotiate
    peace. Given how long the Sibir-Yakut stalemate has continued, this may last a
    very long time.

    Off to Iceland, and clearly the althing has been strongly in favor of naval funding as the seas around Britain are swarmed with battleships, which probably take the majority of Icelandic oil supplies. Iceland’s open border with Sweden, Finland, and Canada support the fan theory that Iceland’s next best target will be France, but Ingolfur is keeping his own counsel and hasn’t announced anything as yet. Ireland and Britain are fairly empty on land, but whose ships would survive to land anyone there?
    Religion map fans will note the border between Europe’s Judaism and North America’s Catholicism is a pair of cold Icelandic cities with few enough neighbors that neither religion will make further progress without the use of missionaries.

    at least, Japan’s one city Osaka has a higher population than all of the Kimberley
    cities combined. As a note, population number scales non-linearly, so one 16 pop

    though it hasn’t really shown in their war with the Kimberley. Korea at number
    3 is the outlier, as Sejong’s UA has given a lot of science, but it desperately
