  narration: |-
    Welcome, comrades! I’m longtime lurker /u/CrucibleOfTraining, and I’m here today to present the latest chapter of the legendary saga that is the Mk II Civ Battle Royale. Though I’ve never created a smidgen of OC in my time on this sub, I’ll do my best to guide ya’ll through the upcoming slides with respect, insight, and grace.
    Wars will be fought, nations will be torn asunder, and stupid peace deals will be made. Without further ado, let’s jump on in.

  narration: Here, we have our gorgeous map by /u/Malssistra, with /u/LacsiraxAriscal
    handling city names and ocean borders. Notable changes include the loss of the
    Finnish indian holdings to Vietnam and Finland’s acquisition of two new exclaves,
    snuggled tightly between Yakutia and Mongolia. Finland also gained the city of
    Adrianople from Sparta, showing how active they were last part.

  narration: "The top-ten power rankings haven’t changed at all since last part. The
    Boers, bolstered by their recent conquests and their Unstoppable Mechanized Army
    of Doom®, sit pretty at spot number 1, while the ever-hungry Australia watches
    jealously from second place. \nAs of right now, the only of these civs to be engaged
    in really meaningful wars are Finland (vs. Sparta) and Australia (vs. Chile).
    Keep an eye on those two moving forward."

  narration: "We start with an image of Japan’s last remaining city, Osaka. It’s got
    a nice, juicy population, but its defense force is badly outdated. I reckon just
    about any nearby power could cut through those privateers like butter. Notably,
    Sejong (Korea) has a carrier loaded with an atomic bomb lurking nearby, but don’t
    expect to see any nukes used against Japan until that Finish paratrooper gets
    out of the way. \nAlso: Vietnam has a metric f***-ton of embarked units chillin
    in the north Pacific. What the Trung Sisters have planned for them, nobody knows."

  narration: The Inuit have done a tremendous job reinforcing their most recent city
    capture. Mililani Mauka was captured a few parts ago from the Blackfoot using
    only a few ships. Now it’s surrounded by an armada of cutting edge naval units,
    including cybersubs, advanced destroyers, and arsenal ships. If the Inuit were
    to declare war on Hawaii, their new fleet could capture the last Hawaiian city
    in seconds. It will also prove useful if Ekeuhnick (Inuit) ever faces off against
    Henry Parkes (Australia).

  narration: 'Sparta continues fighting a tough two-front war against Morocco and
    Finland. Against Morocco, the Spartans actually look to be do doing quite well:
    there isn’t a single Moroccan naval unit in sight, promising safety for the Spartan
    island holdings, and though Morocco will try and flip Carthage with land units
    Sparta has a big enough navy to keep taking it back. Things don’t look nearly
    as rosy on the Finnish front. Sparta almost certainly cannot take/hold Adrianople,
    and it seems likely Finland will make a strong push towards Constantinople. You
    might have a sick eight-pack Leonidas, but all the glistening abs in the world
    won’t make up for you still having great war infantry.'

  narration: In the far reaches of the arctic, two Buccaneer ships cling doggedly
    to life, hiding between the massive Icelandic and Swedish navies. What do you
    think damaged them? My bet is a few roaming Finnish ships. As a side note, check
    out how fast Iceland is filling its navy with arsenal ships.

  narration: |-
    Ethiopia, it seems, is the newest member of the armies-so-big-they-overflow-your-borders club, with significant numbers of paratroopers pouring into Persia. This means the Ethiopians are strong enough to have a chance against the Boers, right? Right?!?
    To the East, Vietnam has Finnish-ed (ha) killing the remaining Finnish troops in India and is now filling the area with units.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene09.jpg
  narration: The Australian fleet of mostly submarines struggles to actually capture
    a Chilean city. Luckily, reinforcements are coming in from the east, bringing
    with them a few melee units. If Australia handles their next attack better they
    could easily still make significant gains against the Chileans. Across the globe,
    Morocco flips Carthage back from Sparta.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene10.jpg
  narration: Not much to say here that I didn’t say a few slides back. Morocco holds
    the 1-population Carthage, but Sparta has the naval presence needed to recapture
    it and will probably do so quite soon. The Finnish front hasn’t changed much.
    Strangely, there are Australian diggers hanging out in Icelandic France. Did they
    dig all the way through the earth and pop out on the opposite side of the globe?
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene11.jpg
  narration: |-
    In the Sioux city of Tazipcho, a young Sioux captain boards his newly-constructed caravel. Proud to explore the world in the name of his country, he speaks to his crew: “At last, the Sioux people shall explore and know the world! Our voyages shall usher in a new age of prosperity and greatness for our civilization!”
    “Nah” says the blockading Inuit navy.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene12.jpg
  narration: Sick gains bro! Looks like Leonidas has been drinking extra protein shakes,
    because the Spartan navy just took back Adrianople from the Finns - pretty impressive,
    all things considering. The city is bound to flip back to Kekkonen (Finland) before
    long, but Sparta’s victory here will still help keep Finland at bay.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene13.jpg
  narration: Afghanistan signs peace treaties to end several irrelevant wars. They
    do have one relevant war, with Persia, but that conflict has stagnated and doesn’t
    look to be going anywhere. Both sides are so weak that mounting any strong offensive
    is impossible.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene14.jpg
  narration: Australia continues its strategy of “surround cities with submarines
    until they’re so scared they surrender.” That fleet of Australian reinforcements
    isn’t in frame and may have broken apart. In other good news for Chilean supporters,
    Bernardo Higgins just made peace with the Inuit. Though the Inuit-Chile conflict
    may seem irrelevant, recall that the the Inuit had already seized Chilean holdings
    in the Pacific. Chile doesn’t need the White Walkers taking anything else, certainly
    not with Australia already on their doorstep.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene15.jpg
  narration: 'Crowfoot (Blackfoot) completes the Manhattan project. At the very least,
    having some nukes would even the field between the Inuit and Blackfoot in the
    event of a conflict. The Inuit lands may look pretty empty in this slide, but
    don’t be fooled: their massive tech advantage would still make them favorites
    against the Blackfoot.'
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene16.jpg
  narration: Well darn, I might have to eat my own words. Persia, despite its weakness,
    has mounted a decent campaign against Afghanistan and looks to have chance to
    capture the Afghan capital. Whether or not Darius (Persia) gains anything out
    of this war depends on his ability to continually put pressure on the Afghan units
    guarding that mountain pass.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene17.jpg
  narration: In the obligatory shot of the Boer core, we see huge stacks of drone
    fighters supporting an already terrifying ground force. Hover tanks skim across
    the sea next to aircraft carriers and, weirdly, caravels. There are a few gaps
    in the land carpet but that’s probably just because of the recent expansion into
    Mali.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene18.jpg
  narration: "The combatants from the recently-ended Asian Khan-flict lick their wounds.
    I know it’s been said before, but there’s some reeeaally serious border gore going
    on in this part of the world. \nTrygyn Darkhan (Yakutia) hatches schemes against
    Mao (China), pissed at him for making it difficult to nuke Sibir by putting peacekeeping
    units in the way."
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene19.jpg
  narration: As you can see from this shot, Armenia’s core is just way too empty.
    The only reason they’re still alive is because they don’t share a large border
    with a top-tier civ. Meanwhile, Sweden has retaken Adrianople from Sparta and
    landed some paratroopers near Varna - a nice distraction, but not enough to take
    the city on their own.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene20.jpg
  narration: Ahmad Al-Mansur (Morocco) is seriously struggling in his war with Leonidas
    (Sparta). Carthage is in Spartan hands, and with a lack of nearby Moroccan melee
    units, it may stay that way. Spartan ships also push West toward Braga (Morocco),
    but the Moroccan air force can probably keep them at bay.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene21.jpg
  narration: |-
    Vietnamese paratroopers sit idly on one of the few places on the globe still capable of founding a valid city. A lonely Inuit settler watches in despair, having been surrounded by other Vietnamese troops for the past couple hundred years. “I just want to put down my flag” the settler cries out. But he can’t.
    In the nearby arctic sea, there are entirely too many embarked land units.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene22.jpg
  narration: The AI really likes to kick an enemy while he’s down, doesn’t it? Nearly
    all the plots that the Babylonian spies are reporting have been against dead or
    dying civs. Seriously, what’s the point in attacking a civ with no cities and
    like two outdated military units?
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene23.jpg
  narration: The spies are sent out to various non-capital cities in the Inuit, Vietnamese,
    and Boer empires. Notice that these are three of the top four civs in the game;
    with luck, we’ll get some tasty intel on their plans.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene24.jpg
  narration: "O shit waddup!!! The Finnish paratrooper corps strikes again, seizing
    Varna from the Spartans! Whether or not they keep the city depends on the number
    of additional troops they can drop in. And IF they do hold on to Varna, it’ll
    be a fantastic staging ground for the assault on Constantinople. \nBut regardless
    of what happens to Varna, Finland is clearly the undisputed king of border gore."
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene25.jpg
  narration: Just a little to the South, Armenia joins the club and declares war on
    Sparta. A surprising move, given how utterly weak Armenia’s army is. With only
    a handful of melee units in their entire army I doubt Armenia will be able to
    take a city out of this war - but it’ll still hurt Sparta by draining away resources.
    Even worse, these mounting DOW’s could encourage a more dangerous neighbor - like
    Sweden or Ethiopia - to declare war.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene26.jpg
  narration: |-
    Damnit Australia. You had probably the largest navy in the world and entered a war against a far weaker nation, but you bungled your invasion of the Chilean mainland time and time again. With this peace treaty, the Chileans have managed to escape their ordeal with all of their mainland cities intact, if a bit low on population. Truly a missed opportunity on the part of Australia.
    Remember kids: Always. Bring. Melee. Units.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene27.jpg
  narration: |-
    Canada has a solid carpet going on here, though it relies far too much on anti-aircraft guns for my liking. Lester B. Pearson (Canada) certainly has a denser carpet than his Inuit neighbors, but the Inuit forces are greater in tech level and likely in total number.
    Canada also joins the dogpile against Sparta.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene28.jpg
  narration: Aaaaaand the Ethiopians declare war on……. Korea. Butter luck next time,
    Haile Selasse! With a carpet as strong as his, Ethiopia could have wiped the floor
    with any of their neighbors (excluding the Boers) if they had only made a smarter
    DOW.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene29.jpg
  narration: "The World Congress embargoes the Buccaneers, but somehow I don’t think
    Henry Morgan will mind. He’ll go on drinking rum and building excessive numbers
    of carriers in comfortable solitude. \nHonestly though, the carrier problem is
    probably the Bucc’s single biggest handicap at this point in the game. Imagine
    how powerful their navy would be if every one of their carriers was an advanced
    destroyer."
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene30.jpg
  narration: The World Congress has also banned coral. The new ruling will affect
    nations like Australia or the Buccs that have lots of island cities, but I really
    don’t think these luxury bans are that damaging to the AI. I mean, at the level
    of a deity AI, taking away one resource that could potentially be used for trade
    just doesn’t do much. In addition to the coral ban, check out the sheer diversity
    of units Australia is showing off in this slide. I see diggers, settlers, a lancer,
    submarines, nuclear submarines, a caravel, privateers and more.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene31.jpg
  narration: The Finnish rule over Varna proved to be short-lived. Spartan troops
    took back the city, and it looks secure unless there’s another big paratrooper
    wave. Sparta is also enjoying success in the South, where it’s easily pushing
    back against Armenia.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene32.jpg
  narration: "Tibet and Japan, two superpowers in this game, have just declared war
    against the even more powerful Sitting Bull (Sioux). Expect a long, protracted,
    and incredibly bloody war.  \n....Or maybe not"
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene33.jpg
  narration: Morocco currently holds Carthage, but at zero health it looks ready to
    flip yet again. Over in Anatolia, Finland has brought in more paratroopers and
    is renewing its attack on Varma (Sparta). Notice that Adrianople is still in Finnish
    hands, but if Sparta were to only bring a naval melee unit they could capture
    it back.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene34.jpg
  narration: Varna, for the second time, has fallen under the rule of Kekkonen (Finland).
    The paratrooper presence is stronger this time, but more flips are still likely.
    Lol @ the random tile of Finnish ocean that somehow is considered part of Varna.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene35.jpg
  narration: Sparta flips Varna yet again. But even though Sparta captured the city,
    this slide is looking good for Finland supporters. Both Constantinople and Trebizond
    (Sparta) have taken serious damage and could flip to Finland soon. Also, enough
    space has been cleared in the area that Finland will be able to land greater numbers
    of paratroopers on each turn.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene36.jpg
  narration: Uh-oh. Word is on the street that Ekeuhnick (Inuit) has nasty plans for
    Sam Houston of Texas. And unlike a lot of our spies’ intelligence reports, this
    one could result in a meaningful war. If the rumors end up true, I shall weep
    for my beloved Texas. Brave as we are, we cannot hold off the vile Inuit for long.
    Though I suppose the ridiculous number of Mexican and Australian peacekeepers
    could help keep us safe.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene37.jpg
  narration: |-
    This bit of intelligence is even more ominous: Kruger (Boers) is plotting against Haile Selassie (Ethiopia). Ethiopia has a great carpet going, and a war between them and the Boers would be a conflict of epic scale. But none can survive against the Orange Menace for long.
    In this slide the Boers also show off their recently acquired Bio Drone, a powerful unit that upgrades from the drone UAV and comes with the ‘march’ upgrade.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene38.jpg
  narration: A splendid shot of the well-developed and well-carpeted Vietnamese core.
    Out of Hoi Ann, our agent reports that the Trung Sisters (Vietnam) mean to act
    against Augustus Caesar (Rome). Because, he’s like, such a threat to them, right?
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene39.jpg
  narration: In central Asia, little has changed. Persia has brought Kabul (Afghanistan)
    down to the red, but they won’t take it unless they get past the single Afghan
    unit guarding the pass. Over to the right, there’s a single Tibetan settler fleeing
    his lands, hoping to establish a sanctuary for his people where the Vietnamese
    can never hurt them.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene40.jpg
  narration: 'The Trung Sisters (Vietnam) continue their habit of plotting against
    dead civs as they make plans against China. “I don’t care if he doesn’t have any
    cities, Mao is practically a god!” sister #1 screams at her advisor. “If we don’t
    kill him now, before he’s amassed full power, he’ll go super saiyan and annihilate
    us all!” Or something like that.'
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene41.jpg
  narration: Mao (China) just can’t catch a break. The Boers, jealous of Mao’s charisma
    and influence, also scheme against him.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene42.jpg
  narration: Canada, backed by Sibir, declares war on the Sioux. It’s an understandable
    move; i’d be pissed too if my enemies kept coming back from the dead. But Lester
    B. Pearson (Canada) will have a tough time getting through all those Inuit and
    Blackfoot units.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene43.jpg
  narration: The World Congress will meet shortly to consider banning seals and wine;
    the seals ban would probably affect the Inuit most. This shot also gives a good
    view of the famous Ice Sheet Fleet, probably the most technologically advanced
    on the globe. Too bad it’s stuck in the arctic and never gets any use ;)
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene44.jpg
  narration: 'The Finland-Sparta war is over, and Constantinople has gone to Finland
    in the peace treaty! Some Finnish supporters may be sad Kekkonnen (Finland) didn’t
    gain more, but continuing the war against Sparta would have been too draining.
    Besides, Constantinople is a fantastic city: it’s a capital, it gives access to
    the Mediterranean, and it’d be a great base of operations for future wars against
    Sparta.'
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene45.jpg
  narration: The deadlock outside Kabul (Afghanistan) continues as before, except
    now Persia has brought its legendary pikeman, a veteran of battles from centuries
    past, to the front. Mirwais Hotak of Afghanistan must be trembling in his boots.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene46.jpg
  narration: The Trung Sisters (Vietnam) plot for the 789th time, now against Persia.
    If such plans come to fruition, they will surely result in the annihilation of
    Darius (Persia) and his empire.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene47.jpg
  narration: |-
    What?! How’d that happen?
    Somehow, Canadian units found a way through peacekeeping forces and put a swift end to Itazipcho, the last Sioux city. Sitting Bull presumably died in the battle. I’d ask ya’ll to press F for respects, but this is what, the third time this has happened? At this point, I’m doubtful if Sitting Bull can be “killed” at all. Bid the Sioux people farewell, just don’t be surprised if that farewell ends up being… temporary.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene48.jpg
  narration: Action has returned to North America! Mexico declares war on its age-old
    enemy the Blackfoot, supported by a symbolic Boer DOW. Things are already looking
    bad for the southernmost Blackfoot city, A’annn, which is currently in the red.
    I would definitely say Mexico is the favorite in this war, as they seem to have
    the overall larger force. But then again, since the nations can only fight on
    two relatively small fronts, things could easily devolve into a stalemate.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene49.jpg
  narration: A single Boer unit sails bravely towards the Blackfoot city of Mililani.
    But more interestingly, notifications tell us that Sparta has flipped Carthage
    and for the first time, flipped Jerusalem!
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene50.jpg
  narration: Though Sparta may have been defeated by the Finns, they’re making great
    strides against Armenia. By capturing Jerusalem, they’ve made up for the capitol
    they just lost and are poised to make additional gains in Armenian lands. Hebron
    (Armenia) is so exposed, it’s practically begging for an attack. Personally, I’d
    love to see a Spartan takeover of Armenia. The Armenians have been lazy as an
    Indonesian for centuries.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene51.jpg
  narration: Sri Lanka declares war on Canada. That’s cool and all, but what really
    grabs my interest on this slide is how easily Vietnam could wipe out Sri Lanka
    if they wanted to. That streak of green troops across northern India is terrifying.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part57-scene52.jpg
  narration: "HYYYYYYYYPE TRAAAAIN!! The Inuit declare war on Canada!! This sensational
    DOW reignites a conflict that’s been dead for centuries. Old wrongs shall be remembered,
    and massive bloodshed is assured as both sides fight for vengeance. It’s a veritable
    grudge match. \nMy money here’s on the Inuit. That Sioux city Canada just captured
    will collapse any second, and I doubt it’ll be the last to fall. Of course, Canada
    is still capable of putting up a good fight. They’ll almost certainly take the
    Inuit exclave in their lands."

  narration: |-
    Things look pretty even numbers-wise so far, but the Inuit have a huge edge in technology. In Hudson Bay there are cybersubs and arsenal ships facing off against vanilla destroyers. That’s not going to end well for Canada. Pearson (Canada) has a reserve force of destroyers to the East, but the Inuit have their own Ice Sheet Fleet stashed up in the North, and it’s far, far scarier.
    The Inuit, taking the first strike, bring Regina (Canada) to the red. It may well be the first city to flip.

  narration: Oh boy. I forgot how utterly surrounded Canada is by Inuit territory.
    This is going to be brutal. Especially since the Inuit have multiple nuclear missiles
    ready near Canada’s very heartland.

  narration: Additional nukes are in the Inuit exclave of Hamilton, though they better
    be used soon. The city seems quite likely to be captured.

  narration: The Finnish exclave of Hsia is already fortified with a strong garrison
    of air units. Mongolia has also gone to work rebuilding after the Asian wars,
    and to be honest, they aren’t looking too bad. At least they have modern armor
    now. That’s pretty nice.

  narration: A view of Boer-owned Mali and another look at a Bio Drone unit. The Boer
    carpet here isn’t that dense, but that’s just because the area was recently conquered.
    Give him a few turns and I’m sure Paul Kruger’s new lands will be coated in orange.

  narration: We also have an image of the ranged unit tech tree. The Bio Drone, as
    you can see, is the final unit in the upgrade path. It’s got a combat strength
    of 80, a ranged strength of 120, range 3, movement 4, AND the march upgrade. In
    other words, it’s f***ing scary.

  narration: The Buccs and Finns make peace, ending a mostly unimportant, yet symbolic
    war. The Buccaneer core is still stuffed with carriers.

  narration: Hmmm. Not much has happened in the Mexico-Blackfoot war. Things are stagnating
    and the nations are just facing off across a few mountain passes, exactly what
    I was afraid would happen.

  narration: Morocco actually has an decent navy of destroyers. Unfortunately, they’ve
    failed to move it East into the Mediterranean, which would help keep Sparta from
    capturing Carthage. Morocco’s ground forces, of course, are almost nonexistent.

  narration: Things get nasty between Canada and the Inuit. Lester B. Pearson (Canada)
    orders his legions forward and brings down the health of Ikaluksomething and Hamilton,
    two heavily-surrounded Inuit cities. The White Walkers had best move their air
    units before the cities fall.

  narration: Canada’s turn continues, and Pearson starts bringing destroyers through
    the narrow arctic straits. They have yet to seriously damage any of the northern
    Inuit cities, however.

  narration: he Trung Sisters (Vietnam) are plotting against everyone and their mother.
    This time, the crafty duo have their eyes set on Tibet. I think we all know who’d
    come out on top of that conflict.

  narration: Still no city captures between Mexico and the Blackfoot, but the strangely
    named Blackfoot city “A’Annn” looks like it’ll fall any minute. With zero health
    and a tank on its doorstep, the city is as good as gone.

  narration: 'And it’s on to the Info Addict slides! In population, things are about
    the same as last time with one big exception: the Boers. The Boer population has
    rocketed up by an astounding 50 million, allowing the Orange Empire to displace
    Australia at the top of this list.'

  narration: 'Down at the bottom we see the usual suspects: city states and other
    weak nations. Mongolia’s population is especially disappointing, given their relatively
    large land area.'

  narration: The Boers, almost topping 3 million in total military strength, are stronger
    than ever. Vietnam comes in second place this time, with Australia close behind.
    Finland and the Inuit have dropped a bit, probably due to their recent wars.

    Nothing new here. Australia is still the City God. Henry Parkes controls more cities than Sweden, Canada, Brazil and Yakutia combined.
    So.... RIP TPang‘s computer.

  narration: 'Another category where the Boers knocked Australia out of the top spot.
    The Boer science output here is about 2,000 higher than last part, allowing Paul
    Kruger to retake #1 from his green and gold rivals.'

  narration: 'Boers are #1 here with 99 techs. Only the Inuit are close to the Boers;
    most top-tier civs are in the 70’s.'

  narration: The religion slide has no surprises. Catholicism is supreme, while Islam
    has fewer followers every day.

    And finally, we have the religion map. Only the very tip of South America and a couple islands remain aethiestic.
    And with that said, my time as a narrator draws to a close. I’m /u/CrucibleOfTraining, and I’ve had an absolute blast narrating this segment of the Mk II BR. You stay classy, /r/civbattleroyale ;)
