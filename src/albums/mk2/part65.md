  narration: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen to the r/Civ/ Battle Royal part 65!
    I’m your narrator last- minute, first time narrator Whitefang131, and this right
    here is the cylinder. It’s a very nice cylinder, our cylinder, which has been
    depicted by /u/Cadellinman.

  narration: And this is a map depicting the current state of the cylinder at the
    end of the last part, created by /u/LacsiraxAriscal and /u/Malssistra, and what
    an exciting and unexpected part that was! So many wars, so much blood to be spilled
    in the upcoming part.

    A single slide from the Power Rankings of the last part! Not particularly surprising is the leader of the rankings at the moment; the Boers, who reclaimed first place from the Inuit.

  narration: Brought to you by /u/Sittingonchairs1 is a current analysis of the wars
    currently going on, and who is fighting who. I’ll probably be referring back to
    this because of how many wars there are right now! (and how glad I am for that)

  narration: |-
    We kick off the part with a bit of Mexican brutalizing, as the Buccaneers sweep through Central America, once the Mexican reinforcements near Austin have been taken care of, Laredo will most likely remain in Henry Morgan’s hands, but I predict that Guadalaraja will flip some more, since it’s much easier for Mexican forces to reach due to their railroad leading to the city.
    Also note the small detachment of the Wobbegong Armada sent to aggravate Waipahu, originally a Polynesian city, before it was basically slaughtered, but here we see it has regained some of it’s population, but for how long?
- scene_number: "6"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene06.jpg
  narration: Oh this hurts my Spartan sole, seeing the Boers blitz the Mediterranean,
    taking the Italian cities which were taken by Leonidas so long ago. The Spartan
    naval carpet is all but gone in this area of the fighting, and the Boers are making
    significant gains, while Rome falls again to Ingolfur (Iceland). While Leonidas
    could flip Manitnea back, he won’t hold it, and all other cities in the area will
    almost definitely remain in Kruger’s hands (Excluding Rome).
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene07.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile, Mexico is dropping bombs all over Blackfoot cities, and has
    pushed Paratroopers into the Blackfoot core. Ahahpitape looks like it’s got a
    few flips left in it, but A`aninn looks like it will stay in Benito’s (Mexico)
    hands.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene08.jpg
  narration: A massive counterstrike of Global Offence has struck Henry Morgan right
    in the face, and Benito takes back Guadalaraja and drops a threatening amount
    of units in the area, Henry will suffer large losses taking back Guadalaraja,
    if he does.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene09.jpg
  narration: Australian Japan has suffered greatly, and all cities are heavily damaged,
    fallout remains near Wakayama after a cheeky nuke was dropped on it. In comparison
    to the Australian core, this area looks very half empty. Or half full.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene10.jpg
  narration: "Yakutia, realising their mistake in invoking the Wrath of Japan, peace
    out and pray for forgiveness. And in the theatre of the Khanflict, Trigger Darkhan
    (Yakutia) and Sejong (Korea) are seriously throwing down, with both sides have
    extensively damaged cities near each other’s borders. \nBut Sejong has the numbers
    to push, which he should take advantage of, if he wants to become a serious power."
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene11.jpg
  narration: "Haile Salassie (Ethiopia) declares war on Genghis Khan (Mongolia). Previously
    Ethiopia was home to the travelling Mongolian Prophet. Sadly, his whereabouts
    are unkown. \nWould you look at that carpet though! The size of it is enough to
    make Kruger struggle with pushing through, if he ever decides to declare war.
    Meanwhile, David (Israel) sits with Haile in pure fear as he is housing more Ethiopian
    soldiers than his actual people."
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene12.jpg
  narration: The Spartans whittle down Yerevan and have Artashat firmly in their grasp,
    but they’re looking quite thin, their wars in the west must be wearing down on
    them very, very hard. Also of note is how Vietnam has already incorporated Persia
    into their empire with vicious efficiency.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene13.jpg
  narration: As if he hasn’t got enough troubles right now, Semiramis reports that
    Gustuavus (Sweden) is plotting against Leonidas. If they decide to go to war as
    well, it could spell the end of Sparta very quickly. It should be noted that due
    to Kruger (Boers) taking Mantinea, Sparta and Iceland no longer share a border.
    Unfortunately they still share a border with Kruger, who has decided to be thorough
    with his invasion thus far.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene14.jpg
  narration: Tygyn, being the kind hearted man he is, has decided to continue to allow
    Brazilian soldiers holiday throughout his lands. He has not learned. However Finnish
    peacekeepers are his saving grace currently, preventing Sibir forces from gaining
    access to Yakutian lands and flipping Amga, which is very low on health. In the
    west, Yakutia and Finland beat up on Mongolia, likely while Kekkonen and Tygyn
    laugh and reminisce about the good times when they first attacked Genghis.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene15.jpg
  narration: In the south Tiflus is likely to fall to either Genghis or Sejong, as
    it is very low on health and both have units in the area. Boer peacekeepers stare
    into the sight of the battles, infuriated that they can only keep the peace in
    Genghis’ lands.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene16.jpg
  narration: More carnage, more destruction, it’s amazing. Parkes looks like he might
    be getting a little liberal with his nukes, and for that we love him dearly. But
    for all his efforts it looks as if Cebu will fall, only a paratrooper guards it
    from a Vietnamese horde.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene17.jpg
  narration: Boy he did it. He really did it. Parkes nuked Hanoi the crazy bastard.
    Buddhist monks are infuriated because it killed all the good trees that they used
    to sit under. The Trungs (Vietnam) have a settler out and about in preparation
    for when one of their cities gets nuked off the face of the cylinder.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene18.jpg
  narration: The Trungs push on Australian Sri Lanka and take several cities, all
    of which are unlikely to flip back, due to the lack of Australian reinforcements.
    An Inuit scout enjoys the bloodshed from just outside Colombo, as he sweats vigorously
    in the heat.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene19.jpg
  narration: Boer and Icelandic units land on Greece, and it looks as if Ingolfur’s
    paratrooper might flip Sparta, while Kruger surrounds Messene with XCOM soldiers.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene20.jpg
  narration: "… Wow. Kekkonen (Finland) decides he wants to finish what he started,
    and alongside Sri Lanka and Sibir, dives for Leonidas’ neck to kill him before
    the Boers or Ingolfur does. And with all those paratroopers, Kekkonen might do
    some very serious damage in the eastern half of Sparta."
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene21.jpg
  narration: Three civilizations divide Greece equally between them, as Leonidas Greek
    splits right out of there. Kekkonen has also taken Trebizond with great speed.
    This looks to be the end for Leonidas now.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene22.jpg
  narration: As soon as Kekkonen joined this battle, the eastern half of the Spartan
    Empire (Rather the core of it now) was massively damaged, and Varna was ripped
    from Leonidas. Leonidas has only a handful of units left, whereas Kekkonen has
    an entire carpet of paratroopers within range of Leonidas’ lands.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene23.jpg
  narration: The Trungs push again on Australian Sri Lanka, still not Australian reinforcements
    in sight.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene24.jpg
  narration: Sejong has made considerable gains, taking Tiflis, Tyokhtyur, Ambarchik,
    and the Yakutian capital of Jokusai. Tygyn seems to have contracted a virus called
    Mithridatesism, and his civilians now outnumber his combat units in this slide.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene25.jpg
  narration: Kekkonen continues to carve up Mongolia, and looks like he intends to
    take Kazan. Sibir still hasn’t broken through into Yakutian lands to take Amga.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene26.jpg
  narration: Back in the other major theatre of war, Benito makes a significant push
    against Henry Morgan, and it looks like I might eat my earlier words, as he looks
    as if he could take Laredo. Meanwhile the other Henry (Australia) takes both Merida
    and Waipahu, though he hasn’t reinforced them as of yet.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene27.jpg
  narration: Chile takes back their capital! I honestly didn’t see this coming. Henry
    Parkes seems to have given up on his second war with Chile, most likely to either
    focus on Mexico or Vietnam. But in any case, it’s highly likely Pedro (Brazil)
    will take over Santiago de Chile again.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene28.jpg
  narration: Meanwhile in Pirate Portugal, where land units are an option, not necessary,
    Henry Morgan plans to beat a dead horse with the ribs it’s already lost from everyone
    else kicking the hell out of it, and plots against Leonidas. But since he now
    has to go though both Icelandic and Boer territory to reach Sparta, it’s doubtful
    he’d do anything useful even if he did declare war.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene29.jpg
  narration: After losing his capital, as well as two others, Leonidas peaces out
    with Kruger and Ingolfur. However, in a rage fueled by steroids and pre-workout
    drinks, Leonidas and his men take back Eus, Trebizond and Varna from Kekkonen.
    It’s almost as if Kekkonen joining the war woke something up in Leonidas, an age
    old fury and lust for revenge.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene30.jpg
  narration: Tygyn takes back Jokusai, but he’s looking very thin right now, he needs
    to make a peace deal or he could lose even more.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene31.jpg
  narration: Nestled between the Trungs very comfortably is Tibet, and look how cute
    they are, making their very own peace deals with Persia, lil cuties.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene32.jpg
  narration: As the hot potato that is Jokuskai gets thrown again, Sejong catches
    it, and looking at how few units Tygyn has left, it looks like it’s likely to
    stay Korean. Oh how the mighty have fallen.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene33.jpg
  narration: These crazy Chileans. In a peace deal with Henry Parkes, who was leaving
    them alone, Chile gives them a city, a city with a lot of land area.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene34.jpg
  narration: "BOY HE DID IT. THE LONE RANGER HAS STOOD UP TO THE MEXICAN TYRANT AND
    WILL LAY THE SMACKDOWN! In all seriousness, Texas actually has a chance to gain
    here, if the Buccaneers manage to push back and weaken the surrounding cities,
    otherwise, this is a suicide. Speaking of the Buccaneers, they’ve lost Laredo,
    and I am currently in the process of eating my words. \nAlso worth noting the
    the 'use Nuke' bias for the Texans is abnormally high."
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene35.jpg
  narration: Crowfoot is looking a bit on the thin side these days, as Benito starts
    to damage his core, and gaps are widening within his own ranks. Aamsskaapipikani
    looks to flip to Mexican paratroopers.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene36.jpg
  narration: Well the hate driven fury didn’t last long, and Leonidas loses all the
    cities he took back, as well as Tigranocerta, while Nicomedia looks likely to
    fall. Over in the east, Gyumbri looks like it’s going to fall to Sibir, who has
    two paratroopers next to the very low health city.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene37.jpg
  narration: Nevermind it’s not Gyumbri that was going to fall to Kuchum (Sibir),
    it was in fact Artashat, but most likely followed by Gyumbri.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene38.jpg
  narration: All Australian cities on India have been taken by Vietnam, but two valiant
    great generals remain, to die a horrible death. The loss of this area must be
    due in part to the airplanes stored on the many carries Vietnam has in the area.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene39.jpg
  narration: Koreans have Giant Death Robots! Their tech truly is skyrocketing, and
    is only going to increase after this war with Yakutia. Speaking of Yakutia, and
    age old rivalry flares up again as the Inuit take Isit, and aside from an all
    but dead, embarked modern armour, Tygyn has no nearby melee units to take it back.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene40.jpg
  narration: Korea continues to push Mongolia, and takes Shanghai, while pushing towards
    Tabriz from the south and east. But the real news here is that the Finnish paratruupers
    just got an upgrade! Now armed with XCOM squads, bordergore will spread far and
    wide. This also spells very bad news for Sparta.
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene41.jpg
  narration: And so Korea takes Tabriz, and their push loses no speed as they continue
    forward to either Beshbalik or Dalandzadgad, both very low health cities. Boer
    peacekeepers look on in shock as so many die despite their best efforts.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene42.jpg
  narration: Another showing of the Giant Death Robot. Also something I should have
    pointed out, Finnish units are outnumbering Yakutian by a massive amount, as I
    believe most of Darkhan’s units are in the west of his empire.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene43.jpg
  narration: Texas takes Laredo! Buccaneer forces must have weakened Mexico enough
    for Texas to have slipped in and…. Good god. Texas is housing an atomic bomb.
    He’s going to do it.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene44.jpg
  narration: He did it. Texas just nuked Mexico. It’s a beautiful thing, to see a
    rump state declare war on a much more powerful neighbour and then nuke them. Godspeed
    Texas, godspeed.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene45.jpg
  narration: The devastation of the nuke will be felt for a while now by Mexico, and
    I’m sure Texas will be punished for this at some point. Meanwhile, to the north,
    Mexico has taken Aamsskaapipikani.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene46.jpg
  narration: Outrage in the Inuit lands as seals are banned by the world. From aboard
    a dilapidated Destroyer Lester (Canada) has voted 7 times just to bring down the
    Inuit. For all the good it will do.
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene47.jpg
  narration: Well, shows what I know, Gyumri didn’t fall to Sibir, instead to Finland.
    Nicomedia was also taken, and Epidauros looks to follow suite. Spartan forces
    are very scarce now, and it looks like from now on it could be a Finnish steamroll
    with their new XCOMs.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene48.jpg
  narration: Most of the fallout around Hanoi has been cleared out, the same cannot
    be said for Australian Japan.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene49.jpg
  narration: Leonidas will not die without a fight. In another rush he takes back
    Trebizond from Kekkonen. Sparta has fought very stubbornly in their dogpile war,
    despite the odds, but now it’s looking close to the end.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene50.jpg
  narration: Despite his numerical and technological inferiority, Tygyn Darkhan takes
    Jokusai and Tiflis from Korea, and no doubt the Finnish owned Turfan is making
    it very hard for Sejong to push forward, instead either having to paradrop over
    or go around.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene51.jpg
  narration: Stealth bombers abound in Khoro, Finland will undoubtedly put these to
    good use, and along with their XCOMs, they could very well take more cities during
    the Khanflict.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene52.jpg
  narration: And so Sejong’s involvement in the Khanflict comes to an end, as a peace
    deal is struck between him and Tygyn, who has kept his capital city, but lost
    Tiflis and Ytyk-Kyyuyol since we last saw this area. Sejong has done extremely
    well recently and this could be a way for him to achieve a great amount of power,
    assuming all this warmongering hasn’t pissed off the Trungs.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene53.jpg
  narration: Now that they are unbothered by Sejong, the horselords can throw down,
    mono e mono (Aside from Sibir but they haven’t done anything on account of Finnish
    peacekeepers.) However, both sides are extremely tired from the fighting with
    Korea, especially Yakutia, who still has less land units than civilians. However
    it seems like the fighting will need to funnel through the two land tiles connecting
    Khonuu to Hsia and Almarikh.
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: Image 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene54.jpg
  narration: You’re late, Gus. This would have been much more timely back when Sparta
    was still in Sparta. Well, Kekkonen has made further gains against Sparta, taking
    Epidauros and Hebron, as well as taking back Trebizond.
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene55.jpg
  narration: Parkes declares war against Kekkonen, you may think this to be irrelevant.
    But it isn’t. Sorta. They’ve both got units in Icelandic France, so there will
    be fighting there. To absolutely no end whatsoever.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene56.jpg
  narration: Well Parkes got as good as he gave, possibly more, as he takes even more
    nukes from the Trungs, that entire area will be at risk if it’s not reinforced.
- scene_number: "57"
  scene_title: Image 57
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene57.jpg
  narration: A Persian Privateer sails meekly past ships of aluminum, in a land far
    from home. The captain sighed a heavy sigh, and cursed to the gods again that
    he was a man with no home.
- scene_number: "58"
  scene_title: Image 58
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene58.jpg
  narration: A Texan musician plays the most inspiring battle songs Texas has ever
    heard, and the sons of Austin charge towards Mexico, emboldened by their nuking.
- scene_number: "59"
  scene_title: Image 59
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene59.jpg
  narration: Somehow. Somehow Brazil hasn’t managed to take a single city from Chile
    this part. How? Pedro, you are a massive, technologically advanced, time proven
    enemy of Chile. Come on mate! Do something! Anything!
- scene_number: "60"
  scene_title: Image 60
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene60.jpg
  narration: As Cebu is surrounded by Vietnamese troops, Iloilo falls to the Trungs,
    this is rather surprising, due to Parkes’ lead in production, he should have the
    upper hand by now, but he hasn’t made any significant gains in this war, in fact
    he’s done the opposite. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese showcase their power armour
    infantry, further demonstrating their power.
- scene_number: "61"
  scene_title: Image 61
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene61.jpg
  narration: See? Look at this! Parkes, send it up, we want blood! Spies also report
    that Parkes is launching a sneak naval attack, so maybe he might actually push
    against the Trungs sometime soon. Maybe.
- scene_number: "62"
  scene_title: Image 62
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part65-scene62.jpg
  narration: But speaking of sneak attacks, look at all of these. Henry Morgan plans
    to attack Immortal Chairman Mao, a battle he cannot win. But looking at Semiramis’
    report earlier in the part, maybe the spies are lying out of their teeth about
    sneak attacks and whatnot for once.

  narration: And so we come to the infoaddict slides, beginning with Paul Kruger the
    Terrible of the Boers, who is coming first in most things, including military.
    This shows just how much this war has taken out of Vietnam and Australia, who
    both previously were beating Kruger in manpower.

  narration: The population gap between Parkes and Kruger is stunning, 450 million
    population! And Parkes is second place in population, there’s no question as to
    how Kruger is getting all that science!

  narration: Looking between the Trung’s info and Parkes’, you’d assume their war
    would be quite easy for Parkes, but it really hasn’t been, strange given the production
    and science gap between the two.

  narration: The Inuit edge out ahead of Australia by two cities to take top spot
    on the cities list. If Ekeuhnick really wanted to, he could have taken the rest
    of North America by now, with his technology, production and city count. But unfortunately,
    he just isn’t willing to spill the blood required.

  narration: And so we come to Kuchum Khan of Sibir, currently in third place with
    military manpower, Kuchum has a good opportunity right now to attack Vietnam or
    Mongolia, if he capitalizes, he could become a massive threat in the game.

  narration: Next is Captain Kekkonen of Finland, who has performed very well this
    part, absolutely destroying the Middle-Eastern portion of Sparta. Given his city
    count, he’s been keeping pace with titans like Vietnam and Sibir, which is impressive
    in and of itself.

  narration: Next is Henry Morgan, another man with some opportunities presented to
    him. He could try to damage Brazil, who are being so magnificently quiet recently,
    or he could even attack Parkes, if he so dares.

  narration: We come to Master Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who has performed well
    this game, coming up very quickly to become a large power in Europe, enough to
    challenge previously established superpowers Finland and Iceland.

  narration: Speaking of Iceland we have Ingolfur Arnarson of Iceland, who really
    doesn’t have many opportunities currently, aside from attacking Henry Morgan and
    possibly gaining Iberia and Morocco. Ingolfur has performed very well in my own
    opinion, coming from a rock of ice and a small island, he conquered Ireland and
    the UK before bltizing France, and now he has a small chunk of the Mediterranean
    .

  narration: Sejong the Terrible is up next, Sejong has done well recently, declaring
    on two week neighbours, his only fault is not continuing these wars when he really
    had the potential to do so. That said, with their new cities, Korea’s science
    could rocket up, which presents it’s own set of opportunities.

  narration: Here we have the Religion slide, and the hardcore followers of the Ayyyyyyubid
    Party Pope are still around. Catholicism is still the largest religion around,
    with 50 more cities than Judaism and about 400 more followers too.

    lives on in this religion map. Sorta.

    And finally here is the Club of Losers, created by /u/Jru247. I’ve been Whitefang131, your narrator for the /r/Civ Battle Royale part 56! Take care all!
    See you next Sunday!
