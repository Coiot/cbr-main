  narration: The weekly installment of the Tile Accurate Map, where we see that Brazil
    is, in fact, rather large.

  narration: "/u/Vhireaa’s wonderful hand-drawn map is most people’s first look at
    how the world has changed, as it is consistently uploaded day of the part’s release.
    As such, I find that it is among the most exciting pieces of OC that the sub has
    to offer."

  narration: 'It comes as no surprise that Brazil is #1 again, but when I look back,
    it‘s crazy to think that only 19 parts ago the Boers were still cleanly #1, and
    yet here we are. Before this 18 part streak, the Boers had the longest #1 streak
    from parts 87-100.'

  narration: And so the action begins! Starting with The Great Melting of the Inuit
    empire, where Brazil has taken Samara. The citizens of Ivvavik, numbering less
    and less with each passing day, have stopped resisting Brazilian occupation. They
    put up a hell of a fight, but now they must embrace the Carnival.

  narration: Moving East tells a dramatic story. The Inuit have lost the cities of
    Rybnik and Trivakramapura. With the fall of these two cities, and no means of
    taking them back, the Inuit’s once mighty North American core has been entirely
    relegated to the confines of Alaska.

  narration: A squadron of workers leave the Saskatoon city boundaries. The workers,
    Inuit by birth and Canadian by ancestry, had been living a peaceful life in the
    rich Inuit heartland, but in the past years brutal bombings from Icelandic and
    Brazilian planes tore the city into ruins. It seemed a hell that never ended,
    but suddenly the planes stopped flying overhead. The Inuit had been chased out
    of the region, Brazil was now protector of these lands.
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene08.jpg
  narration: We pick up where we left off in the race for 8th place, as the Island
    Nation of Greenland loses the city of Njardvik. Ingólfur Arnarson, now stationed
    in Selfoss, is informed of their loss. They are down to their last three cities,
    and they are running out of men to defend it.
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: 9
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene09.jpg
  narration: Woaaaah! Well if Arnarson was running towards the finish line, it seems
    Gustavus Adolphus was sprinting! He’s lost the cities of Norrkoping and the temporary
    capital of Linkoping, and there are two Brazilian melee units ready to capture
    their last city, Tromso, now at under half health.
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene10.jpg
  narration: Brazil fails to take a city, but with overwhelming military superiority,
    it is only inevitable that Sibir will lose in the grand scheme of things.. The
    city of Dijon is also nuked off the map here.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene11.jpg
  narration: Last part, the great Sibir lost its capital, Qashliq. Brazil has since
    fortified the great city, as well as pushing onwards. Ust-Kamennaya has also been
    swallowed by the Green Blob, with a fresh line of robot infantry defending their
    gains.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene12.jpg
  narration: Nukes are flying in the Southeastern regions of Sibir’s nation, and the
    city of Rutog, 12 population last we saw, has fallen victim to nuclear annihilation.
    Tiflis also still stands, despite being an exclave defended by only 2 units.
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene13.jpg
  narration: Little has changed on this front, as neither side sends much of an invasion
    force across the war-torn Yakutian homeland.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene14.jpg
  narration: Olenyok, a city 22-pop-strong last part, has been wiped off the map.
    It seems that Brazil would rather not worry about a naval invasion and instead
    chooses to destroy anyone halting his progress the easy way. The Great Melting
    is picking up at an alarming rate.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene15.jpg
  narration: Korea continues to defend stunningly well, perhaps they might even succeed
    at retaking Wotjulum.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene16.jpg
  narration: Korea has avoided losing cities in their core during this turn, though
    Suwon is surrounded and melee units near both Kaesong and Gangneung. Their defense
    is truly impressive, I must say.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene17.jpg
  narration: We see the last of Korea’s cities, including Jeonju and the newly allocated
    capital of Osaka, a city which originally belonged to Japan. Jeonju looks sure
    to fall.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene18.jpg
  narration: Nuclear warfare continues being the main strategy in the Brazil-Australia
    conflict, with the city of Geelong being the latest city taken off the map. Batam
    is also in yellow, though no nearby melee units could take it.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene19.jpg
  narration: Though only Saigon has taken damage of Vietnam’s onscreen cities, it
    is the other cities that look prime to fall. Hai Phong, in particular, is almost
    entirely surrounded by Brazil’s mighty army, yet it is defended by a lone caravan.
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene20.jpg
  narration: Barnaul, a young city which had been settled recently by the Inuit, has
    been nuked off the map. This leaves 3 cities on mainland North America that do
    not yet belong to Pedro. Qausuittuq is also surrounded  by Brazilian troops and
    looks sure to fall.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene21.jpg
  narration: If it were not for the horrifying population per square mile, Coff’s
    harbour would likely be the world’s most peaceful city. The largest city in the
    world is totally isolated from the horrors of the world around them, and the millions
    living there have never known war.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene22.jpg
  narration: Every continent is threatened by Brazil. South America and Africa are
    both entirely owned by Brazil, and they don’t plan on stopping there. One city
    stops them from owning all of Europe, four stubborn Inuit cities remain halting
    their advance in North America, and finally these final two Australian cities
    remain in Antarctica. 10 planes in either city are all that remains of the defense.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene23.jpg
  narration: Welcome to Brazil’s 3rd (4th?) core! North America! The military presence
    highlighted here is probably matched only by all of Sibir or Australia’s army,
    despite this not being a warzone.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene24.jpg
  narration: My homeland in real life, the Western coast of North America looks peaceful.
    Despite this a massive standing army remains at all times, monitoring the citizens
    of these former Blackfoot and Mexican lands.
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene25.jpg
  narration: Once the capital of the most powerful nation in the world, Pretoria has
    been relegated to a small 8-pop city in Brazil’s 2nd core, Africa. Like everywhere
    else on the cylinder, Southern Africa is guarded by countless Brazilian soldiers.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene26.jpg
  narration: Frankly at this point you could paint your screen lime green and it would
    barely look different from this image.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene27.jpg
  narration: Thousands and thousands of years ago these lands belonged partially to
    the Ashanti. Though they were the 2nd civilization eliminated, their lands still
    stay relevant as the Green blob utilizes its resources.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene28.jpg
  narration: After that brief intermission, we return to the action. Greenland has
    been completely evicted from their the Western portion of their island with the
    fall of Mosfellsbaer, leaving the remnants of the nation eastward.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene29.jpg
  narration: Greenland has also lost the city of Selfoss to Brazil, leaving them at
    1 city, Akranes. No less than 4 melee units are in range of Arnarson’s final city,
    it seems they will fall very, very, soon.
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene30.jpg
  narration: Sweden has avoided elimination this turn, a miracle considering the position
    they found themselves in last turn. I believe their defense was made possible
    only thanks to the 10 planes stationed in Tromso. Nonetheless, they are well and
    truly out of units. 8th place is calling, Adolphus.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene31.jpg
  narration: Miraculously, it seems Sibir has once again lost not a single city on
    this front. Viroconium, Hameenlinna, and Pokrovskoye are low on health with Brazilian
    units approaching dangerously close, however.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene32.jpg
  narration: While this front continues to see little change, the defense of Tiflis
    is surprisingly effective, and despite it being surrounded on all sides by Sibir,
    they have made it to three turns of Brazilian occupation.
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene33.jpg
  narration: Another turn goes, and another city bites the dust. Tommor, one of Yakutia’s
    very earliest cities has been nuked off the map by Brazil.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene34.jpg
  narration: Korea is somehow still defending like a champion, managing to avoid losing
    a single city for two turns straight. For the record, they are the only civ left
    in the game other than Brazil itself to not lose a single city these last two
    turns. That‘s one hell of a defense for a civilization that went into Total war
    in 9th place, 17 cities strong.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene35.jpg
  narration: Vietnam is coming dangerously close to losing Hanoi, as they lose both
    Bago and Mawlamyine (offscreen) this turn. On top of this, Hanoi, Vijaya, and
    Hoi An are all below half health and totally surrounded by Brazilian units.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene36.jpg
  narration: Another city is blown off the map, this time it‘s Strangnas. Its crazy
    how numbed we have become to the thought of a city, millions of civilians inside,
    being wiped off the planet entirely.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene37.jpg
  narration: 'BREAKING NEWS: A single division of robot infantry approaches full health
    Honolulu. “I have a bad feeling about this” said the division’s leader when pressed
    by journalists.'
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene38.jpg
  narration: As another Australian city is blown to bits by nuclear weapons, the people
    of Traralgon know that it is up to them to put up Antarctica’s final stand.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene39.jpg
  narration: And so the tale of Ingolfur Arnarson ends today. The terror of the North
    began his rise to the top from humble origins. An isolated island on the outskirts
    of Europe, the Icelandic people seemed doomed from the getgo, getting initially
    ranked 56th of the 61 civilizations in the cylinder. Despite this, they took advantage
    of every situation they could, settling all of Greenland and launching an invasion
    on Ireland while they were weak. Now in control of the British Isles, Iceland’s
    navy was matched only by the Buccaneers, and with a solid army to boot it was
    only a matter of time before the great Arnarson made landing in Europe. Finally,
    the opportunity came when a war against France dawned. Over the following centuries,
    France, Sparta, and the Buccaneers would lose all of their territory in Europe
    to Iceland. By part 75, Iceland had risen to 5th place in the Power Rankings,
    an all-time high. Though they seemed strong, a stagnant empire would only take
    them so far, and after 71 parts in the top 10, they are finally eliminated in…
    7th?
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>For, I believe, the first time in CBR history, two civilizations
    were eliminated at the exact same turn. It’s hard to believe that amongst the
    thousands of turns this game has seen, two civilizations would die on one together,
    but here we are.</p> <p>Gustavus Adolphus, the Lion of the North and for a time
    the dominant force in Europe, has seen his fair share of conflicts, dating back
    to some of the earliest eliminations in the CBR. Despite starting off ranked 59th
    of the starting 61 civilizations, Sweden gained a reputation for intelligent warring
    early on, taking down both Nazi Germany and Poland within the first 30 parts and
    gaining land on mainland Europe. From there they maintained a strong core, all
    the while winning extra wars that would bring about the downfalls of Sparta and
    Norway. Sweden fought its way to becoming one of the final three European powers,
    vying for control against Iceland and Finland. It was a war against the latter
    that would bring Sweden fame and power, destroying any chances Finland had of
    winning, as well as bringing Sweden to a new record of 5th place in the Power
    Rankings. Even when all hope seemed lost and the Carnival turned to the Lion of
    the North, he defended magnificently well, earning him an all-time high of 4th
    place in the part 114 power rankings. Despite a strong defense, sweden’s tiny
    core was no match for the Brazilian army, and they finally succumbed 8 parts into
    Total War.</p>"
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Miraculously, all three of the cities I pointed out earlier did not
    fall, in fact they look safer now than before, which is pretty crazy on Kuchum’s
    part.</p> <p>I also wanted to talk more about what happened in the last two slides
    without making the all the text impossible to read on mobile so I’ll use the space
    that’s here instead. The previous part was called “The Race for 8th”, and yet,
    ironically, not a single civilization will be ranked 8th.</p>"
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene42.jpg
  narration: No cities have swapped hands on this front either, further proof of Kuchum’s
    ability to get the grind on. Bamda does, however, looked prime to fall, and I
    suspect Kuchum’s string of success ends with the city that won him his war against
    Vietnam.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene43.jpg
  narration: Yet again Tiflis is safe, but there are two melee units within range
    of the Brazilian exclave, meaning that perhaps Sibir could finally take action.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene44.jpg
  narration: Yakutia, once the strongest nation on the cylinder, is now the location
    of arguably the least relevant front in the game. Despite relatively flat terrain
    and tons of planes bombarding city after city, it seems no one is willing to send
    an army into some of the most poorly-defended cities on either civ’s border.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene45.jpg
  narration: It took until the final turn of the part for Korea to lose a city, and
    its the 1-pop city of Sendai, which fell to Brazil. Hamhung is low on health but
    Korea’s lands seems mostly Brazil-free, Hamhung included.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene46.jpg
  narration: Brazil is mounting an all-out attack on what remains of the Inuit, conquering
    the Aleutian city of Ahkaiyikokakinik (have fun there Dawk
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hoi An avoids the Carnival, but with Vijaya and Hanoi under Brazilian
    control, it is clear that Vietnam is on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Hanoi is
    an important city for a multitude of reasons. For one, this means that only Australia
    and Brazil remain in control of their original capitals, and second, Hanoi was
    the last capital in the world that had never once gone into enemy hands. Until
    now. Vietnam is left in a sorry situation, starting the part with 12 cities, they
    are now reduced to 7, with many sure to fall soon. Quite the fall from a civ that
    started total war with 66 cities. So now the question remains: Can anyone beat
    Vietnam in the race for 6th?</p>"
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part119-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>And so another part ends, with a rather anticlimactic view of Honolulu.
    We see that the robot infantry that entered Honolulu’s waters not long ago did
    indeed fail his mission to conquer the Polynesian capital, but that should surprise
    no one. This has been /u/Borsthestylish, thanks for reading.</p> <p>Okay well
    actually one last thing. I find it fascinating just how drastically Total War
    has changed my view of Korea. When Total War began, they had 17 cities. Iceland
    (48), Sweden (29), and the Buccs (23) all had more cities than Korea, yet they
    all found themselves dead well before. To add to that, Vietnam (66) now finds
    themselves at 7 cities, which is less than Korea. Finally, the Inuit began Total
    War with almost 1 million more soldiers and a whopping 76 cities, they now find
    themselves at only 16 cities (based on minimap), to Korea’s 10! Mad respect for
    the Turtle King.</p>"
