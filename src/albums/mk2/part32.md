  narration: |-
    It‘s finally back, guys! I‘m /u/senshidenshi, Guardian of Brisbane (bam double Innistrad reference on the first slide)* and I‘m narrating again for some reason! Yeah, I tend to narrate in emergency scenarios, sure, but... never mind.
    As always, be sure to check out the community at /r/civbattleroyale!

  narration: |-
    As always, here‘s the fantastic world map, created by /u/SylonL and /u/LacsiraxAriscal! However, the map _may_ not be perfectly accurate this time around. For those of you not in the loop, the latest save of the CBR that was functional was turn 314, and hence not everything that has happened has happened. Apparently most of the things are the same, all the civs that were dead last time, but certain things (such as the Australia/Vietnam DoW) never happened. Which means this is technically an alternate reality! Damn, I was really hoping I‘d be evil and have a moustache or something...
    Without further ado, let‘s begin!

  narration: |-
    A rare glimpse of the Australian core. It‘s very well-defended, but not nearly as carpeted as I assumed it‘d be. Also note they‘re defending their border with the Kimberley with pikemen. Then again, so are the Kimberley.
    Can‘t help but notice that resource icons are being displayed. Always happy to please, eh, TPangs? ;) ;) ;)

  narration: The Trungs complete the Eiffel Tower, another cultural wonder. Unlike
    Broadway, however, the Eiffel Tower doesn‘t risk me missing an obvious pun. Nice
    to see the great Vietnamese Cannon Carpet is still holding strong.

  narration: |-
    The French finally have Riflemen, or rather their Rifleman replacement, the Imperial Guard. IIRC, they‘re a stronger and more expensive Rifleman which gets Great Generals I. Nothing too insane, but it could definitely prove to be a boon.
    Also, note the apparent Irishness of the Isles, as well as the banished British fleet...
- scene_number: "6"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene06.jpg
  narration: Remember, I‘m about in the dark as you are about this reality (yet to
    meet Bizarro Senshi, either), but it seems to me Japan has been doing something
    combat-related. Has a war broken out?
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: 7
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene07.jpg
  narration: Lodz seems to be under relatively secure Spartan control, but Sweden
    has a more technologically advanced army (lancers and rifles, oh my!). Could the
    tides turn for either of these two powerhouses? Maybe. Who knows?
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: 8
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene08.jpg
  narration: |-
    Quite a few cities in the Isles are still Irish, but the Icelandic force is huge and the Irish one is tiny. This does not bode well for Malachy.
    Also, take a look at that French settler there! Are they hoping one of the cities will be razed or something?

  narration: 'Semiramis (Babylon‘s #3 agent IMO, Pashgalderamesh is a cool dude) gives
    us some extra French info, with a plot against Snoreway! With a less advanced
    navy and not much of a border to send it through, I don‘t think he can really
    do much.'
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene10.jpg
  narration: Warsaw falls into Spartan hands, but Sweden has a much better position
    in the area. They‘ll probably take it back.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene11.jpg
  narration: A sole Kimberley scout stands on the offskirts of Atilla‘s Court, witnessing
    the carnage in front of him. At least, I assume there‘s carnage. There are units
    in other civs‘ borders which have taken damage. That‘s usually a good sign.
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene12.jpg
  narration: The World Fair is completed, and hosted in the Sibir ice flats! They
    have also apparently created a groundbreaking invention, as have Yakutia, Finland,
    Mexico, the Boers, Vietnam, Texas, Chile, Afghanistan,
- scene_number: "13"

    Ethiopia,
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene14.jpg
  narration: |-
    The Maori, the Inca, Canada, Armenia, France and Indonesia! Christ! Either the Cylinder was a hellhole beforehand, or we‘ve just had the craziest burst of technological advancement ever! How could they ALL have made something groundbreaking?!
    The Champa showed up, but their invention apparently wasn‘t ‘groundbreaking‘ enough. What did they bring? A sugar cube?
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene15.jpg
  narration: The Chilean settlement of Iquique, as well as an Escuadra Nacional. I
    swear, those things get everywhere.
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene16.jpg
  narration: See, this is where the Escuadra Nacional SHOULD be, rather than dicking
    about in Antarctica! Buenos Aires is still in Chilean control, but Argentina seems
    to have fortified their defences quite well. Might be hard for either Chile or
    Brazil to advance.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene17.jpg
  narration: The Mayans are still sporting LONGSWORDSMEN. If anyone in the area put
    up a real offensive, they‘d probably take a city. This includes the Maori.
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene18.jpg
  narration: The Canadians (and maybe Texas as well, but it seems mainly Canada) have
    New York down to zero, but nobody has a single melee unit in the area. Good job.
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene19.jpg
  narration: Canada seems to be having the exact same problem with Itazipcho, but
    this time they have considerably less of an excuse. At least they might be able
    to get a Privateer in...
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene20.jpg
  narration: |-
    Derry is now Icelandic, and the Irish barely have an army around their capital. It seems the Isles shall become frozen over... Icy Isles is still an atrocious name...
    Also, the French Settler is still looking for a spot in Ireland...
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene21.jpg
  narration: |-
    Tabriz is in the yellow. Using my amazing observational skills (Just call me Sherlock Denshi), I sense that in this universe Mongolia and China are at war!
    Genghis seems to only have Ranged Units in the area, though. Or in general.
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene22.jpg
  narration: |-
    Nottingham falls to Iceland, leaving only three Irish cities.
    FUN FACT: There are more French settlers on this slide than there are Irish melee units.
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene23.jpg
  narration: There‘s a large variety of boats on this slide, and I don‘t have any
    clue who‘s at war with who. The Maori are edging closest, though, so hopefully
    we‘ll get a transcontinental city capture.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene24.jpg
  narration: Itazipcho is Canadian, but New York is STILL at zero. Luckily(?), a Canadian
    rifleman has finally made its way into American territory. Could this be when
    cities start to flip?
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene25.jpg
  narration: The Ethiopians have the Mehal Sefari, an excellent unit when defending
    and still better than the Rifleman when attacking. I don‘t think the Ayyubids
    are at war due to the lack of damage done, but if they were Baalbek would be basically
    doomed.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene26.jpg
  narration: Morelia is grabbed by the Sibir, who are also sending bands of units
    into the realm of the Timurids. They might need to send some bands towards their
    new holding, as well, or else it will fall back to the Soviets.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene27.jpg
  narration: If the Sri Lankans and Mughals are still at war, they seem to have basically
    neutralised each other. Burma has Isoroku Yamamoto on their side, but I think
    I‘ve done a joke about a WWII-era Japanese military man DEFENDING South East Asia
    already.
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene28.jpg
  narration: |-
    Dublin falls to Iceland, to be shortly followed by Canterbury and London. Probably.
    FUN FACT: Again, the French Settler Army takes up more space than the Irish one.
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene29.jpg
  narration: |-
    Em wisely flees Dublin (secret facility under Ireland CONFIRMED) as Canada remains in control of their western holdings, despite the Blackfoot understanding how melee units work.
    Can‘t help but notice that Canada has garrisoned a certain artillery ;) ;) ;)
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene30.jpg
  narration: Not much change on the Argentine front. For a second I thought Bernardo
    had pulled out. But no, it was the other white-star-on-dark-blue-background civ.
    Easy mistake to make?
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene31.jpg
  narration: More Canadian forces approach the very pleasant-looking American capital.
    Could this be the beginning of the end for Lincoln?
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene32.jpg
  narration: 'Wham Bam! Uxmal falls to the Maori of all people, which I believe is
    the furthest city capture from the starting position? Might be wrong, who knows?
    Anyway, it‘s still really cool. You know what they say about the Maori: Anywhere
    else, they would be a superpower. This could be that anywhere else. But that‘s
    an extremely optimistic view.'
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene33.jpg
  narration: Outraged at the premise of the Maori actually doing something of note,
    Sejong declares war. Personally, I don‘t believe much will come of it.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene34.jpg
  narration: Jandamarra also declares war on the Maori, ending any possible anti-Australia
    alliance in the area. Then again, knowing what Jandamarra was like IRL...
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene35.jpg
  narration: |-
    When I saw South Africa and a DOW notification, I got slightly excited. We all just got TPANGSED!
    Still, this does suggest Meiji considers himself stronger than Shaka, and Meiji is pretty pathetic.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene36.jpg
  narration: Washington is basically dead; it‘ll probably flip to Canada at least
    once. At the same time, though, the American military presence means it‘ll probably
    just flip back.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene37.jpg
  narration: Champa declares war on Sri Lanka, but their entire navy is on the wrong
    side of the archipelago. This gives Sri Lanka a chance to charge at, say, Lam
    Ap Pho. Great military tactics, Che. Good job.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene38.jpg
  narration: |-
    Oh boy! We got double bluffed!
    The Boers finally declare on the Zulus, and look to debilitate their forces pretty quickly.
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene39.jpg
  narration: The Boer navy already surround the offshore Zulu territories. All two
    of them.
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene40.jpg
  narration: Argentina adopts Order, putting them against much of the world thanks
    to Australia‘s crazy tourism. Brazil and Chile still haven‘t done much. Are they
    even at war?
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene41.jpg
  narration: Brazil immediately follows up with Autocracy, increasing the tension
    in the area even more. Well, hopefully.
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene42.jpg
  narration: New York falls to Texas, because they TOTALLY helped Canada take it down
    to nothing. Eh, Canada deserves it for only having ranged units.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene43.jpg
  narration: |-
    Leonidas completes Big Ben. I initially thought this wasn‘t a very Spartan act, but I thought for a moment and the name reeks of Sparta. It even has 'Big' in it! Come on, people, back me up on this!
    FUN FACT: This is the second slide in a row in which I‘ve restrained myself from referencing a 1970‘s-era song. See if you can guess what they are ;)
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene44.jpg
  narration: Afghanistan declares war on Sri Lanka. Despite Afghanistan generally
    doing pretty well, I doubt much will come of this. The border‘s too small.
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene45.jpg
  narration: Morelia is back in Soviet territory, but Tus, a superior city probably,
    seems primed to fall to the Siberians. Only two Timur melee units near the city
    as well, giving the Sibir forces a chance to get over there before the city can
    be retaken.
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene46.jpg
  narration: Itazipcho is leapt upon by Crowfoot. With no Canadian forces nearby,
    it may stay in his clutches. Not that Crowfoot is really a villain at all...
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene47.jpg
  narration: Ondini is first to fall to the Boers, and Nongoma doesn‘t seem to far
    behind. From there, it‘s only a short sail to the capital.
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene48.jpg
  narration: Parkesy declares war on Korea, and already has a Digger on the peninsula.
    Still, Australia‘s main asset is their navy, and Korea‘s ironclads and turtles
    could prove to be an uphill battle.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene49.jpg
  narration: See? Yet another Escuadra Nacional far from home- wait no. Nonononononono
    you have got to be kidding me! No way! It won‘t happen!
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene50.jpg
  narration: Jandamarra‘s DOW might not have been the best idea after all, as Maori
    ships surround his outposts...
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene51.jpg
  narration: As I predicted, the Sri Lankan navy rushes into Champa lands before they
    can really do much. Despite Sri Lanka‘s basically outdated navy, they have the
    potential to make some gains here. Well, A gain.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene52.jpg
  narration: Yep, Iceland is doomed. I don‘t even NEED to narrate these ones any more.
    The French Settler Squadron now outnumber the actual Irish defence force.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene53.jpg
  narration: Armenia has frigates in the little lake, while Merv takes damage and
    Tus doesn‘t. Much more crucially, however, the Legion has gotten out of their
    boats for a moment! Philistines! How dare they!
- scene_number: "54"
  scene_title: 54
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene54.jpg
  narration: Tabriz has probably been dead for years now. Mongolia suffers from what
    I‘ve recently deemed Canada Syndrome so hard I‘m becoming convinced Canada suffers
    from Mongolia syndrome...
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene55.jpg
  narration: The Yakut-Inuit front is suspiciously devoid of units. It seems most
    of the damage is being done by the stacks of planes Tygyn has stuffed into Suntar
    and Isit.
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: 56

  narration: |-
    Despite their flaws, Canada manages to take Washington, for the moment anyway. Hey, at least it wasn‘t that damn Escuadra Nacional.
    (Looking forward to seeing the voice narrator pronounce that as many times as I‘ve typed it >:D >:D >:D)

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene58.jpg
  narration: Buccaneers surround Palenque. It seems likely to fall. Not that that‘s
    a huge deal, the Mayans have been generally pathetic throughout the entirety of
    this adventure. I‘m glad to see the death of them.

  narration: The Spartans seem to be doing an excellent job at holding Warsaw. I see
    why they‘d want to keep it, though. It‘s a capital and everything, but more importantly
    it has a badass name. Just think about it! WAR SAW!
- scene_number: "62"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part32-scene62.jpg
  narration: Champa adopts Autocracy, and is pushing the Sri Lankan navy away from
    Simhapura. Could they turn this war around? They have the resources, the DoW was
    just badly timed...

  narration: Palenque falls to the Buccaneers, and, like that, Pacal is swept into
    the wind, never to rule again... His people become pirates or be shot down by
    their hands... Only two thousand, one hundred and twenty two years early, as well...

    Morelia seems likely to fall again, but all the Timurid forces in the area are
    ranged...

  narration: |-
    Gajah Mada and Che Bong Nga gang up on Burma. Still, seems like the work will be mostly done by Che, considering borders and the sort.
    The Champa are getting themselves into multiple naval wars at the same time. Not exactly a smart plan.

    Their Turtle Ships have surrounded Kyoto, and I don‘t see much reinforcements.
    Well, reinforcements that can actually get there. Is that wonderful FREE tile
    of our glorious FREE nation posing problems for you, Parkesy?

  narration: |-
    The last Irish city falls to Iceland. People sometimes prepare elegies for fallen competitors, but I believe a different kind of poetic style is more appropriate...
    There once was an old Irish chief,
    Who took London, to all‘s disbelief,
    ‘Twas all going great,
    ‘Til the Ice got irate,
    And sailed down to make his life quite brief.
    It‘s a masterpiece. A work of art.

  narration: America and Portugal make peace, after a very uninteresting war. Still,

  narration: |-
    And, with a religion map for some reason, we bring this part to a close. I‘ve been /u/senshidenshi, and I‘d just like to say:
    > It‘s great to have the CBR back!
    > I‘m looking forward to the future!
    > And, as always, sorry for the narration.
    G‘night!
