    Worldwide Boer Ryk
    Twelve Million Paratroopers
    Worldwide Brazil Ryk
    Welcome to the Civ Battle Royale part 110. I, Poblano, will be your narrator for this week, and if you can’t tell, there will be lots of haikus this part. Our OC for this week is a map of the Boers at their greatest extent. We can see now just how much they’ve lost. Poor, poor Boers.

  narration: "Inuit death comes\nNuclear hell consumes all\nWar never changes. \nLast
    week saw the Inuit make a fatal error: They declared on the Buccs, who had a defensive
    pact with Brazil(I guess the Buccs forgot that Brazil slaughtered them long ago).
    This will not end well for them. Nukes slaughtered their units that were stationed
    at the borders. This is the third Inuit-Brazil war since the reboot. Third time’s
    the charm, as they say."

    Once Mexican land
    No longer Mexicans here
    Only Carnival
    Coiot’s Note: Lunar will be joining Poblano narrating the odd numbered slides below the haikus.
    Xcoms are truly winning the war for Brazil here. Brazil also don‘t have open borders with Blackfoot but do with Kimberley. I see they recognize the true foes here.

    Puebla, Mexico
    Found “where serpents change their skin”
    And where XCOMs land
    Brazil seems to be focusing on taking every single former Mexican city, Puebla being the latest victim. Jeez, a nuclear war being fought over Mexico? Haven’t we seen this before? Quit with the re-runs Blue Cassette.

    Surprisingly it seems that Inuit have a strong defense here. Brazil is becoming weak and Inuit have ton of planes in the area. It seems that pushing beyond here will be tough. Of note: Cincinnati is now completely blocked off by Buccaneer Bordergore™

    No turtle ships now
    Nor hwach’a for Sejong
    No units at all
    Korea is running out of units quickly. Vietnam seems to be focusing on Korean coastal cities first, a wise strategy. Korea has no way to reinforce these cities. More importantly, Brazil and Vietnam do not have open borders. Brazil’s city in this region is just more ammo for the “Delete Brazil” camp.

    Pax Siberia
    When Jokuskai slept in peace
    The sleep is gone now
    Yakutian capital seems to the only thing flipping. I could see Tommot flipping once as well, but it seems to be flipping for once as they move east. I do however find it difficult for Korea to make long term gains here though.

    The Boer capital
    But only penguins live here
    The Boers are dead
    The Boers have been restricted to the antarctic. These cities do not hold any humans anymore. They have populated by robotic human-penguin hybrids for years. Now the robo-penguins are all that remains of the Boers. Australia declares war to try to get rid of the penguins.

    It seems the remains of former Texas proper are good health packs for this army as it moves onward. A good amount of Brazil disappeared as a good amount of Inuit form. If Ekeuhnick can hold, they might hold onto the husk of America. Also, Brazil has Giant Death Robots. Yeah. Moving on.

    Blackfoot Torreon
    Then Inuit Torreon
    Brazil Torreon
    It’s more likely that this front will flip over and over much like the Blackfoot Mexico war of old. War will be determined on the whims of central US. So it’s like the US election. Except with nukes, death and Brazilians.

    Do you remember?
    Mexico once laid claims here
    Mexico is dead
    The Brazilian push finally reaches cities that were originally Blackfoot, a testament to the amount of land the Blackfoot conquered from Mexico before the Inuit brutally slaughtered them.

    Morgan is alone
    The Buccaneers are officially surrounded on 3 sides by Brazil. There is no territory for them to conquer. The Buccaneers helped Brazil win this war by ruthlessly slinging nukes because they have nothing else to lose.

    Inuit collapse
    “Omae wa mou shindeiru”
    “NANI?” - Inuit
    Fort Rouille is a massive multiplayer shooter where sixty war trained warriors drop into a map and fight it to the death. Except they are all Brazilian. And just like the game that shall not be named, there is one flagy boi doing absolutely nothing waiting to die. Of actual note Iceland can probably make some gains here… is what I would say if Iceland had a single melee unit period.

    Fifty words for snow
    yet no words for “a defeat”
    No need, until now
    Out of nowhere, a great mass of Brazilian units appears to greet the Inuit defenders. I wonder if this how people felt when the mongols invaded in. A great number of cities fall. The Inuit have never tasted defeat before.

    New York has fallen
    Was the carnival worth it?
    Billions have now died
    I used to think it was unlikely that the front wouldn’t be supplied by Brazil, but I think I know why more units keep on appearing here. Brazil have been using airports to teleport units to the frontline using Inuits well developed territory, turning the roads that Inuit made in their sleep to their advantage to bring units from the core. If Inuit was joined with a power like Sibir, this war might be less decisive, but all units generated by Brazil appear in the front, airdrop to the front and paradrop to the warfront. Unless Sibir attacks now, this is over folks.

    And Vietnam has no seoul
    Rach Dia is free
    Well, way to make me look dumb, Vietnam. Rach dia doesn’t have to worry about war for a while now. Vietnam gets most of the Korean peninsula… except for the south part. Motion to call Korea “South Korea” for the rest of the game.

    one-sided peace deals
    Vietnam’s main specialty
    At least ten cities
    Australia not having open borders with Vietnam is huge here, effectively entirely crippling and immortalizing Seoul up north and forcing his mediocre navy down south. Vietnam, how did you do it? How did you take an entire Buccaneer amount of land in a one-sided trade deal? Teach me your methods.

    Brazil loses troops
    Now this could have meant something
    But Inuit dumb
    This seems to be the holding point for now. Brazil is overstretched on this front and they do not have significant enough air superiority for this to mean more than a few city flips. Inuit also are bringing out their most feared unit. Artillery.

    The Inuit quickly try to get their troops to the interior, but in doing so leave their coastal cities unprotected. Look for Montreal and Vancouver to fall soon. Vancouver being on the east coast is triggering me right now.

    Brazil killed them all
    These mountains are likely to be a meat grinder as man versus machine here and the only victor is the bloodthirstiness stat at the end of the part. Let us all celebrate the senseless death. In more positive news. Brazil has almost fully formed the former empire of their once ally Blackfoot.

    Excuse me for the hockey jokes, but Winnipeg is the latest city to fall to the Brazilian horde. Look for more cities to fall as Brazilian troops teleport and paradrop behind the Inuit troops. Nothing personnel, Ekeuhnick.

    Either Inuit troops are retreating and letting Brazil push north unimpeded, or Brazil is simply slaughtering them. I’m inclined to believe the first one, in which case: Ekeuhnick, this isn’t Russia. You can’t raze your own cities and hope the harsh winter will kill Brazilian troops. It doesn’t work that way.

    Can’t fit it in a haiku
    Zero out of ten.
    Brazil keeps on hitting about their belts. I would say that this is exceptional, but this is just normal business for Brazil. When they were fighting in wars, Brazil were building units. When they were nuking their neighbours into irrelevance, Brazil built units. When they wasted their days being diplomatic with Blackfoot, they cultivated even more units. And now that the world is on fire and Brazilians are at Inuit gate, you have the audacity to come to Pedro for forgiveness?

    Huehuehuehuehue
    I could see an Inuit pushback in this region, but it would ultimately be a big mistake for the Inuit as Brazil continues to jump behind Inuit lines. Vancouver is at low enough health that if Brazil can get a melee unit nearby it’s gone. Those submarines in the coast aren’t helping the Inuit, either.

    The war is chaotic all around. Remember the Korean denouncement of Australia; yeah that might be the worst decision in the history of everything CBR. There is more Australia fighting units here than there are people who hate Australia. That’s a lot of units.

    Why can’t the Blackfoot settle
    Cities with real names
    T-This has to be the end right? This has to be the end to oppression. This has to be end of Brazilian dominance. I’ll pull a quote from Hamilton to aid us in the upcoming battles.
    “Scratch that; this is not a moment, it’s the movement. Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went? Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand. We roll like Moses, claimin’ our promised land.  If they win their independence. Does that guarantee freedom for their descendants. Or will the blood be shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants.”
