      We begin with a game-changing development in Sri Lanka, as the vital
      Statue of Zeus wonder is constructed by Parakramabahu I in the shadow of Sri Pada,
      granting the owner‘s units a 15% combat bonus when attacking cities. Can Sri Lanka
      put it to use against their enemies? It seems they‘ll have to for now, as any
      prospective conquerers would have to embark their forces and take massive casualties
      to seize the island city.

      Our two Australian civs seem to be getting along without any border conflicts
      so far, but as the Kimberley settle counter-clockwise along the Australian coast,
      Jandamarra and Henry Parkes seem fated to one day confront each other under the
      shadow of Uluru in the sea of red that is the Outback.

      The One True Faith™ is established in Juarez, Mexico. With none of their
      immediate neighbors even having a Pantheon, it seems likely to become the dominant
      religion on the continent. Amen, hallelujah, peanut butter. Meanwhile, Texas is
      quickly filling in the gaps between their sprawled-out cities.

      As the sun rises on the year 3280 BC, Southeast Asian geopolitics are
      complicated as ever. On the religious front, a man named Buddha seeks to foster
      peace and enlightenment in the region by spreading his teachings to the citizens
      of the Burmese capital.

      At the same time on the other side of the planet, Muhammad and his Ayyubid
      followers establish Cairo as the Holy City of Islam. Only 8 tiles away from the
      Holy City of Judaism and split in the middle by the sacred Mt. Sinai, one can
      only hope both faiths value tolerance and won‘t seek to annihilate one another...
      who am I kidding, we want BLOOD!

      With precious new holdings in Crimea and Anatolia and nary the military
      to defend, let alone expand upon these acquisitions, Byzantium may quickly become
      the prime target for both European AND Middle Eastern warmongers. Also worth noting
      is the Armenian expansion into Anatolia, and the massive Spartan army around Messene.

      "Tibet, finally prepared to found a Religion, realizes Buddhism was taken
      by the Burmese only 2 turns before. “Well, screw Burma”, the Dalai Lama proclaims.
      “We‘ll make our own Buddhism, with yak and hookers!” Lhasa is now strangely the
      holy city of Akatt-u, which is apparently the religion of the Indus River Valley
      civilization. More notably, it is also the very first religion listed in alphabetical
      order. Regardless, this is an exciting development for Tibet fans, as their Unique
      Ability and Unique Building revolve around founding and spreading a religion.\n

      and Mountains worked by the city the Chorten is built in and Great Works stored
      within the Chorten generate points that work towards upgrading the Chorten, eventually

      his dreams, defiantly plops his settler 2 tiles south of Gyantse."

      A cold wind blows through the Blackfoot capital as the Inuit steadily
      march southward, founding Qamani‘tuaq a snowball‘s throw away from Crowfoot‘s

    narration:
      With nowhere else to go, the Blackfoot claim fertile land in the Great
      Basin and California, blocking a Sioux settler at the last second. Mexico expands
      into the Mojave with Veracruz, pretty much blocking off any other civs with Californian
      dreams.

      Texas is going hog-wild with Settlers, sending one unescorted up the
      mighty Missouri River, right towards the edges of Sioux land. Lincoln appears
      to have similar intentions, doing much the same a little to the East.

      An Irish Scout (!!!) and a Texan Warrior greet Buccaneer settlers to
      Florida with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Henry Morgan currently has no cities
      on the North American mainland apart from their Panama Canal, and this settle
      could change the whole game for them, opening the door on potential American or
      Texan campaigns.

    narration:
      In South America, much of Tierra Del Fuego remains unclaimed as both
      Chile and Argentina produce settlers in hopes of changing that. Chile founds La
      Serena on Eva Peron‘s back door, and another settler is concieved in Concepción.
      2 rival Argentinian settlers seem ready to go on the other side of the peninsula.

      On Florida‘s Gulf Coast, the pirate stronghold of Petit-Goave is established;
      a wretched hive of scum and villainy where a handful of jarred Texans and starry-eyed
      Irishmen live in the twilight amongst the hardest criminals and mercenaries of
      the Caribbean. Also, holy crap, look at that Mayan army! The calendar marks a
      very bad day that is fast-approaching for someone in the region.

    narration:
      Texas brazenly settles Corpus Christi right in Sitting Bull‘s neighborhood,
      and America founds Baltimore right across Lake Michigan from Toronto. Sam Houston
      has a fair army, but it‘s spread too thin to effectively defend against a coordinated
      invasion. That‘s still one-up on Lincoln, who barely has an army at all, and would
      be easy pickins for a bloodthirsty Canadian or Sioux conquerer.

      Every major African player has a bunch of Settlers on the move, scrambling
      to draw the absolutely insane borders that will drive future generations of cartographers
      to tears. Ethiopia forward settles Kongo, but Kongo still sends their own settler
      beyond that city towards Ethiopia‘s heartland. Several more Settlers pop out of
      cities on all sides.

      The Ayyubids expand into the hostile Western deserts, and Arabia seeks
      to fill in their peninsula at their own pace. A Finnish Scout seems either very

    narration:
      Napoleonic and Nazi German forces whittle down the walls of Neapolis
      one brick at a time, surrounding 3 brave Roman Archers on all sides, forced by
      the odds and by the Emperor to keep shooting until they run out of arrows or are
      struck down. How long they hold out against the storm determines if they will
      be remembered as fearless heroes of the Empire or inept cowards who failed the
      glory of Rome.

      as Vanilla, but while alone, receives the “Molon Labe” promo, which provides +20%
      Defense, while next to friendly units, receives the “Add a step forward” promo,
      which provides +20% Attack.\n \nI don‘t think any of Sparta‘s neighbors are eager
      to Molon Labe any time soon, so Sparta will likely have to go on the offense to
      test their warriors‘ merit."

      Attila, Timur, and Kuchum Khan drunkenly huddle around one another and

      cracks of Poland and Byzantium.\n \nOn another note, I absolutely love any slides
      that show the Russian wastes like this. There‘s always so many scouts from so

      Korea‘s Northern colonies of Jeonju and Daegu have grown exponentially
      since we last saw them, and now they have actual military units protecting them
      from hypothetical Red Chinese aggression. Japan settles Nagoya on the southernmost

      At around the same time Sparta got their Hoplites, Persia begins producing
      Immortals. Unfortunately, if we want to see a rematch, one or both of them will

      Part 2 have reached their final destinations, with Norway founding Eidsvoll and
      Tromso north of Sweden, and Sweden settling Uppsala and Turku right in Norway
      and Finland‘s respective [insert euphamism here]s. More importantly, the one /r/civbattleroyale
      was too eager to dub the “Pussycat of the North”, Gustavus Adolphus, is sharpening

      Sibir seems just as happy to turtle as the Yakuts are, but Afghanistan
      and Tibet are moving to entirely block them off from the Gobi Desert. In the North,
      2 Chinese settlers are escorted to Siberia. One can only make assumptions about

      Saladin settles Alexandria on the North African coast, just a little
      too close to Sparta for anyone‘s comfort. Sparta‘s borders still block the Ayyubids

      Sweden secures Eidsvoll just as the tides turn and Norway gains the military
      edge. Seeing this, Gustavus hastily makes peace, forgoing the worthless arctic
      city of Tromso for another day. The “Housecat of the North” (has earned a better
      name, but still isn‘t quite a Lion yet) must rest and repair his army before getting
      ahead of himself. There‘s also still plenty of room for either player to settle
      between them, meaning future wars could be much faster and more intense.

      "Just across the Arctic Circle from the battlegrounds of Scandinavia,
      the Inuit expand east through Nunavut by founding Niaqunnguut. Blackfoot and Sitting
      Bull put their cards on the table by founding their own cities in the Canadian
      tundra. Tsuutina for the Blackfoot, just north of the Sioux tribes of Itazipcho
      and Sihasapa. Fun fact about that last one: Sihásapa is the Lakota word for “Blackfoot”,
      whereas Siksiká has the same meaning in the Blackfoot language. As a result, the
      Sihásapa have the same English name as the Blackfoot Confederacy, and the nations
      are sometimes confused with one another."

      Chile wins the race to Tierra Del Fuego with the settling of Valdivia,
      though a large space still remains mysteriously unclaimed between it and Argentina.
      What happened to the Argentinian settlers? I see one in the mountains Southwest
      of Rio, but the other seems to have... vanished.

      An Australian Cargo Ship travels the Gold Coast, seemingly promoting
      peace between the Australians and Aborigines, but one must remember that Australia
      gets big bonuses from naval trade routes, so this move may be more self-centered
      than it would appear. Shocked by the Maori takeover of Tasmania, at least 3 Australian
      Settlers are being escorted around, in a scramble to nab other fertile and strategic
      city locations.

      Geez, look at Tibet and their insanely... vertical borders. They settled
      Bamda, Nagchuka, and Chamdo on the edges of the inhospitable Gobi, strategically
      blocking off Sibir, Afghan, and potentially, Mongol and Chinese expansions. But
      does Tibet have the army to back up fortitude of this level? Songstan Gampo certainly
      isn‘t making any friends this way.

      With the land between Chonqing and Tianjin unclaimed by Top Dog Mao for
      quite a long time, both Korea and Vietnam have settlers in the area looking to
      snag new lands for themselves. Worth noting is that while populous, the core Chinese
      cities of Beijing and Shanghai seem to have stagnated all this time. In the Ryukyus,
      Rizal claims Okinawa for the Philippines, using Taiwan as a base of operations.
      Meiji can‘t do anything about it right now even if he wants to, because he simply
      doesn‘t have the navy for the job.

      The Black Circle is slowly coming to fruition in the Caribbean, with

      The gaps are quickly closing in North America, and any major expansion
      in the heartland will be drawn by the sword, not the pen. Obviously, because I
      don‘t think pens were invented by 3010 BC. Anyhow, take a look at the new Canadian
      city of Saint John, and all those Sioux and Blackfoot settlers running around
      like they own the place, because right now, they quite frankly do. Texas would
      rather focus on developing their lands than rapidly expanding their military.

      The bloody fray in West Africa seems more of a bloody stalemate at this
      point in time, with Malian and Ashanti units smacking into one another in the

      from hell. Kilimanjaro remains INFURIATINGLY untouched in the East.

      Horrific tales of man-eating Bunyips, man-eating Yowies, and various
      other man-eating wildlife of all sizes and varieties work perfectly to keep almost
      all Kimberley and Australian settlers far, far away from the hellish Outback.
      A competition is now underway to colonize, actual quote from Henry Parkes, “literally
      any island other than this fucking crazy prison, like the other day, I saw a spider
      the size of a dinner plate run across the floor of the palace and under my bathroom
      door, I‘ve had to hold it in for like 2 days now”. The ring of viable coastal
      cities is closed in the North by Darwin. The Maori also throw their hat into the
      ring, sending a lone settler out into the mighty Pacific. One begins to wonder
      why TPang bothered hiding the Babylonian Submarine in Antarctica instead of just
      dropping it on top of Uluru.
