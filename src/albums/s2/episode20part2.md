  narration: "<p>Welcome back to the Civ Battle Royale Xtra, episode 20.3. I’m still BloodyAltima, and I’m still narrating, so without further ado, let’s get back to the synthetic warcrimes we left off on. </p>"

  scene_title: "Putting on the Blitz"

  narration: "<p>We return to the bombing of Georgia. </p><p></p><p>Tamar sat in her throne room, nursing a monster of a headache. Either the bombers needed to give up, or their masters needed to conquer Tblisi, and frankly, she didn’t care which anymore.</p><p></p><p>Uzbek air wings watched the bombing, conducting recon exercises to practice for future wars against both of the Russians. Some forty frames sat in waiting for just such an occasion.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the far off land of Swedes, the war of Yuans found an unexpected front, as two Northern Parajumpers assaulted a Hetu Alalan Rifle Division entrenched in an Uzbek citadel. The sparse Uzbek and German soldiers took bets as to how long it would take the City-State’s infantry to die.</p>"

  scene_title: "Konigsberg: Forlorn Hope"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>The misfired war against the USSR filled many Uzbeks with confidence; while the USSR may have better tech, it seemed that incompetence at war was just a Russian fixture, red or white. If and when hostilities began again, surely Uzbek numbers would turn the tide again.</p><p></p><p>This confidence did not spread to the troops stationed in Konigsberg. There were more Northern Yuan troops nearby than allied reinforcements. Most of their easily accessed reserves were depleted in the fighting. Sure, there were the Peace Corps and the Oceanic Division, but they weren’t exactly in position to just airlift to the front. There just weren’t enough numbers to turn the tide again.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Geneseric and Awolowo were frequent drinking buddies, a frequency that seemed to extend to their troops, who spent time in each others lands on shore leave. Vandal marines would hang out with the handlers of Nigerian velociraptors and pet the little murder turkeys, exchange trinkets for shed raptor feathers.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Awolowo called for the systemic blockading and embargoed of the incompetent White Russians, for in a fascistic world defined by war, those who fail boringly deserve the time (and goods) of no-one. Meanwhile, Wilhelm made a doomed play to try and stop defining the world by fascism and violence.</p><p></p><p>And in the middle of the negotiations, Rio declared that it would snuff the flame of freedom out for once and for all.</p>"

  narration: "<p>It should have been so simple. March a few troops into the pathetic Palmarene city-state. They had basically nothing for a military. If the Gauls had brought breakthrough forces, they’d be dead now. But there was one problem: Marajoara. They owned every approach to the city. To kill Quilombo for once and for all, you needed P’kuee’s approval. Vercingetorix had it. Rosilio did not.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A missive came back to Vercingetorix. After reading it, he ordered everyone but his grand admiral to leave his office. The dress-down was not loud enough to echo throughout the palace, but it’s hate was felt by everyone who saw the former admiral afterwards. Vercingetorix would later pen a letter back to Zumbi: “We have wasted enough time with you. The war is over.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kristjan of Iceland sent a letter to Tuskaloosa. “Do you remember when you denied my people the chance to rise, to excel? When you damned us to an irrelevant icy hell? We do. It is time we repaid the favor.” </p><p></p><p>Thanadalfeur laughed when the news broke. “Good luck, kiddo.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>On the open seas of Chola, remnants of the Paraguayan fleet ambushed a wandering Marajoaran mechanized artillery unit in transit. “How well do your guns work on the seas, bastards!” shouted one captain as his cannons tore into the transports.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Karimov looked out to his legions. “This time, we shall not wait for them to come to us!” The 13th, 235th, and 267th Powered Armor Divisions readied their weapons. “We shall march into Moscow, raw force of Uzbek manpower sweeping aside the hollow Russian army!” Three Vertol wings readied for takeoff. “Today, we seize the initiative!” The missile left its silo. “Today, Uzbekistan wins!”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Lenin was ready for this, though the initial glance may not show it. Already, a large mechanized force marched for Konigsberg, ready to take back the city. Uzbek air command did not expect this surge, having spent most of its effort bombing city defenses into oblivion.</p>"

  scene_title: "The End of Science"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>“Welcome to the end of science!” boomed a voice over the intercom, as the Kulin representative greeted the new arrivals. “Here at the International Association of Looking Busy, we’re busily researching new ways to justify our continued employment to the literal fascists who we had previously been researching under so they don’t just liquidate us. We look forward to the new and exciting methods of Looking Busy.”</p>"

  scene_title: "Initiative Lost"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lenin’s generals had retaken the initiative. Power Armor was a great leg up in infantry technologies, a few hundred years ago. Now that it was Powered Infantry against Battlesuits and GDRs, it was more akin to fighting automatic rifles with old bolt actions, to say nothing of the Nexi in the air.</p>"

  scene_title: "I’m Sure I’ll Find Another Konigsberg Pun Later"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nowhere was this clearer than Konigsberg. All that was left to defend the city by land was a single Powered Armor division. It was doomed to fall to the USSR.</p>"

  scene_title: "Back on the Chopping Block"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Russian forces rushed into the Uzbek border once more. This time, local forces were already exhausted. The Uzbeks could maybe retake the fallen cities with reinforcements, but they’d need to get them there first. And they’d never have the chance.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Backfire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Karimov stared at the report, befuddled. “We were supposed to win.” They had lost Konigsberg, Nicopsia, Sukhumi. Certainly, not a huge loss; certainly, a terrible look for a war they had started in the first place. It was clear- numbers alone could not suffice against a prepared foe.</p><p></p><p>And all the while, Tbilisi still burned.</p>"

  scene_title: "Nonsense Borders"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Dene population in the Pacific Northwest had cause for concern. The Rockies may be a wall, but the Rio forces stretched for miles, while Thanaldenfeur had not seen fit to garrison any forces along her very wide borders. Even Malacca had more units in theater, and they were doomed just to be a cushion should hostilities break out with Rio.</p>"

  scene_title: "If At First You Don’t Succeed..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Thinking on it, Thanaldenfeur decided that if the blood Icelanders were willing to put their hat in the ring, she could at least try again to finish her old foe. Having an actual naval force built up in theater couldn’t hurt.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "...Try, Try Again."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Persistence proved itself a virtue. Tanks rolled through Bottle Creek. The Mississippi were finally dead. Tuskaloosa was nowhere to see, someone had already ferried him out.</p><p></p><p>Tuskaloosa felt no self-pity or shame on his way out. He had been a prominent figure in North America. He handed Roslio his first humiliation so long ago. Were it not for Rio’s impossibly defensible cities, the Mississippi would likely have gone on to hold a sizable control over the continent. They fought, they tried, and they lost, but they lost from a position so many never reached. No-one has ever feared Finland, but once, so long ago now, they feared Mississippi. He descended into the submarine, head held high. </p>"

  narration: "<p>While the Marajoaran fleet was nothing to sneeze at, the Vandals had so many more ships. If and when it came to war, it would be a bloodbath, and an annoying one for how similar their flag colors are.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Once more did Ranjit Singh declare upon Raja Raja. Once more would their forces smash into each other. Once more, would the subcontinental peninsula be stained with blood.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Further east, Punjab had not properly readied its forces, leaving Chola an ideal position to push back in.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bolt From the Blue"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Even as sparse as Punjabi forces were, every inch of the Cholan coast was a battleground. Here and there, a city still fell.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Blood in All Directions"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The former Bhutan stronghold of Thimpu found itself a battleground once more. As cut out from supply lines as they were, the defenders still held out hope in the city’s near-mythical reputation for holding out against Punjab.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Total Mess"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kublai Khan received another declaration of war. This time, from P’kuee of the Marajoara. “Get in line,” he told the messenger.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Kulin/Malaccan front settled in an uneasy quiet. Malacca had far more boats on scene, with most of the nearby Kulin forces being embarked land combat divisions, but what few Kulin naval frames were present were much more modernized. Should it come to a fight, it would be a mess.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "All Along the Line"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Punjabi forces took more cities along the front. Seeing this slaughter, Raja Raja sent two messages: one, an order for more Nexi production to help stem the tide. The other, a declaration of war upon Kublai Khan, for luck.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Less Lines than Scribbles"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Most wars are messier than wargames and movies make them out to be. Commandos behind the established lines, random stragglers fighting in long-lost territories, battle lines are rarely as clear as “we have this part, they have that part.” Several Nexi rampaged within Punjabi borders while rest of the front developed broadly in Punjab’s favor.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Naval Assault"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>A large Cholan naval force rallied, ready to try and raise hell in the west, where a weak Punjabi naval force stood defender over a wide front. Still, sent in detail as they had been, they were doomed to defeat even if their foes counted an ironclad from the steam age among them.</p>"

  scene_title: "Continued Attrition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Several cities fell to Punjab assault, as Cholan forces were worn down by attrition.</p>"

  scene_title: "A Portent"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yuan General Guo Kan sat in his transport, watching the Kulin boats come and go. While their proper naval forces were lacking, he still found himself favoring them if it came to a fight against the Mapuche- for while they had an entire Australia to pull new boats from, the Mapuche would have a harder time reinforcing losses.</p>"

  scene_title: "Resurgence"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>A rush of reinforcements pushed Cholan forces into Thakhek. Local Punjab forces were badly outnumbered, an unexpected result for their leaders.</p>"

  scene_title: "Rocket’s Glare"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Two bloody blitzes of wars had done a number on the Uzbek infantry. Most of their surprisingly thin military forces were rocket artillery divisions, long out of date in an age of mechanized artillery.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, peace bloomed between Chola and Punjab once more.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Let the Flame Burn"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Historians debate if Tamar was driven to madness, rage, or apathy by the decades of bombing. What none debate is that her decision to follow the same path as Zumbi, as Liliʻuokalani, as Saint Stephen, was certainly inspired.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Win Some, Lose Some"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>The ultimate result of the war was mostly that Chola was pushed south. They had gained a city in Southeast Asia, a city on the Peninsula, but lost two in former Bhutan and one on the Eastern coast of India. The Nexus Resurgence had done a lot to stem the losses, but there were still losses.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Every now and then, the Peacekeeper stuck in Hetu Ala would cycle to a new one. Today, it was a Kulin AA corp. It ultimately didn’t matter who it was- the Glass Stronghold would stand as long as anyone was there.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Wilhelm called on his fellow leaders to embargo those weak freedom-loving Quilombans, as Hong Xiquan called on his fellow leaders to please stop embargoing him. It had been so long since he had done anything to deserve it, really.</p>"

  scene_title: "Let the Ruinous War Begin"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Two declarations of war arrived at Lautero’s desk. The first, he saw and mostly laughed off. Rio Grande was unlikely to pose much of a threat. Sure, he’d never make any actual gains against their citadels of adamantium, but they were too far to really threaten him. The other made his blood turn cold. The Kulin were back for blood.</p>"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: "Vanguard Outfit"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>While there was admittedly a large Rio armored column near enough by, that was not the problem Lautero was most concerned with. That problem was the large garrison of Lima, large and close enough to be a potential problem in the imminent future.</p>"
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: "First Blows"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>Airpower had already brought most of the western cities defenses low, and skirmishes began in the northernmost cities against the odd advance unit, most of whom had been “peacekeeping” in Marajoaran territory.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Oceans Run Red"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lautero and his admirals all knew that long-term, they could not hold the seas, not against the raw numbers in the Kulin navy. Any city they took would only be a holding action to keep the Kulin further from Puren, the capital. Even so, that was their best shot, and so the navy went to fight.</p>"
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: "Holy Lands Know the Taste"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mobuto looked at the map, saw a stretch of the Arabian peninsula not owned by an actual power, and decided to to take it himself before that changed. Jerusalem was to fall, as soon as possible. As its garrison was mostly Biscillian tanks, this didn’t seem much of a problem in the grand scheme of things, barring the inevitability of naval assets reconquering the city a few times.</p>"
- scene_number: 45
  scene_title: "Once More Unto the Breach"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>Wilhelm joined his cabinet of generals in the board room. “Gentlemen, that was an excellent campaign against the Swedish remnant.” The generals nodded. “Truly one of our quickest wins,” a general replied. </p><p></p><p>“We need to capitalize on this momentum,” Wilhelm began. One of the generals suddenly realized where this was going, and stifled a scream. “We need to get back into the field. Now, we could try to navigate some sort of open borders with either the USSR or Uzbekistan, but those guys are fascist and suck respectively. No, we need to go for someone closer to home. Someone we have more experience fighting.” Another general blanched. “Gentleman, it is time to invade the Twin Sicilies again, alongside fellow communists, Zaire!”</p>"

  scene_title: "Aren’t You Needed Elsewhere?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Mapuche Eastern Fleet sat idle, but not quiet. They knew they were needed out west, but getting there would be a nightmare, so instead they mostly ran logistics and readied in case the Vandals or (in the worst case) Marajoara joined in against them, watching as Two Sicilies boats fought the random boats of other civs.</p>"

  scene_title: "Antarctic Warfare"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the southernmost edge of the Cylinder itself, Mapuche and Kulin fleets fought over the Antarctic islands. The Kulin took the first blow, seizing Lof Ta, but the fighting was far from over, as what elements of the Western Fleet could do so began to trickle in.</p>"

  scene_title: "First Landfall"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>The first core city to fall was Futra Kura, although it would not stay in Barak’s hands for long. The push was unsupported, and the seas still contested. It was still an ill omen for the Mapuche.</p>"
- scene_number: 49
  scene_title: "Blood on Ice"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene49.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kulin forces continued to bear down on the frozen cities, and the defenders continued to hold as best they could, for once those cities fell, all the heat would fall on the peninsular heartland cities.</p>"

  scene_title: "Italian Hills, Man"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene50.jpg
  narration: "<p>The hills of Italy and the peacekeepers within, as normal, made progress a slog for the Germans. Wilhelm’s hope was that the raw gap in troop quality would make the difference. The generals thought it a faint hope, but Wilhelm was willing to take the gamble.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene51.jpg
  narration: "<p>When Puren fell for the first time, Lautero’s generals tried to convince him to pull back to a bunker out east. After he finished chewing those generals out in private, he opened with a public declaration to return to Puren, in person. “We will retake Puren. And they’ll take it back again. And we’ll repeat this cycle again and again, but I promise you all: I will keep coming back, no matter how many times it takes, and I’ll still be there in the end.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zairepower had brought Jerusalem’s defences to the brink, but no troops were in theater to press the advantage for now. The Bisclian troops joked about Wilhelm being closer to conquering the capital than Zaire was to taking them. It wasn’t the kind of joke anyone actually intended to laugh at.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Lautero kept his promise for the first time of many.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The conquest of the coastal core finally began in earnest, with tentative land reinforcements arriving to help secure the beachhead. Mapuche forces were clearly waning, but they still had plenty of fight left in them, as they retook Puren before long.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene55.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lautero looked across the broken city of Puren. Barely six thousand still lived here now, most having died in or fled from the fighting. Everywhere he went, he found corpses left unburied. There was just too much fighting to do. He knew things were worse in Futra Kura, and he knew it would only get worse. He prayed he’d at least be able to keep it from spreading.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Raiders from Lima managed to take Temu Ko while the Mapuche fought to keep their main core. This sent alarm bells among the cabinet- not only would it be hell retaking the city given the border situation, that opened up a new front for the Kulin to send ground troops.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode20-part2-scene57.jpg
  narration: "<p>Taiping and the Northern Yuan stood at peace, two armies far out of date, left behind in the press of science. Hong Xiuquan knew if it came to it, they’d lose horribly. Quantity, as some Soviet general had said, had a quality of its own, and the Northern Yuan certainly had quantity. Higher than they could mentally fathom as a number, at that.</p><p></p><p>Lautero took in the barrage of eight declarations of war, skimmed the list, noticed that neither the Vandals nor Marajoara were among them, and threw them all in the trash. Thomas Sankara and Wangchuck weren’t his biggest problem at the moment.</p>"
