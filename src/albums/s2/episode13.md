  narration: "<p>Hi! I’ve been a fan of AI games ever since the first Battle Royale, but this is only the second time I’ve had the opportunity to narrate it! I have about 10,000 hours on Civ 3, so the hexagons are a bit of a mind-bender, but with the seventeen spreadsheets narrators get access to, I should be okay. Last part was pretty exciting, with the Ptolemies cut in half by a newly-aggressive Nigeria; Marajoara reducing Gran Colombia to a smattering of cities; Chola suddenly becoming a decent naval civ on the doorstep of the most-decent-est naval civ, Malacca; Yuan being carved up; and the Vandals establishing a sizeable North American presence. What will happen this episode? Stay tuned, and find out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Come on - you don’t know who Vihreaa is? You’ve never heard of a map? You don’t even like Civ? That’s three questions that are unrealistic to even consider in the submarine. Seeing these maps is the only way to understand what the big picture is, and this is what is up:</p><p>There’s some superpowers forming, some swapping round in the middle, and a well-formed lower tier of civs that we hold no hope for. There’s excitement in every corner of the map (except Australia, sorry).</p>"

  scene_title: "Blue and gold is the colour of a sea-based champion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr12-scene54.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’m going to talk about a Civ that deserves to be at the top. They’ve taken on two front-runners on different sides of their empire despite a weak land army, they have a great colour scheme, and they’re based in Asia. Those of you yelling out Bhutan - thank you - but Malacca is the number one, both in my heart and in the Power Rankers’ view. I honestly don’t think it’s possible to beat Malacca, though there are a couple of rising superpowers that we’ll be discussing in this episode that, given five or ten parts, might seek to topple Malacca.</p>"

  scene_title: "One Yuan to Rule Them All"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We kick off the episode with the remnants of Yuan. Their Sao, the galleass replacement, is preventing Taiping from pushing north towards Chengdu, so it looks like Northern Yuan will gain a valuable naval port soon. Northern Yuan have both UUs out. We’ve met the Huihui Pao before, a siege unit, but I think the Chongzu is new to our screens. It is a lancer replacement with no penalty attacking cities - pretty useful at this stage of the game.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Northern Yuan’s unique abilities, their UA is pretty strong too, with an extra tile’s movement for units trained in captured cities - of which they have a lot on screen.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Swaanendael is under assault from… lots of people. There’s Dene, Vandal, Tahitian, and Ananguan troops within the borders, with Olmec and Jamaican troops nearby. Dutch Caribbean prospects are looking as thin as the Dutch eastern seaboard.</p><p></p><p>Just the previous turn Rio Grande declared war on New Netherlands, moving their Gulf Navy eastwards. They are part of a big coalition with a wide range of civs, but most are continents away. Rio Grande are who count in this image, and they have a great chance at taking this big Caribbean city.</p>"

  scene_title: "Vandal Savage, occasional conqueror"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here, too - in the far north - Dutch lands are now occupied by Vandals, seemingly doing anything to escape the barren heat of their homeland.</p><p></p><p>Note Iceland, the rocky refuge on the top of the world, with a carpet - out-of-date - but a carpet nonetheless. Iceland are still at war with Mississippi, who are not looking particularly strong this far away from the swampy climes they prefer. Even after the invasion from Rio Grande, Mississippi still command a big empire and are showing some attempt to project that.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Jong Admiral gazes over his armada. He had heard once of a mighty ruler who built so many ships they could walk from port to port. Well, Adjongmiral had accomplished that, and now was in the process of tacking on strips of iron to the sides of the boat to prevent wear and tear as the boats rock gently side-by-side. </p><p></p><p>Last part saw a resurgent Chola flex their navy, and a war between the Gold-and-Blue and Gold-and-Black is surely coming to see who takes the medal. Pakse you would think would fall first, but Malacca have no land army to speak of. Even the weakened Laos have enough troops to do something with, though getting from Sai Gon to the contiguous Laosian empire is impossible thanks to the citadel south of Ha Noi.</p>"

  scene_title: "Maracaib-Oh-No"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Gran Colombia - reduced to simply ‘Colombia’ last part and nowadays referred to as Poco Colombia, is on its last legs in the old capital of the eliminated Peru-Bolivia. Marajoaran troops are not flooding in, but the two field guns are taking enough pot shots to deal damage.</p>"

  scene_title: "Getting DEIC-ey"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hawaii and the Dutch East India Company have both lost their homelands (mostly) and now exist in a space enclosed by two major powers, who have no interest in them except like how a young boy might watch a terrarium in a science lab. Hilo looks like it has the production to make a navy to invade, should the Hawaiians finish their 13-episode-long nap any time soon.</p><p></p><p>Even here Malacca look scary, but the Kulin have Gatling Guns, who can rip apart a basic army with ease.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Deciding Who Gets Eaten Last"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Last episode, Tongva and Chinook began their war in earnest, with the fall of Naayxoxar a critical early step. Yet that might have been a misstep, as Tongvan navies besiege Chinook, the Chinook capital. Naayxoxar will flip, and the Chinook army is larged ranged.</p><p></p><p>The Chukchi have built their Ice Fleet to rival anything in folklore. Off-White Walkers patrol the southern border, though open borders means Chinook troops pass freely from their northernmost outposts to the battle below.</p>"

  scene_title: "A mountain kingdom/Himalayan fortresses/Hard to conquer these"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>A bhrave Bhutanese Great General bhesieges the Viet city of Luang Prabang. The plucky mountain kingdom holds on, surprisingly strongly, and an inland city with no land route from the Cholan cores is a good choice to take, if Bhutan musters the right troops at the right time. You can just about see a Dzong up above Punakha, generating culture, faith, and acting as a fort for any units placed there. </p><p></p><p>As the person who wrote the sixty-strong city names list for Bhutan, I really hope they manage to raze the entirety of Asia and resettle them with gusto.</p>"

  scene_title: "Transoceanic adventures"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malaccan Jongs attack Baya California, but the vast might of the navy is yet to arrive. It’s speculative invading, but a frightening prospect if the number one civ transcends the ocean and establishes a core on another continent. Tongva are weak down here and still dealing with Chinook up north, so the masses of galleasses pass between the two battlefields, waving despondently to their friends heading in the other direction.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Naval-gazing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>There’s a glaring mistake in this picture. Can you spot it? That’s right, the Two Sicilies navy is looking rather like One Sicilies as the patch of empty sea expands around Memphis. Frustratingly too, they have open borders with Blue Egypt, so-called for feeling blue after the powerful, technologically-advanced Nigerian army run rampant through their lands last part.</p><p></p><p>Yet for Two Sicilies’ naval might diminishing, they could still demolish any city in the vicinity. </p><p></p><p>Kurdish troops advance an inch in Jerusalem’s territories, and they take the rest of the day off to drink tea.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Trade war"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reunion, a colony from the Master Colonist Jan Coen, is overrun by Cholan ships. Militarily useless, there are some good trade routes available here, plying the Southern Ocean between West Kulin and Lesotho. Two Sicilies would also pick something up with a well-timed declaration.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "And sao the invasion continues"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Northern Yuan get their first seaport with the fall of Chengdu. Mukden takes the smallest sliver of damage as Japanese troops push upwards. The Sao is unusual - for each that is trained, another two are spawned, and when any die, all die. It’s a cheap way to build a big navy and a quick way to lose all of it at the wrong moment.</p><p></p><p>We also see the Yuanese city of Hetu Ala protected somewhat by being inside Chukchian borders - this is a glitch it seems, but we’ll see.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Tongva push north"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tongva, now dealing with Malacca below, pull back from Chinook, with Naayxoxar yet to flip. </p><p></p><p>Across the ocean, Japan declare themselves the true upholders of Autocracy, adopting the warlike ideology in order to better pursue their dreams of uniting the Republic of Osaka and the Empire of Tokyo under one government.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Legacy of Arauco"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mapuchean troops utilise the Legacy of Arauco, pushing up through Paraguay without asking permission first. They’d best defend the Galapagos Islands soon, or Marajoara will run rampant down this coastline too.</p><p></p><p>Lima falls into the red, the field guns making light work of Lima’s walls.</p>"

  scene_title: "Tongva push north some more"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Finally, Naayxoxar flips back. You would think the armada of galleases could be a bit more present in assaulting Chinook, but they’re being held back in indecision. </p><p></p><p>Palmares peacekeepers litter Chinook lands, their neon green uniforms not exactly blending in with the dusty deserts of the region.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Painful peace"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Mapuche and Palmares made peace last turn, with the sudden loss of Arotirene and Subupira catapulting the troops some 5000 miles (8000 kilometres) away. It would be hard to defend if Marajoara looked southwards.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "The End of a Line"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lima falls! Gran Colombia is no more.</p><p>With the last musketman unlikely to quell the Marajoaran forces, it’s fair to say that Poco Colombia is now Muerto Colombia. They started poorly, losing their opening settler to a scout of all units, and being forward settled by a Jamaica initially ranked in last place. But, as a good civ does, they fight back, and they established a decent nation in South America, rivalling any other. Yet, somehow, they lost it all in just three episodes in an appalling example of How To Defend Good.</p><p></p>"

  scene_title: "Reunion reunited"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Reunion is reunited with the dominant naval force in the area. Chola are really leaning hard of this side of their game, perhaps because Punjab, the everpresent weight above their heads, have the better land army.</p><p></p><p>How do Chola win the season? Expansion is limited and anywhere with good production is under the grips of a big civ with a good land army. It’s a long way before they will challenge the top ten.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Seahorse Assault"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pontianak is very close to falling, giving Chola a very powerful grasp on Southeast Asia. Note the humorous Punjabi hex in the sea near Uraiyur, and imagine how the Cholan fishermen need to float over to a wet border guard before commencing their work every morning.</p><p></p><p>With the Viet cities still puppeted, there’s no army to speak of inland, which means a plucky Laos could make a gain or two.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pythagoras’ Greatest Work is a listicle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Thanks, Pythagoras. A lot of African cities make the top of the tourist boards’ boards for not being boring. Well, the reason is probably the lack of war in Africa. All these cities are peaceful and productive.</p>"

  scene_title: "First Congress of Berlin, 1955."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The First Congress of Berlin is underway. Not unsurprisingly the warmongering of Chola is on the agenda, with the Congress contemplating an embargo on the defiant civ. </p><p></p><p>If I remember correctly, the Congress is called once a civ has met every other civ. Imagine that journey that German explorers must have made, to have met people like the Olmecs, Anangu, or Bhutan. That’s a tale for another writer I’m sure.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Marajoara push into the lands just vacated by the Palmares. The Mapuche have just had a trick played on them - now Marajoara can take these cities, wiping out all gains, and potentially then push southwards through Tabocas.</p><p></p><p>This doesn’t leave Palmares anywhere to go, though. On every side they have someone tougher.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Disappointingly, Two Sicilies also has open borders with the Vandals, despite the excellent opportunity to expand out the Mediterranean and pick up an easy capital in Hippo Regius.</p><p></p><p>Onscreen, one of the last Ptolemian holdings in Africa is under fire from a rifleman and a cavalry unit, with three artillery units in range pushing the city in deep red with their coursing bombardments. There’s a modest naval force in the Red Sea but it’s unclear how often Thebai will be able to flip before it’s exhausted.</p><p></p><p></p>"

  scene_title: "Desperate measures"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The First Congress of Berlin conclude that Chola is in fact a danger to trade following its conquest of a key trading nation, and are summarily banned from trading.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the Sao can quickly cripple their owners, as the sinking of one has destroyed the other two. Two bleeding settlers paddle for their life in hope of escaping the Yuanese peninsula, but they head in the wrong direction and find themselves in dangerous waters.</p>"

  scene_title: "Bay of Zwijnendael"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>After a short while, Swaanendael falls into the hands of Rio Grande, lengthening their border with the Vandals even further. I think Rio Grande would do well out of a war with the Vandals, personally, as the beige Caribbean doesn’t hold any great show of military might. Heemstede would be a valuable city for Rio Grande, and Rotterdam would secure some degree of Atlantic access were it not inland. A Vaquero lurks near Rotterdam, but there’s no river to attack across to get a nice strength bonus.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Thebai is captured and Ptolemais is still without a scratch. That sums up the difference in approach between Zaire and Nigeria. </p><p></p><p>One artillery detachment moves eastwards to take pot shots at the Red Sea, hoping to clear a patch of water.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Georgia, always an outside shot in a game of Civ, lose Sukhumi to a cannon-heavy Uzbek army, with two Lancers fleeing with their tails between their legs. To have held off a once-contender for so long is impressive, though it’s clear Georgia are well-behind the tech curve at present. Who will own Tbilisi in ten episodes?

The Chukchi navy looks scary, even with this little glimpse, and even a Two Sicilies fan like myself thinks Chukchi might be a bit stronger than our European sea kings.</p><p></p><p>A voice in my ear says that Mapuche have fallen for the eyelash flutterings of Autocracy as another prominent civ declares their love for chaos through conflict.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Deep concern across the cylindrical community as Two Sicilies announces to the world the loss of some of their ships. It’s noted by a desperate Ptolemaic commander, who declares war on the Light Blues despite the rifleman near Kerakleopolis being the most powerful naval unit they have at present.</p><p></p><p>Alexandria takes damage from Nigerian machine guns and artillery, opening up the possibility that Two Sicilies nabs it first.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A slightly clearer shot of the Two Sicilies core reveals an emptiness that disturbs me. Where have all the troops gone? The Kosovan navy would do a lot of damage to Foggia! Germany, who we have yet to see much of so far, throw their lot in with the Ptolemies along with varied civs like Namibia, Punjab, and Spain. The massive German production may be at an era now where the Alps are no longer a good defensive structure, but we’ll soon see if Palermo is in danger.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode13-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vandals push into Burkinabe Western Sahara. This is an important war because the Vandals have no inland territory to speak of, being a largely ocean-going civ. A purely naval civ is quickly beaten, though, by anyone with a land army, and so serious land gains are needed for their sweet production bonus. A positive would be if Kidal falls, as the capital region could finally be connected by road to the Atlantic region of Vandal territory.</p>"

  narration: "<p>North Northern Yuan is under threat here. Some civs make good of the sparse Siberian landscape (see Yakutia, Sibir), but only a few can truly triumph from this position. If either side made good gains, it bodes well for the future. As it happens, All-Russia look stronger, still, with Ikh Khuree and Erdene Zuu suffering damage and the attractive lakeside cities of Shangdu and Ulanhad also a possibility.</p>"
