    narration: "<p>Hello ladies, gentlemen, non-binaries, and all those in between to our 24th episode of the CBRX 2! I have the privileged honor of narrating this wonderful and momentous episode for all of your enjoyment. I must warn you, there will be joy, there will be heartbreak, there will be betrayal, but that’s all part of the package when we all come here every other week to watch AI’s try to conquer the planet!</p>"

    narration: "<p>It’s been quite an honor to have the maps I make each week become a mainstay for every album in the CBR, and as usual, I have provided the map for last episode. We see the growing and waning power of all the states across the cylinder, and this episode may not see all of the civs here survive to the next map.</p>"

    narration: "<p>A piece of OC from this week is brought to us from u/Autisticnotweird, giving us a glimpse into what a nightmare scenario of a royale could look like? Who among the worst would come out as the best?</p>"

    scene_title: "You **want** to become a donor"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene04.jpg
    narration: "<p>Huge thanks to our wonderful donors for helping to keep this project alive. It’s very likely that we would not be able to be where we are today without your help! </p><p>For anyone even vaguely intrigued with becoming a Ko-Fi contributor, donors on the website gain access to test runs of the CBRX2 in cycle 2, and from what I’ve heard some of them are pretty crazy.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr23-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Marajoara retains their first place position this episode, as the PRs generally have a consensus that their dominance over the entirety of South America puts them ahead of the pack. While they may have a lead though, there are many civs right on their tail that are just dying to take the top spot from them.</p>"

    scene_title: "Gods and Kings"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>Our first content slide of the episode brings us to the Government Overview screen, showing us the types of governments all of the different civs in the cylinder have. I’m not sure as to the differences between all of the government types, but there is certainly a wide spread, with republics, monarchies, tribes, and more just on this slide.</p>"
  - scene_number: 07
    scene_title: "Government 101"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene07.jpg
    narration: "<p>This slide shows some civs with some more unique governments, such as the Marajoara being a Nomadic Horde, and Malacca being a Merchant League. I’m sure each type of government has its benefits, with these two likely giving buffs to military strength and GPT respectively.</p>"
  - scene_number: 08
    scene_title: "Government 102"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>On our last slide of the government overview we see the government types of the last civs we were yet to see. Funnily enough, our spectating sub of Babylon is included as well, aptly with the government type of Tribe in-exile. </p>"

    scene_title: "The Zairian implosion"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>The episode begins with Nigeria’s and Lesotho’s effective pincer of the state of Zaire. Nigerian troops have captured Mbuji-Mayi, and Lesotho ships are close to capturing Hlotse. Troops from both nations surround Lubumbashi. If this effort keeps up, Zaire will be eliminated or at best rumpfied.</p>"
  - scene_number: 10
    scene_title: "Isn’t it a bit too early to be getting into inter-continental wars?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>Kulin and Malacca’s war continues on, but Kulin doesn’t necessarily have a pointed battle plan for his troops. Malaccan ships will likely pick off many of the troops crossing the ocean, though they are yet to mount a counter attack themselves, though.</p>"
  - scene_number: 11
    scene_title: "Fancy yourself a Roman?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Vandals dust off their new city of Peje, admiring their work in trying to create the next Roman Empire. Holding a stronger grip on the Mediterranean than cycle 1, Vandals have a solid military and navy to defend their conquests. PARG’s somehow unsuccessful still siege of Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan, continues in the corner of the map, with PARG just not dealing any damage to the city for some reason, even though it is surrounded.</p>"
  - scene_number: 12
    scene_title: "Native Warfare"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>The war between the Dene and NN continues into this episode, with both of NN’s border cities sustaining damage. With both being relatively bottlenecked, NN isn’t having much trouble defending them. Both nations still have a relatively sizeable base of troops to support them, so this war will likely last for a while yet.</p>"
  - scene_number: 13
    scene_title: "Southern Strategy"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>While the Neutrals are holding their ground against the Dene, the same can’t necessarily be said for their war against Marajoara. With a huge army and nowhere else to send it, Marajoara has dealt heavy damage to the Neutral city in Cuba, and will likely take it in the next turn or two. With such a large invading force, it’s anyone’s guess as to how far they will advance into NN territory.</p>"
  - scene_number: 14
    scene_title: "High tensions"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>This slide here gives us a good view of the Vandals’ core, along with the Gauls. Both have sizable militaries, though the Vandals hold the advantage when it comes to navies. Similar to cycle 1, the Vandals’ empire is almost entirely coastal, and their navy is made up of their unique unit, a trireme replacement. The Vandals may be gearing up for their next war, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they targeted the Gauls, possibly to reclaim their 2nd city in Spain, Lilybaeum.</p>"
  - scene_number: 15
    scene_title: "A Change in Management"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>Unsurprisingly, Marajoara capture Michilimackinac. With Onguiaahra just across the water, Marajoara could advance deep into NN territory with the invading force they control now. As they expand their sphere of influence, they also increase their chances of winning the entire game. Many think because they started with all of South America to themselves, Marajoara could win the entire royale, but nothing is set in stone yet.</p>"
  - scene_number: 16
    scene_title: "Finally, some damage!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>It seems that Kolchak has finally realized that his catapults can actually be fired at the city to capture it, after having it surrounded for the last half an episode. With such an overwhelming amount of troops surrounding the capital, Uzbekistan will likely only be able to hold their capital if PARG manages to somehow mess this up, which, for the record, is entirely possible.</p>"
  - scene_number: 17
    scene_title: "Not so bad once you realize you have no chance of winning"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>With Germany and the USSR being their two neighbors, Finland kind of just settles into Scandinavia. Their time to prove us wrong has since passed, and will likely live on for the rest of their time in Scandinavia, as they wait for Germany or the USSR to try to expand their territory again.</p>"
  - scene_number: 18
    scene_title: "Throwing their hat back in the ring"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rio Grande declares war on the Dene, seeking to possible capture more land from their northern neighbor. Their primary strike force currently consists of horsemen, a unit not well known for their ability to damage cities, but they have some catapults and composite bowmen scattered around their empire. I would give the military advantage to Rio Grande, as the Dene already have a large portion of their military dedicated to fighting the Neutrals. </p>"
  - scene_number: 19
    scene_title: "Loose ends, and all that."
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>NYuan looks to put an end to Kosovo’s Siberian adventure, sending a more than adequate sieging force to capture Gjilani. Being one of the last few areas of the world that aren’t yet settled, Northern Yuan wants to lock down this territory for themselves. </p>"
  - scene_number: 20
    scene_title: "Nigeria FTW!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>Nigeria holds Mbuji-Mayi and continues to deal more damage to Lubumbashi. All is not dire for Zaire though, I suppose. Lesotho backs off of Hlotse, though they still have land-based troops pushing into their territory. Nigeria in cycle 2 has been a bit underwhelming, but is proving their military skills through this war against Zaire. The territory that Zaire holds could shift the power in Africa. For Nigeria, it would elevate them that much closer to the position of most powerful in the cylinder, and for Lesotho it could put them on the road to being a global power.</p>"
  - scene_number: 21
    scene_title: "The Icy Frontier"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Germany and the Gauls race to settle the northern expanses of Europe, reaching all the way to Greenland now. Germany already has two cities in Greenland, and the Gauls are just about to land a settler to set up their first settlement on the island. At this rate, Germany or the Gauls might get a city or two in North America.</p>"
  - scene_number: 22
    scene_title: "I countered your attack with an attack of my own!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca beats back a Kulin offensive and sends their own ships in a counter attack. Doing solid damage with their caravel replacements, Malacca might be able to capture the city of Marpeang Balug, but it is unlikely they will be able to hold it against Kulin’s land army. </p>"
  - scene_number: 23
    scene_title: "War were declared!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene23.jpg
    narration: "<p>War breaks out across the cylinder, with PARG’s western and eastern neighbors both simultaneously declare war. Malacca and Northern Yuan declare war on Punjab as well. Malacca has a naval force already sieging Hazara, and will likely take it as well. With their caravel replacements, Malacca could take some coastal cities from Punjab, as they will likely be able to overcome their trireme based navy.</p>"
  - scene_number: 24
    scene_title: "A Malaccan landing!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca manages to capture Marpeang Balug, though it will certainly flip at least a few times before it settles. Can’t quite say I envy the citizens living there, that’s for sure. Malacca’s caravel replacement is quite strong especially as most other civs in the world are still using triremes and maybe galleases. </p>"
  - scene_number: 25
    scene_title: "Mountains always ruin the fun"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>The wonderful Ural Mountains will likely keep PARG safe from most Soviet aggression, as they cover almost half of their border, giving PARG only a few bottlenecks they have to defend rather than their entire western border. Though the Soviets have a solidly strong army to invade, I am unsure as to how likely they will be to take PARG cities.</p>"
  - scene_number: 26
    scene_title: "No mountains here ;)"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>Now PARG’s eastern border has no such mountains to save them. NYuan could easily capture some of PARK's less developed northern cities, and then advance to their core. These declarations of war against PARG very well may save Uzbekistan from losing their capital, if PARG decides to pull back his troops to defend his borders.</p>"
  - scene_number: 27
    scene_title: "The Central African War, continued"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>Nigeria finally captures Lubumbashi, and as such Zaire is down to only 3 cities. Lesotho has brought in a force of troops outside of Hlotse big enough to capture it, and troops from both nations advance on Zaire’s capital, Kinshasa. The constant onslaught Zaire has had to deal with at this point has whittled down their chances of being a major global player to nearly zero, as they have not had a moment of peace in quite a while now. From how long the war has kept on, Nigeria and Lesotho may keep pushing until Zaire is completely eliminated.</p>"
  - scene_number: 28
    scene_title: "Really Kolchak? Just use the catapults!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>Tashkent remains on the same amount of health as we last saw it, as apparently Kolchak does not know how to use catapults. The catapult men sieging Voronezh apparently do know how their job works, and PARG might be able to capture that former Soviet city. </p><p>We also see that Kulin and Malacca have made peace, marking the end of a conflict that will likely re-ignite multiple times in the future.</p>"
  - scene_number: 29
    scene_title: "Boatem Battles"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca manages to capture Hazara, though it looks as if it will be quickly recaptured by Punjabi triremes. The Malaccan city of Siak also is under heavy siege from Punjabi triremes, as it falls into yellow health. Malacca will need to scramble their troops over here if they want to prevent this war from going south on them.</p>"
  - scene_number: 30
    scene_title: "NN: No central american cities!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>Marajoara advances on NN’s cities in the Yucatan peninsula and Florida, dropping Kakouagoga into yellow health. The city will likely fall next turn, and then all troops will look towards Onguiaahra. The end of this war will give Marajoara strong control over all of the Caribbean, giving a solid base for naval production.</p>"
  - scene_number: 31
    scene_title: "Central African War, new update!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene31.jpg
    narration: "<p>Lesotho finally recaptures the city that was originally theirs, Hlotse, and Zaire is down to only 2 cities. Nigeria and Lesotho haven’t dedicated a targeted siege force for Kinshasa yet, but they certainly have the troops to be able to do so. </p><p>The Dene and Neutral Nation also make peace, bringing down the number of nations NN is at war with to just one, but also arguably the most powerful.</p>"
  - scene_number: 32
    scene_title: "PARG actually got a city?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene32.jpg
    narration: "<p>PARG manages to capture Voronezh, while Tashkent’s health remains exactly the same. While they aren’t facing much pressure yet, it would be wise for Kolchak to bolster his defenses in the event that the USSR or Northern Yuan decides to go on the offensive.</p>"
  - scene_number: 33
    scene_title: "Burn it all!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene33.jpg
    narration: "<p>Marajoara captures Kakouagoga, unsurprisingly, and sets it ablaze. Their troops begin to attack Onguiaahra, which Marajoara stands a good chance to be able to capture.</p>"
  - scene_number: 34
    scene_title: "Kosovo has got to Koso-go"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene34.jpg
    narration: "<p>NYuan brings Gjilani to yellow health, and considering Kosovo only has a composite bowmen stationed to defend it, I wouldn’t bet on Kosovo being able to hold the city for long. Northern Yuan troops also begin attacking Saratov, dealing light damage to the city.</p>"
  - scene_number: 35
    scene_title: "Indian Ocean War, continued"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene35.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca’s city of Pazhaiyarai falls to no health, and will likely fall next turn to Punjabi troops. Malacca manages to hold on to Hazara and Siak for another turn though, as they have a small naval force reinforcing Siak and will likely send their ships west.</p>"
  - scene_number: 36
    scene_title: "Ah, consolidation."
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene36.jpg
    narration: "<p>Gjilani falls to NYuan, and they can now focus primarily on PARG. with a strong military, NYuan stands a good chance to capture some of PARG’s smaller cities in the north, which will help NYuan in the long term. Chita takes small damage, but at the same time has little reinforcements.</p><p>Nigeria constructs Notre Dame, a source of +10 happiness for the empire, which will help to negate the unhappiness that came from capturing Zairian cities.</p>"
  - scene_number: 37
    scene_title: "Uh… Nice job?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene37.jpg
    narration: "<p>Kosovo and NYuan make an… interesting peace deal, with Kosovo giving away Prizreni, a city that they have no real way of capturing. I’m not sure exactly what Kosovo has planned with this peace deal, or maybe they’re just ready to get out of the game at this point. NYuan decides to set the city ablaze, and Kosovo is reduced to just their capital city, possibly on the block to be the next civ eliminated.</p>"

    scene_title: "Finally Kolchak!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene38.jpg
    narration: "<p>PARG finally uses their catapults on Uzbekistan’s capital, bringing it down to red health. With Uzbekistan having virtually no troops to defend the city, it is essentially guaranteed that Kolchak will add this city to his growing collection.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Tides of War turn"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene39.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca’s reinforcements finally arrive, as they turn the tide of the battles in the Indian Ocean. Pazhaiyarai is still holding on, and both Thanjavur along with Cholapuram are under siege from Malaccan ships. Malacca’s technological superiority is showing in this war, with their access to much more powerful ships than Punjab wields.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene40.jpg
    narration: "<p>Marajoara troops continue to siege Onguiaahra, bringing it down to yellow health. Marajoara gaining a foothold in North America could help them to break out of South America, a hurdle that is difficult for any AI. </p>"

    scene_title: "Another one bites the dust"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene41.jpg
    narration: "<p>Tashkent is the next capital to fall in the CBRX 2 Cycle 2! (isn’t that a mouthful) This city will undoubtedly be a good addition to Kolchak’s collection, as he seeks to build up his strength going forward in the game. With the rough terrain and Punjabi borders blocking the path to the last of Uzbekistan’s cities, I believe it to be unlikely that they will push further into Uzbekistan territory.</p>"

    scene_title: "Perhaps one of the worst trade deals"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene42.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca and Punjab trade cities on opposing sides of the Indian peninsula, with Malacca picking up Thanjavur while Punjab captures Pazhaiyarai. Malacca holds naval supremacy of the area surrounding all of these coastal cities, so they stand a good chance to leave this war controlling all of southern India.</p>"

    scene_title: "The State of Europe"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene43.jpg
    narration: "<p>This shot gives us a good look at Europe, with our two main powers in Western and Central Europe, being the Gauls and Germany. Both civs look to be similarly matched, with Germany perhaps having an edge militarily. The Vandals in the Mediterranean, though, which could pose a threat to the Gauls, having multiple coastal cities that the Vandals could seek to capture.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene44.jpg
    narration: "<p>NYuans invasion of PARG begins in earnest, now that they have captured Kosovo’s city of Gjilani. Northern Yuan troops surround Chita, the first of likely a few more cities controlled by PARG that stand a chance to be captured by these invading soldiers.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Flipping Begins"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene45.jpg
    narration: "<p>Unsurprisingly, Malacca recaptures Pazhaiyarai, though it is in the red. With Malacca having naval supremacy and Punjab having land dominance, it is likely that these few cities in India will flip many times before they settle with their eventual ruler. Cholapuram falls to yellow health, and will likely join these other cities in flipping between Malacca and Punjab soon.</p>"

    scene_title: "Watching collapse in slow motion"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene46.jpg
    narration: "<p>Marajoara seems to love to watch the Neutral Nations and their fans alike suffer, as they reduce Onguiaahra to no health, refraining from capturing it yet. As long as Marajoara has naval control of the seas, they can advance as far up the coast as they want into NN territory. To add insult to injury, Rio Grande declares war once again on the Neutrals. With Rio Grande being fresh and ready for war while the Neutrals have been battered and bruised for years now, the Neutrals are certainly on the backfoot.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene48.jpg
    narration: "<p>We can see the large expanse that is Northern Yuan’s core, controlling a solid 15 cities in this shot alone. We can see that most of their army is currently stationed further north, likely marching toward PARG territory. They might need to be wary of the Chukchi, as their eastern border is looking a little lightly defended from possible invasion.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode24-scene49.jpg
    narration: "<p>We can now see the reasoning Kulin had for declaring war on Northern Yuan, as they settled the city of Tsetserleg just north of their borders. Being settled so close to the Kulin, NYuan likely won’t be able to hold it, as the city is so disconnected from their core. </p>"

    narration: "<p>In a surprise steal, Rio Grande grabs Onguiaahra right out of Marajoara’s fingertips. While NN may be facing less of a threat from Marajoara now, Rio Grande is right on their border with a huge army marching right towards them. I hope for the best for NN, stay strong!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Ptolemy in his great kindness shares with us some intriguing statistics, with him showing us the military might of the nations around the cylinder. The Vandals stand at the top, followed closely by the Chukchi. A little further behind we see the Dene, Malacca, Rio Grande, and then Marajoara in that order. What intrigues me is the Chukchi on this list, as they still have not participated in any major wars yet. They could make some big gains with the size military they have.</p>"
