  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene01.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hello and welcome to Episode 22 of the CBRX Season 2! I’m u/daXfactorz, also known as NopeCopter, and I’m incredibly honored to be bringing you the first episode of Season 2 Cycle 2 today. It’s been a chaotic two weeks, but thanks to the hard work of the Blue Cassette team, we’re still on schedule. But enough about that - let’s get on to the OC slides!</p>"

  scene_title: "The Last Time You’ll Ever See the Cycle 1 Map"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s not exactly relevant now that the game has been reset, but it just wouldn’t feel right to open an episode without one of Vihreaa’s incredibly hand-drawn maps. It’s clear that Total War did a number on a few civilizations - will they be able to redeem themselves, or will those unlucky few end up being fodder for their stronger neighbors?</p>"

  narration: "<p>I am also honored to be able to let you all know that, after a long, long hiatus, Dawkinzz has returned with a new audio narration! Sure, he’s still a bit behind, but it just hasn’t been the same without that buttery-smooth voice to listen to in the background while I do other things. Welcome back, Dawkinzz, you absolute legend you.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene04.jpg
  narration: "<p>As always, a massive thanks to all of the CBR’s supporters on Ko-Fi for making all of this possible! For those unaware, Cycle 2 is currently being run on a computer purchased with the Ko-Fi money, so it’s 100% true that your donations make a difference.</p><p>Coiot: We could not have done it without everyone's help! It's been a really tiresome and stressfull development period to get to final production, but we got through it. Once again a reminder that every contribution has an impact, and we'll be able to offer more from within the game for the remainder of this season (and hopefully even more in the next).</p>"

  scene_title: "PRajoara"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr21-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>According to our Power Rankers, the civilization in the best position going into Cycle 2 is… the Marajoara? Yes, even the overwhelming strength of Punjab, Malacca, and Nigeria weren’t enough to overcome the power of the Marajoara’s geography in the eyes of the PRs. But keep in mind that this is all just (mostly blind) speculation on the PRs’ part right now - anything could happen once the game kicks off! Speaking of which, let’s go hop on over to the sub and get all of the pre-game stuff out of the way.</p>"

  scene_title: "Re-Sub"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nebuchadnezzar II looks over the new, smaller world, with Pedro II and Abd al-Rahman III at either side. This world is populated with the most tenacious (though not necessarily the strongest) competitors of Cycle 1, given a second chance to conquer the world and earn their place among the greats. This will surely be a wild ride, but before Nebby throws the switch and starts the game again, let’s meet our competitors, shall we?</p>"

  scene_title: "You’re Up, Europe"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our first two civilizations here are Cycle 1’s eternal European rivals, the Gauls and Germany. The Gauls are in a bit of an awkward spot here. Europe isn’t as large as it used to be, and Germany could easily box the Gauls in early on. But I wouldn’t count them out just yet - the Gauls have plenty of Mine-related bonuses and plenty of mineral resources nearby to take advantage of. They’ll just need to act fast and play aggressively.</p><p></p><p>Germany, on the other hand, seems poised to fare much better. Germany kind of under-performed in Cycle 1, especially considering their UA is absolutely perfect for Total War, but it hardly matters now - Germany has ample space to expand on all sides, and their generally-competent AI means that they’re likely to take advantage of this.(If you’re wondering where the bonuses are, don’t worry - they’ll be loaded in next turn.)</p>"

  scene_title: "Echoes of Marx Past"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Throughout Cycle 1, Lenin’s Soviets were kind of like the opposite of Mark 2’s Stalin - while both were imposing but sleepy at first, Stalin was slowly ground down by enemies that grew larger and played smarter, while Lenin was the one doing the grinding. This has paid off for Lenin - the Soviets have plenty of space to expand now. The Soviets are surrounded by enemies, with Germans to the west and White Russians to the east, but if his reputation is anything to go by, Lenin should be a force to be reckoned with.</p><p></p><p>Mannerheim’s Finland was also sort of like the opposite of Mark 2’s Finland under Kekkonen - except in this case, that’s a bad thing. While Kekkonen was one of the most wacky and chaotic civilizations the CBR has ever seen, Mannerheim did literally nothing for the entirety of Cycle 1. Considering Finland isn’t even starting in its original capital this time, Mannerheim has his work cut out for him if he even wants to be remembered, let alone win.</p>"

  scene_title: "Chaos, Chaos"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kosovo is a bit of an odd case. They barely survived Cycle 2 by a matter of turns, and of course they’ll be starting with almost no bonuses as a result. However, they also have the Middle East all to themselves, which could give them a chance to build a decent empire if they act fast. But whether they manage to overcome the odds or not, I do at least hope we’ll see Kosovo cause some chaos with their UA that drags their friends into any wars declared on them. There just wasn’t enough of that in Cycle 1!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even weirder are the Vandals. The infamously-underperforming Vandals managed to build a massive seafaring empire spanning four continents in Cycle 1, only to almost lose it all in Total War. Now they have another chance, but with their poor AI, the odds of the Vandals being able to outplay their mighty neighbor Nigeria seem unlikely. Will lightning strike twice and allow the Vandals to pull some legendary shenanigans once more? I sure hope so.</p>"

  scene_title: "I Bless the Reigns"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, Nigeria. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, you have to admit that they played really well throughout Cycle 1, becoming one of the strongest civilizations in the game by the time Cycle 1 ended and even crippling their main rival Zaire. With plenty of land and several weak neighbors to prey on, Nigeria looks ready to dominate the competition yet again, especially with their UA that grants them extra Food and Faith every time a new citizen is born.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Zaire, they’re definitely going to have a rough time in this game after getting ripped apart by Nigeria and Lesotho during Total War. However, it’s not entirely hopeless - their new capital location means they’re not trapped between Nigeria and Lesotho this time, and they should have plenty of room to expand. Surviving shouldn’t be too hard for Zaire. Winning, though, will certainly be a tall order with Nigeria in the way.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "King of the Hill"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho and Nigeria are sort of like a mirror image of Zimbabwe and Benin from CBRX1. Two African powers, one mighty and dominant, and the other resourceful and tenacious. One along the Gulf of Guinea, and the other in southern Africa. The only difference is that this time, the roles are switched - Southern Africa’s Lesotho has managed to crawl its way out of obscurity by preying on the dying Zaire during Total War, and with their UA that grants cities on hills extra Defense, they should remain a thorn in any African power’s side for a while even if they don’t end up winning.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Three-Steppe Problem"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>We have three entire civilizations on this slide, so I’ll make their introductions quick. The Provisional All-Russian Government is a civ that’s perfectly positioned to cause excitement. Their aggressive AI and weaker neighbors mean they could potentially score some early knockouts, and with Great Perm gone, a bloody Soviet-PARG war is all but guaranteed to occur.</p><p></p><p>Uzbekistan has had such a fall from grace, going from a massive blob in the middle of the map capable of destroying civs from across the continent to a broke, backwards mess that got carved up during Total War. Uzbekistan has a chance to redeem themself here, but they’re also stuck between PARG and Punjab - not an enviable position at all.</p><p></p><p>Northern Yuan was in the middle of being eaten alive by Malacca when Cycle 1 ended. Despite that, I think they’re honestly a bit of a dark horse going into Cycle 2. The quality and AI and ample room for expansion that got them ranked first in Episode 0’s Power Rankings haven’t changed, so if they play their cards right and don’t fall asleep, they could become a serious threat.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "The Sick Man and the Sikh Man"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sitting alone in China is Taiping, who only barely survived Total War with a single city to their name. Things are looking grim for the Brother of Christ going into Cycle 2, but China is full of good land, and Malacca will probably be focusing on naval expansion first - so long as Taiping can avoid the wrath of Northern Yuan, they might be able to form a respectable empire. Too bad their UA is based on capturing cities, something that they almost certainly won’t be doing much of for a while.</p><p></p><p>Punjab is the polar opposite of Taiping. They performed extremely well in Cycle 1, and they have multiple excellent expansion opportunities and a solid AI. However, Punjab also has to worry about rough terrain that could make conquest difficult, and their weak neighbors could easily box them in if Punjab isn’t careful. It’s a bit of a tricky start, but I’d definitely bet on Punjab here.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Two-for-One Sail"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chola performed remarkably well throughout Cycle 1 despite their powerful neighbors, and managed to easily hold out through Total War to make it into Cycle 2. Now they have another chance to make it big and become a naval powerhouse. Unfortunately, the dynamic duo of Punjab and Malacca are still present, ready to box the Chola in and crush them if the opportunity arises. Chola will have to play seriously well if they want to have a chance this time around.</p><p></p><p>Malacca, the breakout star of Cycle 1, is also here. Successful naval powers are rare in the CBR, but Malacca managed to build a seafaring empire that rivaled even the best land empires of the cylinder - but now they have to do it again. With their sea-focused uniques and plenty of bonuses, Malacca should be fine as long as they don’t decide to focus their efforts inland for some reason (which sounds like something the AI would do), but they do have their work cut out for them if they want to rule not just the waves but the world.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Kulin Off"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kulin start the game off with all of Australia to themselves! While this might sound nice, it’s actually both a blessing and a curse - sure, the Kulin are safe from invasion, but they’ll also have a tough time breaking out of their isolated start and becoming more than just an impenetrable turtle. Then again, they managed that quite well in Cycle 1, so if anyone can manage to secure a solid foothold in Asia or South America from Australia, it’ll be the Kulin.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Too Cool, Go Back"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi are one of those civilizations that always feel like they’re on the verge of failure, and going into Cycle 2, that hasn’t changed much. Without any uniques to help them survive in the Arctic, the Chukchi seem like they’ll have trouble building an empire to rival the Dene or Northern Yuan. However, the Chukchi have more space than it seems like they should, and they’ve over-performed many times before - can they do it again?</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Mother and Son"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nobody expected the Dene to rule North America going into Cycle 1. Their uniques are all geared towards Culture and Religion, and their AI is generally mediocre. But against all odds, the Dene not only survived but thrived, and now they’re entering Cycle 2 as one of the top contenders. Now all they have to do is not sit around and waste their early lead… knowing the Dene, it could go either way.</p><p></p><p>Going from a massive over-performer to a massive under-performer, the Neutrals should not be here. Ranked third in the Episode 0 Power Rankings, the Neutrals spent most of the game as a rump state before being unceremoniously eliminated. But then the Dene brought them back during Total War and gave them a miraculous second chance in Cycle 2… with no bonuses at all. While they may seem absolutely screwed, remember that the Neutrals were ranked so high initially for a reason. Considering all the space they have, and the tendency of the Dene to underperform, the Neutrals could be the ultimate dark horse… or they could just be a legendary meme civ.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Cheap Shot"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rio Grande might be one of the most controversial civs in the history of the CBR. Thanks to a bug with their UB (which grants extra city defense for every river tile in the city the UB is built in), Rio Grande’s city defenses grew to absurd levels and made the civ practically untouchable. This bug has been patched in Cycle 2, but now we’re left with a question: did Rio Grande deserve to make it this far, or are they just a fraud that was carried by their UB? I guess we’re about to find out.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Marajo Madness"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our final competitor is Marajoara. Carrying on the tradition of South American civs becoming serious contenders in the CBR, the Marajoara were so powerful in test runs of Cycle 2 that their bonuses had to be nerfed! It’s no wonder why, either - while their AI is hit-or-miss, the Marajoara have all of South America to themselves, and unlike the Kulin, they have an early naval UU and several targets to conquer. But will the Marajoara live up to the legacy of Brazil? Or will someone else take home the crown? It’s time to find out! CBRX3 Cycle 2 begins… now!</p>"

  scene_title: "Getting Inkozy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here come the bonuses! In addition to units and free techs, many civilizations are also starting with religions. Let’s take a look at them, shall we?</p><p></p><p>First up are the Dene, who have founded Inkoze. Their four extra Settlers and legions of free Swordsmen should give them a serious leg up in North America, which they might need depending on how aggressively their AI decides to play. Their religion is almost guaranteed to do well, though - the Dene UA and UI both provide methods of generating Faith through Tundra tiles.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Cooler than Kulin"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kulin are the next to a religion, founding Tagai. Their bonuses have given them a massive seven extra Settlers, and without any neighbors, they don’t have to worry about spreading themselves too thin, either! You might also notice that the Kulin have Pikemen while the Dene have Swordsmen. This is because each civilization is being given the most advanced melee units they can build with the free techs they’ve chosen. So while the Dene must have chosen Iron Working as a free tech, the Kulin must have beelined Civil Service!</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Sikh Horses, Bro"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Punjab is the founder of our third religion, Sikhism. Punjab is also looking quite strong thanks to their bonuses (unlike Uzbekistan and Taiping to the north), but they have made the questionable decision to spec into Horsemen for their free units. Horsemen have a damage penalty against cities, which will make early conquest difficult, and the rough terrain and rivers will hamper the extra movement of the Horsemen. Well, it’s not like Punjab needs to conquer anything right away - for now, those Horsemen will be useful for exploring.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Marajoly"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our fourth civilization to found a religion is the Marajoara with Pajelanca! Even with nerfed bonuses, the Marajoara are looking pretty solid - not that they really need any bonuses at all considering their start location. While settling Panama to block the Rio Grande out of South America could be a smart move, it doesn’t seem like the Marajoara care too much about that right now - instead, they’re aiming their Settlers south and east.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Welcome to the Jesus Zone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Taiping is the next civilization to start a religion, founding Bai Shangdi Hui. Considering Taiping’s miniscule bonuses, this should at least ensure that they leave a mark on the world somehow… provided Northern Yuan and Malacca don’t found religions of their own, of course. But hey! At least Taiping has the first Archer we’ve seen thus far! (Ignore the fact that Northern Yuan has a Catapult, which is a heck of a lot scarier at this point.)</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Finnish-ing up the Religion Slides"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our final religion for now belongs to Finland, who have founded Lutheranism. All those Forest tiles will help Finland create their unique Rune Singers, which replace Great Writers and can act as Missionaries to spread Finland’s religion. So even if Finland doesn’t do well militarily, their religion seems like it might do extremely well! Their UB the Sauna can also generate Faith and Rune Singer points from Lakes and Marshes, which Finland has plenty of as well.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Genseric’s Magna Dong"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Now that it’s been a few turns, second cities are starting to pop up! First up, we have the Vandals. They’ve already secured a foothold in Europe with the settlement of Leptis Magna - the Vandals’ UA should give their cities on foreign continents extra Population and Tiles, but in this case all of Afro-Eurasia counts as “one continent” so there’s no bonus. Sorry, Genseric!</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Germany, eager to defeat the Gauls quickly, decides to employ the famed France-conquering tactic of invading Belgium first. Unfortunately, there’s nobody in Belgium to invade right now, so Germany just settles Hamburg in the area instead.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "The Terracotta Squadron"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho builds the first wonder of the game! It’s the Terracotta Army, a Wonder which grants them an extra copy of every type of military unit they own… all two of them. Two extra units hardly make a dent in Lesotho’s already solid military force, but when you share a continent with Nigeria, any extra power is appreciated.</p>"

  scene_title: "Golden Opportunity"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>A Rio Grande Scout approaches Chief Antonio Rosillo with big news: deep in Mesoamerica, several ancient pyramids have been found, apparently built by some “Olmec” schmucks thousands of years ago. Not wanting to be outdone by the dead, Rosillo orders the construction of pyramids of his own! Too bad Rosillo’s architects have never seen a Mesoamerican-style pyramid. Rio Grande ends up accidentally building Egyptian-style pyramids instead, but the citizens decide that these are still pretty cool. The people of the sub seem to agree - they’re excited enough to kick off our first Golden Age!</p>"

  scene_title: "Beghaniche’ers"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Dene settle their second city towards the North American heartland. The Dene can settle the tundra to their north any time, but Rio Grande and the Neutrals will be trying to claim the fertile Great Plains as well, so I’d say this is a smart move. The city itself has plenty of resources too!</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Petrograbbed"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Soviets settle their second city of Petrograd to the west, towards Germany. With the All-Russians trapped behind the Ural Mountains and Finland being a total joke, Germany is certainly Lenin’s biggest threat, so a defensible city like Petrograd between them and Moscow is a great call. It’s also a great jumping-off point for further expansion into the fertile lands of Eastern Europe, which Germany will certainly also be racing for.</p>"

  scene_title: "Max-Defense Forward Settle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of defensible second cities, Zaire’s Lubumbashi has mountains on one side and Jungle on the other, while also being built on top of a hill! Nigeria will have a tough time taking this city for sure, especially with those Horsemen of theirs. Nigeria just might be able to break through with sheer numbers, though, especially after they place all those Settlers and get to building more troops.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Ocean Mountain Man"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho’s second city of Maseru is another defensible city, at least by land. Mountains and ocean surround the city, and it’s built on a hill, which grants it even more defense thanks to Lesotho’s UA! It’s a fairly conservative settle, though - Lesotho has plenty of land available to settle, but they’ll need to grab it fast or Zaire and Nigeria could easily box them in.</p><p></p><p>(Also of Note: the Dene, upon learning that Rio Grande built the wrong type of pyramid, constructs their own Mesoamerican pyramids in order to flex.)</p>"

  scene_title: "Ibadass"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nigeria decides that spiting the Vandals and scoring some sick minerals is a lot more important than access to farmland, and so they settle their second city of Ibadan in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Just outside the city is one of the Vandal UUs, the Alani Horseman! This unit is identical to an ordinary Horseman, except it can also be trained as a Settler. I don’t think that these ones can settle cities, since they were given for free rather than trained, but if they can… oh boy. (Also, the Vandals have three cities now!)</p>"

  scene_title: "Going South"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of spite, Punjab is so mad that Chola managed to hold them off throughout Cycle 1 that they’re not even going to give them a chance this time around. They’ve already forward-settled Chola pretty hard with Amritsar, and now they’re sending another Settler even further south! Luckily, Chola does have a Settler traveling along the eastern coast, so they shouldn’t be completely boxed in just yet. Meanwhile, Taiping wisely settles Jintian in the opposite direction of Northern Yuan, and Malacca kindly demonstrates that they can embark units.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Kulin’s second city of Barere Barere Balug is fairly tame, but there are plenty more Kulin Settlers already fanning out across the continent. At this rate, William Barak should have no trouble claiming his entire home continent long before anyone else even has a chance to send a Settler over.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Marajoara decide to settle their second city up the Amazon River. Unlike the Kulin, the Marajoara seem to be keeping all of their units closer to home for now. Well, except for their Great Artist - P’kuee has tasked them with cataloguing all of South America’s natural beauty, a duty they’re eagerly carrying out as we speak. They’ve also sent a Warrior to go make sure that Rio Grande doesn’t get any ideas about settling on Marajoara’s turf.</p>"

  scene_title: "Grande Wall"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rio Grande isn’t interested in expanding into South America, of course - they’d rather build a wall of cities to keep those pesky northerners out of Mesoamerica. Both of their new settlements have sea access, and Monterrey is quite well-defended, so breaking through Rio Grande seems like it’ll be tough even without their defense bug. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode22-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi have a pantheon, and they’ve chosen Dance of the Aurora as their belief - with all the nearby Tundra tiles, they’re practically guaranteed a religion now. Also, despite having the ability to embark units, the Chukchi don’t seem to be planning on settling in North America just yet. Honestly, this would probably give them a stronger core, so I’d say it’s a good call on Lawtiliwadlin’s part.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Both the Gauls and Germany are now up to three cities, though Germany has two more Settlers and plenty of room to expand. It’s not over yet for the Gauls, though - they have their UU, the Oathsworn! This Swordsman replacement is not only stronger, but also grants a combat bonus to the Gauls upon dying. The Gauls just might be able to bust through Germany if they attack while the Oathsworn are still relevant… but they just don’t have the numbers to earn a decisive victory right now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Soviets now have a third city to the east of Moscow, with two more Settlers ready to reinforce the eastern front against the All-Russians! To celebrate, Lenin orders the construction of a massive statue of himself… but it comes out looking nothing like him. Lenin promptly “dismisses” the people who made the statue, and then tries to convince his citizens that it was never meant to be him at all, but rather some “Zeus” guy. Nobody buys it, but they’re obviously not going to tell that to the guy who just murdered hundreds of craftsmen because they built a statue wrong.</p>"
