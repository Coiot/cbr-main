The weather today is beautiful, perfect for staying at home and watching digital pixels fight each other in the second edition of CBRX. So take a big breath, fasten your seatbelts and get ready for the sixth episode. Will we see the first elimination? How many cities will be burned? How many innocent civilians killed? Will your investments pay off? So many questions, only one way to find out. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We resume this episode with the Welsh fighting for their life against the Gauls. The latter are pushing against the last enemy city after conquering, settling, and (mostly) burning down the Welsh homeland. However, they're probably still a bit drunk after all that razing and are forgetting to reinforce the expeditionary force with melee units. The Welsh have submitted all their remaining civil and political power to the Last General in Casnewydd. He’s trying to coordinate his remaining few troops, his life and position on the line. Not an enviable position</p>"

    narration: "<p>Two Sicilies take back Gjakove with a Carrack. Thanks to their UA, they've automatically upgraded their whole Navy after researching Compass. This also means they have unlocked the Galleass. Having ranged ships could actually swing the war in favour of the Italian representative. They need all the help they can get, since on the land Wilhelm II has the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Last episode Two Sicilies and Kosovo also made peace, so the Balkanic civ keeps his capital after a back and forth fight.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Vandals consolidate their position in Spain bringing more supplies and units from North Africa. Still, it’s unlikely they'll be able to push further. Carlos III must use this little breathing window to reinforce his capital (for example, building walls. Just a suggestion, Carlos). Somehow, Spain is in the Medieval Era (we can spot some pikemans), but has no composite bowmans.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Pliny has finished his masterpiece, the “List of people less likely to burn down a captured city”. From the list, we may confirm our suspect: the Welsh are really masochists arsonists. They are simply too happy after all the blood and flames that destroyed their former cities. If you're wondering why the gap between the first leader and the rest is so wide, it's because Bhutan gains one happiness for every owned mountain. Quite fitting for a leader that IRL has advocated for using the Gross National Happiness index to measure the well-being of citizens rather than GDP.</p>"

I asked them what the diapers were for and he said “they contain my full power so I don’t completely shit on these Hejaz kids”.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe not, but they managed to take Al Bahah. Wow.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Kolchak, PARG's leader, takes a history lesson and discovers that the USSR is their natural enemy. Promptly, he summons his ambassadors and tells them to declare war against “that red civilization”. The advisors try to convince him that he's confusing the USSR and Vietnam, but he quits their doubts with a lapidary sentence: “I‘m paid to lead, not to read”.</p><p></p><p>On a more serious note, I’m fairly confident PARG has more catapults than all the other civs combined.</p>"

The beacons are lit!”. The unimpressed Tuskaloosa smiles and declares “Yeah, my people were a little unhappy, so I decided to burn down another city. They love this kind of stuff, the fires, the flames, the smell of burning human corpses, y'know, the usual. Now, don't interrupt me again, we're planning the assault of Sashin”</p>"

    narration: "<p>From now on, I'll refer to this war as “battle of the weaks”. Somalia still has WARRIORS AND ARCHERS! Turns out that giving away for free your second largest city for no reason hurts your chances of success. Who would have thought?</p>"

I don't see them being able to push efficiently against the two remaining Tuareg cities. I feel they should stop now and focus on building more units, this war has left their core quite empty.</p><p></p><p>Capital attacked counter: 2 </p>"

    narration: "<p>My father measures IQ for a living. I asked him to watch 154 turns of Mississippi gameplay and to then provide a rough estimate of the intelligence quotient for the popular American civ.</p><p>After not speaking with my father for about a month, I received a text early one morning that simply read, “fuckfuckfuck.”</p><p>Confused, I asked what was wrong.</p><p>“That American fellow you asked me to study, I've never seen anything like it. He's operating on a plain of intelligence four to five times higher than the smartest men I've ever studied. His tactical troops management is communicating cryptic hidden messages. He's displaying levels of strategy that should not be remotely possible.”</p><p>I had completely forgotten about asking my father to study Canyon, but now I was intrigued, “So how high is his IQ?” I inquired.</p><p>He responded mere seconds later, “Just under infinity.”</p><p></p><p>A huge crowd of merry Mississippians is still cheering for the pyrotechnic show, but now the party's over.</p><p>“Don't worry, don't worry” reassures Tuskaloosa “We tactically delayed the capture of Sanish so now has 3 pops and will burn down for longer!”</p><p>A round of applause and shouts welcomed his speech.</p>"

    narration: "<p>It turns out my prediction was pretty accurate: Two Sicilies is stalling out Germany thanks to their dominance in the Adriatic Sea. Granted, the terrain is also helping the defenders a lot, with those small chokepoints, hills and forests. Germany seems to be running out of steam, their core is rather empty (excluding civilian units).</p>"

    narration: "<p>Well, we can now see why Germany's core is pretty void: they're fighting a two-front war. Sweden has recruited an healthy Army of swordsmen and composite bowmans and they're so close to take back their former city of Gothenburg. They're also fighting in the sea. Taking Posen would shift the war balance heavily in their favour.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Germany takes a page from Two Sicilies' war manual and uses their Navy to simultaneously capture Malmo and Gothenburg.

There are some quick skirmishes outside Kandoucho, but the capital has such a good defensive geographical position. Let's see if Neural Nation can properly use their UU, the Chonnonton War Band, a stronger swordsman. Wait, is that a... musketman on the right of Niagara? The Chonnonton can be freely upgraded into a musketman, but only once gunpowder is discovered. Is this a small bug? Let’s hope is inconsequential. </p><p></p><p>Capital attacked count: 4 </p>"

In her motivational speech, she declares that the war will last “at most six days.” Her boldness is certainly justified: Jerusalem may be the capital with fewer inhabitants in the whole Cylinder.

    narration: "<p>We're lucky that the city with the best name in the entire Cylinder is a capital and therefore cannot be burned down. Like-a-fishhock is now surrounded by a coalition of Mississippian and Chinookian troops. Somehow, Sanish is still in Three Affiliated Tribes's (incompetent) hands. At this point, I can't help but believe that Tuskaloosa is just asserting his dominance.

They can't even launch a 90 kg projectile over 300 meters”</p><p>He glimpsed at the map and then came up with a genius idea: they will use them against Uzbekistan, an enemy they actually border with!</p><p>“Sometimes my genius is... almost frightening” he smiled to himself.</p>"

Jamaica is victim of a coalition composed by Gran Colombia, Mississippi, Yuan, and Malacca. Because fuck ‘em, that’s why, I suppose.

Is there a more beautiful yet often horrendous showing of Civ AI anywhere? I think not. Germany can have his production and all his glory, but someone fires up the cannons for the Gran Colombia bandwagon. Pull out your pack of Colombian stonks and just try calming those nerves as you watch Colombia jump into four enemies yet again. Forward settled twice in the first 2 episodes.

God I just melted (and the city too), it was like they had been at work for 180 turns, working their ass off to get the big deal and city captures, and they came home, all tired and run down. I had been working my hardest to burn their favorite town, Berezniki. I knew this part had been so hard on them, and I wanted it to be perfect, but as I was putting the finishing touches on it, I could tell, it just wasn't going to be that great. My heart starts racing as I wonder how they'll react, the city is just slightly too cooked and I know I over-seasoned the population. My heart is literally in my throat as they come home and give me a quick kiss before sitting down to eat. And then it happens, they take the first bite, and then smile and say “This is amazing honey, thanks” We both know that it's not as good as it could be, but he still gives me that smile and wolfs it down like it's the best thing he's ever had.
