  scene_title: "TOTAL WAR FOR FOUR ALL GORE TOP SCORE"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene01.jpg
  narration: "<p>Yo its me u/Orangechrisy, creator of Malacca and of the Malacca in the Middle comics, back again after 29 episodes, still crying myself to sleep for the past like month due to Malacca getting knocked out- Oh no the tears are coming back T-T MALACCA MY BELOVED I’LL NEVER FORGET YOU!</p><p></p><p>Anyways, it’s total war time! I have no idea what’s gonna happen but I really hope Kulin dies, no offensive Kulin fans but Kulin should never have outlived Malacca. Also it’s the gay month and I’m gay so that means you have to listen to and accept my anti-Kulin ramblings. </p>"

  narration: "<p>u/daXfactorz aka NopeCopter has given us some wonderful greatest extent maps. Seeing Gran Colombia’s though was saddening, they got quite big before their fall, but alas it wasn’t meant to be.</p>"

  scene_title: "It’s the PR slide!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr33-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi have retaken top spot as every ranker places them in 1st. They have less army and tech then Marajoara, but those will be shored up quickly. They have a strong production lead and a lot more cities. They also have a lot of nexuses. Jesus that's a lot of nexuses.</p><p></p><p>Note: 68 and 56 cities feels like way too little for how many cities info addict says they have like half way through this episode. They don’t look like they’ve taken that much on the map and yet they have like double those city counts somehow. </p>"

  scene_title: "Nwarth American"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our first slide of total war starts here in North America, a battleground of the two premier powers. Roughly equidistant from the two’s capitals, it seems the Chukchi have the upper hand due to their mountainous terrain compared to the plains of the Marajoaran lands. We also get to see the last hold out of Rosillo’s once great empire, no doubt they will likely fall within the turn.</p>"
- scene_number: 07
  scene_title: "West African Abandoned"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>A shot of West African shows that Lesotho stopped their build up of units that had propelled them to take so much of the Vandals as they would rather have nothing. An interesting decision, but not likely one to go well here. Marajoara seems posted to walk right through the African heartland. </p>"
- scene_number: 08
  scene_title: "Those Russian Winters…"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>It seems to have somehow gotten colder in Russia as the lands now lay divided between the Chukchi and Marajoara. Unlike North America, this land is far away from both centers, but the Chukchi definitely has the upper hand in ability to reinforce. Which means soon the winds of winter will blow across Europe and another ice age will occur.</p>"
- scene_number: 09
  scene_title: "Green Iran"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>A very empty shot of Lesotho’s northern campaign for the ancient Uzbekistan lands as they forgot they needed to reinforce. Luckily Marajoara does not have many units around either, so Lesotho should have plenty of time to build up defenses. </p><p></p><p>What do you mean I’m missing something? Pssh, what could I possibly be-...</p><p>Oh no</p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "The Former Lands of the King"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>T-T Malacca nooooo… It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Our perfect blue islands now covered in white and purple-ish. So empty of boats too, it’s like they don’t even care about the poor boat craftsmen, sailors, and the culture of the land. I hope at least that we may be put to rest by Kulin getting wiped out because they haven’t built anything.</p><p></p><p>The icons showing the original founders of cities give me some semblance of peace as I can know that Malacca will never truly go away.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "The Mexican Armada"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara is hosting quite a Pacific fleet here, easily enough to fend off the Chukchi’s fleet in the area. Although they are all up around Mexico and there is very little around the islands themselves. Maybe Marajoara is planning an offensive into Kulin Hawaii? It’s hard to say. Either way a lot of boats are going to be sent to the ocean floor.</p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Primarily A Reduced Government"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Did you know nugatory is a word that means “of no value or importance” or “useless or futile”? Well I didn’t until a minute ago when I looked up synonyms for the term tiny and it showed up. Isn’t that cool? You learn something new every day.</p><p></p><p>Actually here’s a second cool thing you get to learn today: PARG is on a one tile island during total war and is about to die. Wait, that wasn’t very cool was it. Well at least you learned one cool thing in Nugatory. </p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Empire of the Southern Shores"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the Marajoaran core, it is quite spooky to be honest, or maybe that’s just me. Actually a lot of those units are non-future worlds so maybe it’s not as bad as I thought. Either way they have a built up core, huge cities, lots of units, ready for the fight. Personally, as a purveyor of the color orange, I gotta support Marajoara in this endgame. Also because the Chukchi attacked Malacca and took their land. I am a petty bitch I’ll admit it. </p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Land of the Nexuses"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah yep, mmm. Oh yeah. That’s terrifying. How many nexuses is that? I’m not going to count, but maybe one of you will. Anyways another fun fact: Did you know that the plural of nexus can be either nexuses or nexus? Ain’t that fun? Word facts! </p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Oh fuck Oh jeez Oh no"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Oh god. Oh jeez. Oh no. Oh fuck. Oh lord. Oh jeez. Oh god. Oh lord. Oh no. Oh fuck. Oh god. Oh no. Oh jeez. </p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "San Nicolás De"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>One turn in and we can see Marajoara take the city in Hawaii that is long and I made a pun of for the title of this slide as well as taking the Big River capital leaving them with just one city. The Chukchi on the other hand have already taken Echaot’l Koe from Marajoara. Good on Big River for surviving for more than a turn though, I sure wasn’t expecting that. </p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Pacific Pontificating"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>P’kuee sends her force straight at N’Dilo, surrounding it while the Chukchi fleet moves south into the Marajoaran Archipelago. In addition, we can see the Chukchi fleet in the north from the bottom of the last slide and a Kulin force surrounding Acholla trying to get in on the fun. One thing of note is that Kulin has 10 planes that we can see while Marajoara has filled their islands with 4 sets of 16 planes, and the Chukchi only have a measly 6 in N’Dilo. </p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Post Actually Real Government"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’m surprised it took 2 turns for them to fall, but Kolchak is finally finding his way to the sub, his attempts to make peace with Lesotho proving unsuccessful at stopping the Chukchi, shocking. PARG had a good run, although if I am to be honest they didn’t do much. They constantly would fight with Great Perm in wars that never went anywhere because of the Urals. They fought with Northern Yuan a lot which was probably their most successful venture, but even then it was a slow process with a lot of pushback that the Chukchi got the majority of the gains of. They also repeatedly fought Uzbekistan and it wasn’t until the very end of Cycle 1 that they made progress there. Their showing in Cycle 2 was one of just fighting some stalematey wars and letting their neighbors get more tech than them. But hey, 7th is a pretty good position to end in. </p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "The Russian North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>In counter to PARG’s swift death, the other civ of the Russian civil war has not even been touched. Marajoara seems a bit distracted with the Chukchi front, so we’ll have to wait to see how long it takes before Kotka and Tiflis fall.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "It all returns to nothing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara takes what I believe is 8 cities off of Lesotho, 3 in west Africa and 5 in the Middle East, pushing directly into that empty core. Honestly Lesotho is on the way out here, they can’t do much to stop the Marajoaran offensive. From here we have to wonder, will owning Africa, Europe, South America, and half of North America be enough for Marajoara to beat the Chukchi? Or will the Chukchi still remain supreme?</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "I see a lot of Nexuses…"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>We get a shot of the Middle East where we can see 4 of the 5 cities that Marajoara took from Lesotho (the fifth is just off screen but the last slide shows it to be Vaga). And that’s all this slide was meant to show, right? Yeah… Nothing else… </p><p></p><p>Oh fuck there are nexuses outside my window they are coming for me please he-!</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Rip Grande"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>While it's the same turn as PARG’s death this slide is later so therefore Big River gets 6th, at least that’s how I’m declaring it. What is quite amusing here is that the single Marajoaran horse with wings unit (actually it seems elsewhere the slide highlights another of the same unit and it’s Airborne Forces, but I like horse with wings unit more) took Dalu Tue, Big River’s final resting place, rather than the large amount of Chukchi units surrounding the city. Anyways, Rio Grande has finally fallen. They got lucky in Cycle 1 because of their defense bug giving them insane defensive values to where their cities couldn’t be touched, but that was fixed in Cycle 2 and now they have finally seen defeat. Marajoara failed to fight them in Cycle 1 because of that bug, but this time they won. Big River had some nice conquests, but ultimately survived so long because of that defensive bug, a solid showing in the end that could’ve been more. </p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Hawaiian Garbage Patch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi fleet surrounding the Hawaiian islands isn’t making much progress on either the Kulin city or the Marajoaran city. My guess would be because of the 42 planes Marajoara and Kulin are wielding, but maybe it’s just the AI being dumb. Either way, there doesn’t seem to really be any reinforcements on the way, at least that we can see. So if this fleet is wiped out then Marajoara gets some well needed safety. </p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Terangganexus"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>I thought I could get away from them but they keep following me oh god I can hear them coming closer. I somehow managed to escape but they are still coming. Went to a new city, thought I was safe now, looked out the window, machines on the horizon. Giant floating machines. I can’t keep running but I need to get out of here!</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Nukus more like Nexus"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho loses more land to Marajoara and Chukchi as the front becomes another in the fight between Marajoara and Chukchi rather than Lesotho. Marajoara is trying to send units to reinforce their new holdings but it may be too late, at least they have been able to make gains in east Africa.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "It all comes tumbling down"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>A better shot of Marajoara’s African gains as they take the former Nigerian capital and two cities in Ethiopia/Sudan. Lesotho still doesn’t have any units to defend themselves, but at least they have some planes. Also I’d like to point out that P’kuee is running a fascist dictatorship, which isn’t the best not gonna lie. </p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "North American FlipFest 2161"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara has managed to take Ciudad Victoria which is impressive (and they retook Echaot’l Koe a turn ago), while Chukchi has taken Dalu Tue. I have no idea what’s going to happen here, but the fact that Marajoara has managed to push through some mountains to take Ciudad Victoria is impressive and shows promise for their future. </p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "The Russian Winter"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s January, and the Chukchi have decided to fully embrace their identity as winter, as they push back Marajoara in Moscow and Tsaritsyn and send a large contingency towards Naantau. Marajoara is trying to send in reinforcements but will it be enough to be able to reinvade Russia in the winter? </p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Polynesian Partaking"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The planes have certainly seemed to win the Pacific battle for Marajoara. They pushed Kulin back and took both Santa Brigida and Pehdzeh Ki, as well as taking N’Dilo off the Chukchi. However, many cities are in red and the Chukchi fleet remains much larger than the Marajoaran one. </p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Tumbling down, tumbling down"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho manages to take back the east African cities but loses more to Marajoara and a Marajoaran fleet pushes up against the southern coast. Also everything in east Africa, not just the retaken cities, are in the black, so they could very easily just be taken. </p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "The most wonderful time of the year"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our main man Goethe himself has given us a list of the world’s most wonderful people. Though he has the gall to put us at 0? The sub? Not cool dude. I need to send someone to kick Goethe off the sub for this, see how he likes swimming in the Antarctic. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Nothing has changed much on this front besides more units on both sides. </p><p></p><p>Don’t think about the nexuses. Don’t think about the Nexuses. Come on Orange, they can’t see you from there, it’s okay, just don’t think about them…</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Deline so fine"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chukchi takes Deline off Marajoara, a pretty massive city. But on the other hand, Marajoara is launching a strong attack on Khioetoa and have cleared up a lot of units around Ciudad Victoria. Neither side looks to have many planes in the area. </p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Landing in the Land Down Under"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kulin has brought some giant death robots to come fight against the Chukchi invasion which has quickly landed on their shores. It’s been a while since Kulin lost any land on the continent (rip Malacca) but it seems Chukchi won’t be stopped. </p><p></p><p>Come on Orange, just breathe, in out in out. *inhales, exhales, inhales exhales*. They aren’t here for you, it’s just Kulin. You don’t like Kulin, it’s fine. Don’t worry. Don’t look outside. You’re safe here…</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Ciudad Conquest"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>I stand corrected on Ciudad Victoria’s safety as Chukchi takes it right back, clearing up Marajoaran units across the front. They also take both of the two Hawaiian cities they couldn’t take earlier. Let’s see if Marajoara can push them back. </p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "You must fight!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Everyone is trying to peace out and we’re not having it. You all need to fight, FOR OUR ENJOYMENT. All of you in this forsaken cylinder are here to appease US. FIGHT GODDAMMIT!</p><p></p><p>Anyways Kulin cities are dropping to red fast, and if I don’t think about the nexuses then they aren’t there. That’s right, not there at all…</p>"

  scene_title: "It all returns to nothing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara pushes into Butha-Bethe, Jos, and Mbuji-Mayi but loses Lubumbashi and Vaga (and I think an island in the east). However, they are bringing quite an assortment of reinforcements and Lesotho still only has planes. Also, I’m trying to do Komm Susser Tod for these Lesotho slides but I’m not reading ahead so I have no idea how long Lesotho will last so I have no idea if the lyrics will fight right. Although you all won’t see that because I’ll edit the slide titles around afterwards to make it fit properly. </p>"

  scene_title: "And-I-Ran"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>Andijan and Nukus fall to the Chukchi as they start bringing in a greater variety of units rather than just nexuses (they can’t see me don’t think about them they can’t see me don’t think about them). Chukchi also surrounds Prizreni as Marajoara have taken back Tsaritsyn, but they will need more units if they want to fully defend against this Siberian invasion.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Tiflost"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>The USSR is down to one city now, and that city is in the black. Next turn they will likely see their end. Chukchi have taken Naantali and Mikkeli too as we see in greater detail Marajoara’s Tsaritsyn counter attack. Looking at the units though, Marajoara seems like they are bringing in more reinforcements than Chukchi, that European production base is helping them a lot. However I have no idea if those eye wing units are good or not compared to Chukchi’s composition. </p>"

  scene_title: "Turkish Invasion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chukchi retakes Tsaritsyn as they also push into Petrograd, Prizreni, and Peje. Marajoara just doesn’t have the units to defend itself against the SIberian horde. It’s like the Mongol invasion in the 1200s pushing into Anatolia and eastern Europe. Though this time it may not end there. </p>"

  scene_title: "Kotka Waiting"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Okay I know I said next turn and it’s two turns later but like how was I supposed to know that the AI wasn’t going to take the city and instead just stand around it for two turns? Or maybe it’s just El Cid somehow keeping them alive. Google says he was a Castillian warlord during the Reconquista, I’m not sure if that will help him here but I’m not one to judge he seems to be doing a fine job. </p>"

  scene_title: "Down Under Drowning"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi take the rest of Indonesia off Kulin and take another continental city. They also push right onto Uluru and damage nearly every Kulin city. There’s not much time left. Also, on the right the Chukchi have taken Caratateua from Marajoara, although I think that happened a few turns ago when we last saw this area. I’d also like to point out that Marajoara took the northern island of New Zealand a turn or two ago and it flipped back to Kulin. </p>"

  scene_title: "Kotka Hiding"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode34-scene46.jpg
  narration: "<p>I can see you there. You’re on the minimap. I know you haven’t fallen yet. I know this slide is supposed to focus on the fall of Nizhniy Novgorod and the weakening of Marajoaran reinforcements, but I’m just upset at Kotka not falling. I feel justified in this. </p>"

  scene_title: "Harcourt Shot"

  narration: "<p>Not much direct progress this turn but the Chukchi push on Port Harcourt and Vaga, although their offensive into Pristina stopped. Marajoara seems more focused on sending units towards Lesotho. Those 16 planes in Caput Vada are going to be a lot of work in this defense. </p>"

Right, the Chukchi are pushing fully into Australia, taking the northern half of the continent. Corandeerk is in the black and there are units around every city. Though it is amusing that they just walked past Marnebek, it seems they didn’t want Uluru just yet. </p>"

  narration: "<p>And with that, 11 turns into total war, the last rump dies. The USSR was an incredible turtle, expanding a bunch early and then turtling. With a few bouts of invasions. They positioned themselves early on as the behemoth of eastern Europe. With a strong showing in Cycle 1, they decided to emulate that in Cycle 2. Once again settling a lot of cities and focusing on science. And with that they pulled off an incredible conquest of Germany, a true blitzkrieg of the blitzkriegers. But alas they couldn’t hold up to the Marajoaran war machine and the SIberian winter, and now they find themselves dead. Welcome to the sub Lenin.</p>"

Though they aren’t sending in more reinforcements, they do have the advantage in planes. But most importantly, Monte Carmelo was founded!

And with that, Kulin is now fully dead. As the Malacca stan, I gotta say I didn’t like Kulin, they got big because Anangu built up a large army but when Kulin attacked they sent the entire army in the ocean for no reason at all allowing Kulin free reign over the continent. They got into a lot of wars with Malacca and although Malacca won like all of them, Malacca couldn’t push very far. Then they did something big and crazy at the end of Cycle 1 by taking all of the Mapuche out and giving themselves a massive power base in South America. Sadly for them, Cycle 2 set them back to their island start, as trying to start settlers in both places just wouldn’t work out (the settlers would all just go on a journey back to Australia iirc). Thus Marajoara was given free reign over a continent and Kulin was back to being cut off from doing anything by Malacca. The fact that they survived longer than Malacca I will never forgive them for though. I am coping and seething rn. They go out in 4th place. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Yes, I know it’s been on the side for the past few slides but the Vandals did get resurrected for the 5th time. I don’t know how turn 754 went as the slides skipped it, but they got resurrected again this turn too. Also, Marajoara has slipped a unit by and taken Teyateyaneng, but Lesotho somehow managed to retake Thaba Tseka off in the lower left corner. Marajoara seems to have forgotten to have any fleets at all, seemingly anywhere. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Pehdzeh Ki gets destroyed as the Chukchi army moves to surround Santa Brigida and Zama. The Chukchi and Marajoara also swap cities in Caratateua and Acholla. And Marajoara looks to settle New Caledonia. Maybe Santa Brigida will get destroyed next turn for some reason and they can found it for the third time. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Yes I do use this joke too much when doing narrations. No, I will not be changing. Here we see how Marajoara has managed to stay so strong despite the Chukchi having 50% more cities. Absolutely insane production. Though this doesn’t explain how Lesotho has anywhere near as much army as they do despite only 3k production. The Vandals, bless them, have 22 production. Remember: They are fourth, not Kulin. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Since we last saw 18 turns ago, Marajoara has gained about 20k soldiers, the Chukchi have lost about 250k, and Lesotho has lost about 40k. I have no idea how Lesotho is surviving this long, they messed up my Komm Susser Tod.</p>"

  narration: "<p>For the final slide of this episode, we get a nice little religious map, showing how dominant the Nigerian, Chukchi, and Marajoaran religions are. Anyways, it has been wonderful to be able to narrate the penultimate episode for all of you guys. Though while narrating my internet did die for a few days and I got covid so it hasn’t been that wonderful, but like, that’s separate. Vandals are gonna win. Peace!</p><p></p><p>The Neutrals are still dead (they’re on a 437 turn streak!). This has been your daily Neutrals update.</p>"
