  narration: "<p>When arriving on the African east coast in Lesotho, Kulin travelers are greeted with a terrifying sight: A horizon filled with Jongs & galleases. Mansur Shah seeks control of all of the Indian Ocean, which will secure his people a powerful position in the global trade network. While Lesotho’s navy is more technologically advanced, their coastal cities aren’t quite productive enough to pump out a sufficient amount of ironclads to defend the coastline. Combine this with the continued Nigerian attacks on their northern borders, and Moshoeshoe’s chances in this war are looking bleaker by the minute.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Red clashes with white in a conflict which shall determine the future of the Russian people. Lenin’s communist revolution is fueled by the production and determination of the working classes, while the All-Russians seek to protect the traditional Russian state with all that they’ve got. The Soviet army has been struggling to get past the Ural mountains for a while now, getting battered by the elements as well as repeated crossbow fire. Meanwhile, Kolchak, an admiral by heart, has been launching powerful naval assaults on Lenin’s polar cities. However, there’s a cold chill going across his spine, as Chukchi warriors patrol PARG’s eastern borders. Kolchak doesn’t want to admit it, but the white army will not be able to fight effectively in a two-front war. He prays that Lawtiliwadlin sets his sights elsewhere.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The people of Central Asia have seen nothing but death and despair throughout the last couple of centuries. They have been caught up in the middle of the petty feuds of empires, having their homes and lands burned down and being replaced with fortresses and citadels, which then also got burned. Now, through the smoke-filled sky, there finally comes a ray of light in the form of a peace deal between All-Russia and Punjab. They might finally be able to return to their pastures and farms and rebuild. But their anxiety stays, as peace never lasts long on the Cylinder.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Obafemi Awolowo is a man of peace and prosperity, always seeking the best for his people. When he declares war, it is out of necessity, as to prevent other world powers from rising and exploiting the Nigerian people. He saw an existential threat in the Vandal thalassocracy as well as the rising star of Lesotho, which is why he decided to take on both foes at once. However, he bit off more than he could chew, as the Vandal fleet and Lesotho’s advanced land armies were more than Nigeria could handle. He then made the mistake of poking the Latin American giant, losing the valuable coastal city of Onitsha by doing so. Now, as to prevent further losses, he decides that it is time to make peace and focus on internal affairs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the music halls of Bibracte, Carl Maria von Weber composes his latest symphony. He realizes that it might be the final song he ever writes. Everyday, he hears news of raids and bombardments on the Gallic overseas territories. City after city falls to the Vandal might, and now those barbarians are starting to encircle the walls of his beloved Bibracte as well. It is almost unimaginable that the once so prosperous and thriving metropole might see its final days under the banner of the golden boar, but alas. The horrors of war come for all.</p>"

  narration: "<p>‘’Lawtiliwadlin, Man-With-The-Neck-Of-A-Bear, destroyer of homes. At the sound of his voice the courage of the strongest fails, and women slay their children so that they may not fall into his hands. His arrows fall like rain.’’ These are the words which echoe all across North America. The Dene tremble in fear upon hearing them, and many families have already fled the cities of K’Agee & Gameti upon hearing the reports of Chukchi warships sailing east. The Chukchi, meanwhile, are encouraged by their leader’s reputation. After all, under his leadership, they have not lost a single war. He is invulnerable, and so are they! The ice will cover all!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mansur slams his fist on the table. ‘’What?! That coward Awolowo has abandoned his war against Moshoeshoe?! That’s not what we agreed on! You know what, disband the operations against Lesotho, at least they defend their lands with bravery. Set sail to Kananga, we’re gonna teach those Yoruba a lesson!’’ ‘’But sir, we basically had them, and the Red Sea is going to be a pain to invade. What about your ambitions to control the entire Indian Ocean? Don’t you think this is a bit illogical?’’ ‘’Whatever, Madagascar is a fine trophy for now. We can always conquer the rest later. This is about pride, this is about setting an example. We must show the world that the great Shah of Malacca is not to be messed with. Send a message to the Jongs, tell ‘em we have a new target.’’ Thus, Malacca gave up on a bunch of sweet and easy Lesotho cities in exchange for a probable boatgrinder. You gotta do what you gotta do, I guess.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Give them a lick, they taste just like raisins. ‘’What’s that?’’ Wilhelm raises his eyebrows in surprise upon reading the front page of the Berlin times. ‘’Vandal forces are surrounding Bibracte and assaulting Valesia, Gallic surrender is imminent. Experts argue they might be coming for the German people next… Ha, what fools, as if they would ever dare to challenge me, the greatest Kaizer who ever lived. If they dare provoke us, my cavalry will crush them underneath their hooves!’’ Suddenly, his mood changes a bit. ‘’Still, sometimes I have this strange feeling, that I should go on the aggressive a little more, create some lebensraum for the German empire, you know? It’s whatever, though. I just haven’t been feeling very conquest-y ever since my beloved Ferdinand died. I should go and take a ride on my horse, that will make me feel better.’’</p>"

  narration: "<p>Genseric, the great king of the Vandals, transformed his people from an insignificant Germanic tribe to a great Mediterranean empire. In his heart, however, he will always remain a warrior and a raider, seeking coin and pleasure by pillaging the wealthy and weak. Thus, when he heard of the imminent conquest of all of Gaul, he decided it was time to step on the breaks. In a speech to his people, he explained his philosophy: ‘’One cannot take the vandalism out of the Vandal. We rely on other civilizations to raid and pillage, so that we can become rich. Thus, if we fully conquer those civilizations, we lose our source of income. It is therefore better to just weaken them a little, give them a little scare. That’s why I’ve decided to let the Gauls live: So they can rebuild and we can raid them again later! In this manner, we create a sustainable economy!’’ All the attendants cheered.</p>"

  narration: "<p>When they heard of Lenin’s recent adoption of the Communist Manifesto, the Provisional All-Russian Government decided that they should also put their ideals on paper. Thus, on the glorious day that Krasnodar was taken by the white navy, Kolchak announced to the world that he was now pursuing the ideals of fascism! All those who would point out that he had already been kind of a fascist for his entire life, were silenced.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A bummer for Awolowo. He had just made peace with all his foes, and now another shows up in the form of his former ally. Luckily, those Malaccan ships will have trouble getting to any of his cities, as the Gulf of Aden as well as the Red Sea are filled with advanced Nigerian vessels. Suddenly, he remembers something. ‘’Oh shoot, I had just sent a settling expedition to build a city on the Horn of Africa last week, because I thought that would be a pretty location. I hope that won’t cause any trouble…’’</p>"

  narration: "<p>A Kulin explorer has been sent to scout out the lands of the Chukchi. ‘’It is truly terrifying.’’ he writes. ‘’It’s freezing cold out here, but the warriors don’t seem to feel it. Every city is enforced with a well-outfitted garrison, despite the sheer size of the Chukchi empire. Furthermore, the seas are absolutely carpeted with warships, almost like a naval traffic jam. The tales of these people were not exaggerated, and I pray that my homeland of Australia will never have to see their wrath.’’ </p>"

  narration: "<p>Peace fully returns to the Middle East, as Genseric decides to call off Vandal raids on Nukus. ‘’We shouldn’t bother them any longer, they’ve been through enough.’’ In response to this noble deed, he is given the Wholesome Award by the Vandal people. Mannerheim, however, isn’t buying it and decides to denounce the snaky king.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mannerheim was right not to trust Genseric: It seems his real motive for peace was to form a fascist alliance with Kolchak. To seal the deal, Kolchak makes peace with the Gauls, following Genserics example.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Despite his new diplomatic alliance, things aren’t looking so hot for Kolchak. Due to their official adoption of communism, the Soviet Union has entered a Golden Age. Fueled by renewed ambition, the Red Army has upgraded their military, retaken Krasnodar and started to push for Samara once again. Meanwhile, the whites are looking almost medieval, still sporting trebuchets, pikemen and crossbows. If Kolchak doesn’t invest some more into technological advancements, All-Russia will soon become No-Russia. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Soviets seem to really be doing it this time! Already, their swift horsemen are shooting at the walls of Samara, with more troops to come. The Red Army is really investing in upgrading their weaponry: While a few musketmen still walk the lands, the first riflemen are already appearing. With just a little more artillery, they might be able to really turn the tide of this war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>An All-Russian explorer lands on the Horn of Africa, to test his hypothesis that levels of horniness in people are affected by the horniness of the place they live in. To his frustration, he cannot measure a significant effect. Rather than that, he measures a high concentration of Jong in close proximity. ‘’Maybe I should write my research on that.’’ he ponders.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Geopolitical tensions rise in the South China Sea, as Lawtiliwadlin denounces the Malaccan government. Mansur Shah isn’t too worried: ‘’You may not like it, but the Jong is the perfect warship. The Chukchi could never touch that. No matter what scientists may say, no better ship will ever be invented. All those tales about a mysterious underwater ship laying in the Arctic circle are obvious fantasy too. Could you imagine that, an underwater ship? How could it sail without wind? Ridiculous.’’</p>"

  narration: "<p>One man’s loss is another man’s gain. After the Chukchi burned the city down, an opportunistic Dene settler seeks to establish a new settlement on the ruins of K’Agee. The settler hopes that the Chukchi will not go out of their way to attack a young and small community, but knowing their cruelty, it seems unlikely. The city of Gameti is also occupied by the icy navy. The citizens can count themselves relatively lucky, as Lawtiliwadlin decides that this place is worth keeping around.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Punjabi lands are looking somewhat dystopian: Between the gray peaks of the Himalayan mountains lie dozens of fortresses, which are guarded by menacing artillery battalions. However, the Sikhs who inhabit these lands don’t seem to mind. In fact, Ranjit Singh leads his people into a new Golden Age, increasing wealth, production and cultural outbursts all across his holy empire. It remains to be seen if this period will actually help the Sikhs in the long run though, as Punjab is surrounded by powerful neighbors who would surely love to take a bite of that juicy orange someday.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The homie Alberti has completed his list of the mostest literate nations in the world, and is proud to present it to the people of the sub. Turns out that having a whole jungle-filled continent to oneself and barely any wars to focus one’s production on helps to greatly boost technological efforts within one’s empire. Nigeria being in second place is hardly surprising too, as Awolowo is known to facilitate an excellent educational environment for his people. The Punjabi are also going strong - it seems the Sikh scientists are profiting from the current Golden Age of Punjab.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The people of Samara wave the red flag (not the white one, that would be offensive) and open the gates to let the Soviet soldiers in. ‘’It was surprisingly easy’’ writes the commander of the Red Cavalry Regiment. ‘’Barely any resistance. We just shot a few rounds with our cannons, and the defenders surrendered. The rest of the war is looking promising as well. Bar the occasional caravan, the Siberian plains look very empty. My men cheer, as they can already see the skylines of Namangan and Omsk on the horizon. Victory over the whites comes closer by the minute. For Marx, Lenin & the motherland! Glory to the revolution!’’ In a panicked frenzy, Kolchak sends Ma Hushan, one of his most esteemed strategists, to the frontline. But remember this, kids: A general without an army is like a fish without gills - he won’t be doing much anytime soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>During times of prosperity, one can focus on the good things in life. Ranjit Singh, who has grown tired of the busy city life in Lahore, now dreams of a secluded yet luxurious life in the mountains. Immediately, he orders his workers to start constructing a summer residence for him and his family in the peaks of the Himalayas. ‘’Oh, and make it in the style of those German castles in which my good enemy Wilhelm likes to dwell. They always give off such a romantic aura, I simply múst have one for myself.’’</p>"

  narration: "<p>To no one’s surprise, Kaiser Wilhelm has taken a liking to the fascist way of doing things. In an interview with the Berlin Times, Wilhelm explains his choice: ‘’I just love dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and the economy, you know? It really speaks to me.’’ The adoption of fascism by the German empire does have significant geopolitical effects, as this makes Germany an ideological ally of PARG and an opponent of the Soviet Union. If Wilhelm ever decides to help out his All-Russian brethren, things could get very interesting…</p>"

  narration: "<p>The opportunistic Dene settler proudly plants his flag on the shores of the Canadian west coast. ‘’I shall call this settlement K’Agee, in honor of those who lived here before.’’ Suddenly, he feels a hand on his shoulder. It’s an officer of the Chukchi navy, who demands that he gives himself over to the government in Kagyrgyn. With his dreams crushed, the settler is shackled and sent to a gulag in Siberia. Further along the coast, Chukchi frigates are bombarding Ciudad Victoria. Their land forces are still far behind though, allowing the battered city to stay in Dene hands for a while longer. This doesn’t give Thanadelthur a sense of security, however, as Chukchi vessels have also entered the Arctic Ocean, and have started raiding the northernmost Dene cities.</p>"

  narration: "<p>During these times of rapidly rising ideologies, the Tagai religion of the Kulin undergoes a structural reformation. William Barak, not knowing what to do with all the leftover swords from the medieval period, has a brilliant idea: Melt them down and turn them into plowshares! He orders religious figures all across Australia to gather their communities and follow his example. The result is a massive increase in agricultural productivity all across the Kulin lands. Vladimir Lenin sends a letter of admiration to Barak, in which he expresses his hope that William will also add in some hammers and sickles at a later point.</p>"

A visiting Chukchi explorer raises his eyebrows: ‘’I mean, it is a lovely canal, but is it really necessary? After all, there is a perfectly fine river system next to Gajranwala. Isn’t that enough for trade vessels to sail inland? Who knows, maybe I’m just too Chukchi to understand.’’</p>"

  narration: "<p>Moshoeshoe I is a lucky man and a cunning diplomat. With his dashing tophat and his exaggerated swagger he has been able to talk even his most formidable foes into unlikely peace deals, even putting his former enemies in the form of Malacca and Nigeria against one another. Lesotho isn’t out of the race just yet: Its people are fairly literate and its neighbors distracted. A precise strike during a moment of weakness may allow Moshoeshoe to capture some lovely cities from either of his neighbors. Thus, he just lies back for now, waiting for a moment of opportunity. </p>"

This doesn’t bode well for any potential future conflicts with Marajoara, as the latter have a sizable and advanced navy within the Caribbean. In order to achieve anything, Antonio would have to embark his land units on a trip to Colombia, making them vulnerable to bombardments from both land and water.

  narration: "<p>It hasn’t been too long since the Gallic wars, but Genseric is already thirsting for gold again. With his newfound fascist brethren to his north and east, he only sees one potential raiding target: The Nigerian lands to the south. He orders his men to take up their arms and cross the border, believing that victory will once again be his. However, Baba Awolowo saw this coming. Before the declaration of war, he ordered his generals to fill the Sahara desert with cavalry regiments. Now, the sounds of thousands of hooves can be heard, as cavalry swiftly storm the cities of Cirta & Catina. The latter is already being besieged from multiple sides, as field cannons fire at its walls. This is a gamble for Awolowo, as his cavalry will be weaker than the Vandal riflemen in the long run. He therefore hopes to quickly capture some cities and force a panicked Genseric into a peace deal.</p>"

After all, his empire wasn’t in any imminent danger from the Jong fleet. Mansur, meanwhile, does a little dance around his table. ‘’That’ll teach them, that’ll teach them! I told you we would get to the Red Sea, now look at this lovely city we’ve got! Much better than any of Lesotho’s ugly coastal cities. Stupid advisors, always doubting my every decision. This should teach you to have some respect for the great Shah of Malacca!’’ His advisors sigh and exit the room, leaving the man to his self-centered frolicking. </p>"

Genseric made a bit of a miscalculation, as Nigeria has barely any coastal cities for the massive Vandal fleet to capture. Meanwhile, the Vandal land army isn't much to write home about. However, if his fleet were to sail around West Africa and directly assault Lagos, the loot would most definitely be plentiful.</p>"

This city will be hard for the Nigerians to occupy in the long term, as dozens of Vandal ships lie waiting in the Mediterranean Sea, ready to strike upon any unsuspecting Yoruba.

Vandal troops are landing in the Western Sahara, attempting to recapture their beloved Catina, while advanced Lesotho infantry units patrol the borders of the two green nations.

  narration: "<p>As expected, the crazy horse was not able to prevent Kano from being captured. When the city was taken, Vandal soldiers slaughtered the horse and ground it into meatballs, as to lower the morale amongst the Nigerian troops. In response, angry troops of cuirassiers surround the city, ready to avenge their fallen general. However, their focus should probably be on defending Lagos, as its walls are already crumbling. If Awolowo wants to prevent the upcoming humanitarian catastrophe from happening, he’ll have to start evacuating the Lagotian citizens quickly!</p>"

  narration: "<p>The war between the North and South is surprisingly even so far, with both empires not really making any real progress in terms of conquest. The Marajoara have, with a little help from Germany, managed to destroy all Rio ships off the North American east coast. Sadly for them, a lost Vandal fleet is blocking the way, preventing any potential attacks on Rio’s coastal cities from happening. The citizens of both nations begin to wonder: Will all this bloodshed even have a point in the end?</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a daring operation, German officials order the construction of a belt of citadels deep into the Soviet Baltics, cutting off Nizhniy Novgorod from the rest of the Union. This newly acquired land could prove instrumental in a potential Soviet-German war, as it would allow for a swift attack on Moscow. Lenin curses the Germans for their brash behavior, but Wilhelm justifies his actions: ‘’These lands have historically belonged to our Teutonic ancestors, and have since been stolen by the greedy Russian. It’s only right that we take it back, and we did so with no violence being involved at that. Clearly, what happened on this day is just, not just for the Germanic people, but for the world.’’</p>"

  narration: "<p>For the first time ever, GeneralCon is being held in Punjabi territory! Great generals from all over the Cylinder flock to Gajranwala to discuss their histories, tactics and strategies, so as to inspire and entertain one another! Right now, hailing from the lands once known as Taiping, we have commander Chiang Kai Shek. Let’s hear what he has to say! ‘’The key to a successful army is the purity of its ideology. Political dissidents, like the communist dog, will only weaken the morale and sabotage an army’s effectiveness. It is therefore of the utmost importance that such enemies of the state be driven out as swiftly as possible, by any means necessary!’’ Upon hearing these words, many attendees start cheering enthusiastically, but some of the Kulin and Soviet generals seem less excited. One has to wonder why…</p>"

  narration: "<p>Next up is Napoleon Bonaparte! This renowned general from the lands of Gaul is such a natural leader, that one wonders why he has never ruled his own empire. Perhaps in a past life! Now let’s be silent, Napoleon is going to speak. ‘’The people of the world should put their faith in the strong and gifted, not blindly submit their freedoms to anyone who just so happened to be born into a specific bloodline! Even a peasant or an outsider should be able to become a leader, as long as they prove themselves on the battlefield! Let the worthy be kings, and dethrone the weak! That’s how the world should be ruled!’’ This time, the Kulin and Soviet generals seem quite touched, but many of the other commanders look the other way. Once again, one has to wonder why…</p>"

  narration: "<p>Lawtiliwadlin is becoming quite frustrated. ‘’How could this be, our military might is so much greater than the Dene’s, yet we barely have any results to show for it! I can see it in the enemy’s eyes: My warriors terrify those cowardly Dene. So why do they still resist so heavily, why do they not let their guns fall to the ground in pure terror?! Why do they still march upon my armies, knowing full well that it is futile in the end?! Argh, this baseless tenacity is such a pain!’’ On this day, the Chukchi have learned a valuable lesson: Even if you’re stronger than your opponent, you still have to put in the effort to actually defeat them. Even the greatest powers in the world won’t get results without trying. Let this serve as a wholesome lesson to the youth all across the Cylinder.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Before the coast of Lagos lies a mighty vandal fleet, commanded by Calonymus of Alexandria. Formerly an enemy of the Vandal kingdom, Calonymus was taken into captivity after a failed Egyptian uprising against the Vandal state. King Genseric, however, recognized the Alexandrian’s skilled leadership on the open seas, and offered him a position in his own fleet. This decision turned out to be a wise one, as Calonymus quickly rose in the Vandal ranks and is now about to lead the Vandal fleet into perhaps their biggest victory ever: The capture of Lagos. If he manages to have one of his own ships capture the city, his name will surely be remembered for all eternity!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Lawtiliwadlin plants his mighty spear in the ground in front of the High Priestess. "I'm tired of this endless back and forth, so I've come to negotiate. How about you just give me your empire, and nobody gets hurt. How does that sound?" Thanadelthur looks down at the ground, trembling in the presence of the man before her.  "Actually… all of it is a little much. Would you maybe be satisfied with half of it?" The Chukchi warlord grunts in displeasure, but ultimately gives in: "I don’t have time for this. Fine, half it is. But heed my words: War will certainly come to your lands again. Your people will never be able to sleep soundly again, knowing that the Dene empire has gone from a powerful bear to a helpless fawn, a prey item to the nations of the world. Go then, back to your people, prepare yourselves for the inevitable." The Dene councilors shiver at the words of the mighty Chukchi. Thanadelthur starts tearing up. She knows he speaks the truth. The Dene people’s best days are in the past.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a camp outside of Lagos, Genseric and his generals are preemptively celebrating their capture of the Nigerian capital, when they are suddenly interrupted by a man on horseback. The stranger jumps off his mount and throws himself to the ground. It’s Awolowo himself, draped in gray robes. ‘’Please, king Genseric, spare the city of Lagos. My people have been through enough, and it is clear that we will not be able to hold the walls much longer. I see the looks in the eyes of your Vandals, oh king, and I shiver at the thought of the unspeakable acts that they will commit within my beloved city. So I beg you, please spare Lagos. I’ll give you anything I own!’’ Genseric’s eyes start shining, and a broad smile appears on his face. ‘’Anything, you say?’’ On that day, the city of Lagos was spared by the benevolent Genseric. Also on that day, the once mighty Nigerian empire was reduced to a mere city state. </p>"

  narration: "<p>One might not believe it, but the Chukchi have managed to turn their snow and tundra-based empire into a manufacturing powerhouse. When it comes to productivity, no empire on the Cylinder is even close to the Bering Bois, with the constantly expanding Vandals and the jungle juggernaut Marajoara in second and third place respectively.  Doesn’t Lawtiliwadlin know that close competition creates a healthy business environment?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Some truly shocking results, as it turns out that the Chukchi also have the strongest military in the world. At least the numbers are a little closer here: On paper, a grand coalition war against the Chukchi should be able to take them down a notch. Their fearsome reputation, excellent production and amazing strategic position on the map will almost certainly mean that such a thing never actually happens, though. The only hope left for the other leaders of the Cylinder is that Lawtiliwadlin goes into a long hibernation, giving other empires the chance to rise in power. If not, they’d better be prepared for a global cooling event…</p>"

It sure was something, with all those bizarre twists and turns. Hopefully my strange fantasies about the lore of the Cylinder sufficiently entertained you, as it certainly was a lot of fun to come up with them. Anyways, time for some cliché life advice to end things off with. Live laugh love. Goodbye.</p>"
