  narration: "<p>Hello everybody and welcome to the 25th installment of the civ battle royale episode 25, I am your host Rosay. You may remember that I was one of the people that wrote for Episode 23, or as a part of the Power Ranking team. My first experience with narrating a portion of an episode was really fun and I'm excited to do it again.</p>"

  narration: "<p>You know, I’ve always wondered why the AIs always tend to follow similar pathways, like nobody ever settles northern japan, and there's always some really unexpected civ in Greenland (except for next cycle praise the newly elected Greenland for its region).</p>"

  narration: "<p>Marajoara continues to be the top place civ according to the power rankers (me included) and it's hard to argue considering all of the successful civs in the past that have come out of the region, which mind you Marajoara controls entirely. </p><p></p><p>With all that out of the way, let's jump in and watch some AIs throw hands!</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We begin the episode with some insight into the systems of government put in place for this world, being a lot more advanced than the simple Freedom-Order-Autocracy triangle. While I'm not entirely sure about the individual modifiers that each of these government types provide, I do like how they alot more flavor to the cylinder. Looking at the slide, governments for the civs are mostly populist republics or religious states. The vandals are a clear exception with their traditional monarchy run via nobility. There is also the holy heavenly kingdom, which is one hell of a mouthful.</p>"

  narration: "<p>There seems to be a bit more variety here, with an entirely neutral military dictatorship, Malaccan merchants, and a Kulin hoard. The rest of the relevant civs in this slide are populist republics, along with the theocracy on Punjab</p>"

  narration: "<p>Capping off the governmental slides, Parg is really mixing things up with a celestial dynasty and somehow both the Gauls and Chukchi have adopted a weird form of monarchic-socialism where the common folk are the primary influencers</p>"

  narration: "<p>For our first full photo of the cylinder, we cut to the Northern Yuan war. Ikh Khuree is in a vulnerable position, being in the yellow and with melee units in range of the city. Parg has also begun its assault on Shangdu, though the assault is much slower due to bad terrain. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Malacca and Punjab have both declared war on Taiping, each civ trying to be the one that excommunicates the heavenly kingdom from the cylinder. My money is on Malacca, just all of Punjab’s units near Jintian are ranged units, and while Malacca isn't exactly a sword and pike fest, at least they have units that can actually take a city</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>As one war begins another ends. Dene and Malacca have reached a peace agreement with Chukchi. Malacca definitely ended up alright, getting a few islands in the pacific, such as Kei’i’yergyn, and Dene ended up in more or less the same position. </p>"

  scene_title: "Two remain"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile in Africa, the wall between the two powerhouses of Africa has been lifted, and all that's left is an inevitable conflict between two green African empires. Lesotho definitely has a more advanced military, along with a balanced set of units, so they have an edge when war inevitably hits.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Rio Grande soldiers have arrived at Quinaoutatoua, most likely as fodder. Meanwhile, the mostly clean frontline in the western United States really highlights the magnitude of the Dene citadel spam.</p>"

  scene_title: "Methodical advancements"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Parg seems to be struggling to take Shangdu, yet the white flood continues to roar into the city, and eventually, we may see the city take some damage. In the north Khovd enters the red, with the Chukchi ice sheet fleet somehow being more effective than the entire Parg military. Chukchi has also made peace with the THK, turning the three man race into a two man one.</p>"

  scene_title: "The hermit jungles"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara’s carpet is a bit off. While the ground military is more or less non-existent, its navy is decently armed. Though since Marjoara is essentially isolated from the rest of the world, with invasion from Rio Grande or Kulin being more or less impossible, the lack of a proper military is essentially a non-issue, at least for now while naval war is not exactly viable.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With the Neutral’s, Uzbekistan’s, and Finland's militaries being the smallest non-doomed nations. Taiping’s military is actually smaller than the singular observer sub, which is never a good sign</p>"

  scene_title: "This fire burns."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of militaries, Chukchi certainly knows how to use them. In the course of a turn, Chukchi has taken two cities, and has immediately decided to burn them both down. My best guess is that Chukchi is having happiness problems, which raises the question of why the hell did Chukchi wage a war where they cant gain anything. Additionally, Northern Yuan has built the Himeji castle, which may actually save the surviving Yuan from annexation. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Whoa momma, Lesotho out here looky beefy as all hell. With a dummy thicc core looking to get dummy thiccer, Lesotho is looking like an increasingly dangerous threat. Admittedly a lot of the units inside of Lesotho are non-combat units, but even ignoring those, their carpet is still impressive.  </p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Fallen Heavenly Kingdom"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca has successfully taken out one more civ from the game, that being the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. The Heavenly Kingdom was admittedly a somewhat unremarkable nation, where despite a strong early showing, never struck at the opportunities given to it. There was hope that Cycle 2 would be better, but the Heavenly kingdom never took the chance to try and do better the second time. I honestly wish I could write more about the Heavenly Kingdom’s journeys led by a crackhead who thought he was the brother of Jesus, but unfortunately he was just not very interesting in the civ timeline. F</p><p></p><p>Also Chukchi took Choir.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Scrolling back to PARG and OH COME ON SERIOUSLY. Parg was beginning to rally the troops to take Shangdu and as soon as the troops were in range, peace was declared. At least Chukchi has less competition. </p>"

  scene_title: "Niagara stumbles"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rio Grande sends a troop of units to Niagara, and this set actually looks strong enough to take the city, with a steady size of melee ships and two composite bowmen to weaken the city to make a capture possible. </p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "And they dont stop coming and they dont stop coming and…"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Damn another golden age, sub must be on fire this time of year which is a really bad thing saying out loud. </p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "War, your regularly scheduled program."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Just gonna slide that to the side real quick and, oh god help us all, we got a war. Admittedly it's hard seeing Nigeria v Malacca going too far, considering that all of Nigeria’s coastal cities are fairly far away or stuck in the red sea, blocked by Lesotho</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Uzbotchistan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Looking over at what was once considered a potential game winner, man Uzbekistan is disappointing, being reduced to a rump state, doomed to fall behind its neighbors. I mean, just look at their smallest city, the people are just begging to be nuked.</p>"

  scene_title: "u/Orange containment project"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca is the victim of a joint coalition, two members of which actually matter. The first and obvious one is Kulin, which will likely be the main focus of the war. Looking at what we have, Malacca looks to have the advantage and will likely take a few islands, however Kulin is also likely to reunify the continent. The second relevant war from this coalition is Lesotho. As seen back on slide 27, Malacca can actually attack Lesotho, due to being able to enter deep waters. Honestly, maybe Lesotho shouldn't have joined this war, cause they appear to have nothing to gain. </p>"

  scene_title: "Niagara falls"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Niagara is officially under Rio Grande control, and is promptly being burned to the ground, with the Neutral soldiers being unable to stop it. Quinaoutatoua is also in trouble, being deep in the red. Thankfully, the surrounding units are all ranged, thus being unable to take the city. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Malacca appears to have the advantage on the Australian coast, as all Kulin Naval units are unable to support the siege effort in Marpeang Balug. A single Kulin swordsman has been stranded from the fighting and hopes to land in Indonesia to not die. Naval skirmishes are also happening around Rokan though there's currently not enough units to take a city, unless Kulin were to pull some troops from up north. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chukchi has appeared to have stopped razing the Northern Yuan captures, meaning that they likely fixed any potential happiness issues. Additionally, all of the captured cities appear to be secured except for maybe Choir, though favorable terrain might just protect the city.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode25-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Quinaouatoua has reached deep black health, meaning that if as much as a single man with a sharp stick were to walk in, they'd take the city with no resistance. Up further north the naval bombing of Aondironon is advancing swimmingly. The Neutrals have sent a second force in hopes of reconquest. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Meanwhile across the pond, The Vandals have declared war on the Gauls. While we have seen that the Vandals undisputedly have the largest military on the cylinder, nearly all of that is based in the sea. If the Vandals get a stable place to land their troops however, we may see another elimination.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Germany has locked down Greenland, with a surprising amount of people moving in. This is still likely a technological hindrance however, as technologies in civ 5 are becoming harder to get when more cities are created. Though with a 9 pop city on greenland of all places, this could change surprisingly quickly. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Malaccan navy has retreated from Marpeang, potentially seeing it as a lost cause to the Kulin actual horde, and instead has focused their effort on a city even harder to say, Eumemmerring. Up north Kulin has locked down eastern Indonesia and is positioned to keep it that way.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Lilybaeum is currently the sole front of this Gaulic-Vandal war, likely to only take any real damage from ranged ships until a melee unit can come in to secure the landing. Looking into the Gaulic core, there are alot of horsemen, which may actually result in them being unable to take the city back. Horsemen do very little damage to cities, and an army with them as the only melee units is not exactly optimal. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Vandals have officially landed units on the Iberian coast. This is where the Gaulic empire is really going to start feeling stressed, because now the Vandals can begin a proper land invasion, instead of taking potshots from the sea.

All of the Rio Grande units are either gone or dispersed and the city literally flipped twice in the course of a turn (you can tell because the city is at half health). Welp sorry Rio Grande, you’re going to need yet another set of troops to try again. Hell, maybe Dene’s war declaration might distract the Neutrals long enough for you to keep the city this time. </p>"
