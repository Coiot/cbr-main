The cities of Nodena, Fox Farm and Atahachi are currently at the forefront of the attack, and judging by the choice of Siege units as the main attacking force of choice, Tuskaloosa may wish to swiftly reconsider their strategy.  We also get a good glimpse of The Dene's carpet of Infantry, Paratroopers and Anti-Aircraft ready to be deployed when needed.</p><p></p><p>I would also like to know where that Gallic settler in Dene territory is heading to.</p>"

In another case of “dumb as hell peace deals towards civs that possess absolutely no threat to you whatsoever,” the Olmecs have given up Papaloapan, one of their two remaining cities, to Palmares, confirming their membership into the city-state club. Then again, considering this “city” is arguably nothing more than a hobo camp within a Marajoaran fortress, I’d say it wasn’t THAT bad of a loss.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile Zanzibar actually has a meaningful presence in their war with Rio Grande as they trade blows alongside their Marajoaran allies.
