    narration: "<p>Lines of men dressed in two different shades of green stood between the bombed out ruins of Kurdistan and the Zairan military, between Zaire and victory. That Zaire brought nothing but airpower, Zairepower as the soldiers took to saying, made the matter easier; one of the principal faults of peace corps around the cylinder was always that their men were restless to a fault, and sometimes, their wandering let an enemy sneak through the lines.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Carlos sat in his Sevillan office, sipping anís. He already knew what the messenger has to say. Salamanca had fallen. How the hell couldn’t it? It was line infantry fighting tanks; galleases against battleships. This war was lost when it began. His musicians played songs of the days before, when Spanish naval might went toe-to-toe with the Gauls and held its own, his priests pondered what sins led Spain to this point, and he bemoaned the fact that collectively, musicians and missionaries almost outnumbered his remaining land forces.</p>"

    narration: "<p>On the beaches of Bottle Creek, a peculiar scene played out. Five divisions of Paraguayan Parajumpers and an Armatan Arbalast unit claimed refuge on this island in the frozen north. The refugees outnumbered the local Mississipian forces by quite a bit, but most importantly, their camps filled up all the space available to them such that the heavy vehicles of the Dene invaders couldn’t make landfall without destroying them. Such an act of unprovoked violence on a group of refugees was utterly unthinkable even in the violent hellscape of the Cylinder; at least not without a formal declaration of war. </p><p></p><p>Thanadelthur, leader of the Dene, flexed a pen in frustration. She couldn’t exactly declare war on a people with no cities, no actual office to receive the war declaration. Worse, these refugees literally have nowhere else to go, trapped within closed borders. She had an aide bring her to speed on events in someone else’s lands. A distraction, someone else’s misery. That aide began running through the stagnant Zairan invasion of Kurdistan. Her mind began to wander.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Elsewhere, with her efforts focused on finishing off a longtime rival, the Malaccan front stalemated. The only breakthrough forces in theater were a handful of Dene armored railguns just outside of Tibahanga and a Malaccan XCOM just north of Yaanga. Airpower favored the Malaccans, but a perilous portion of that power was parked in Juyubit, a city on the verge of flipping and in range of that aforementioned railgun. The city would almost certainly flip back, but those planes would still be scuttled.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Cylinder had another navally-oriented southern Pacific frontrunner civ beyond Malacca, the Kulin. Australia was standing room only right now; flush to the brim with hybrid drones and parajumpers. A naval landing would be a bloodbath for the invader, even ignoring the Kulin air and naval forces.</p><p></p><p>Just outside the continent, in the city of Hilo, Liliuokalani made a stand, one not of arms but of morals. Denouncing the fascistic bloodlust of her neighbors, she incorporated Permisian ideas of liberal democracy, of citizen election, government by and for the people. A missive came in from the USSR. It reads only, “How well did this go for Perm?” Liliuokalani nodded solemnly, and returned to her work.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The defenses of Sevilla lay in shambles. Salamanca was a beachhead. Carlos thought back to eons past, to when all this started, to when he was a frontrunner. It all started so well. A news report showed tales of missionaries gunned down in the streets by Gaulish tanks, of the navy collapsing to just a caravelle and a work boat. He requested his butler fetch more booze.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Nasni was the pilot of a Dene stealth bomber based out of Mound Bottom. Her daily routine consisted of maintaining training with new techniques to bomb Bottle Creek, working out to stay within military regulation fitness so she can bomb Bottle Creek, piloting the plane to Bottle Creek to bomb it, and wondering why the hell she’s still bombing Bottle Creek. The Mississippi were already effectively dead, she figured, and there was no way any of the ground forces were getting through the refugee camps without causing an international clusterfuck. To say nothing of all the helicopters and vertols in the nearby Dene forces that couldn’t occupy ground in the first place! It cost a fat pound of gold to keep her bird flying, and an even fatter one to pay for the munitions she drops on that crater of a city. What the hell was it all for at this point?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Carlos the third, Carlos the last, fled Sevilla for the Vandal border as the last wave of Gallic forces advanced into his last city. His last ships sunk or captured, his last combat capable division stayed behind to cover his flight. There would be no defiant last stand, no great flipfest. He pondered at how this all went so wrong. </p><p></p><p>He was the first to really get his national engine going, the first to fully claim his core region. While others were ruined by their geography, he claimed a fortress of a region. And yet somehow, it wasn’t enough. Spain stagnated, trapped in the very fortress that should have made it defensible. Amphibious assaults from the Vandals crippled him, leaving him a scrap, someone else’s meal, someone else’s diplomatic disaster. And now someone else is finishing that meal.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious stranger met him partway, and brought him to the submarine. He heard her curse under her breath, “Damn, I really thought Mississippi would die first.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>Awolowo made an impassioned speech on behalf of his faith, and how embracing it globally could only make the world a better place. Everyone else listened politely, before immediately vetoing the resolution.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Kaiser Wilhelm, having had a bout of bad itchiness on his glove hand, blamed it on the cotton fibers and thus decided that the Fluff Devil must be banned.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Malacca’s control over Juyubit fliped back and forth, costing Mansur Shah nine whole airframes. The Dene also took Puvunga, although without much in the way of remaining breakthrough forces to take it back should the Malaccan navy do its job.</p>"

    narration: "<p>“My people, it is time for us to finish the great work we began so long ago. Burkina Faso must be finished.” Awolowo’s forces were already ready to descend upon their eternal foe before the television crews even arrived to record his speech. The Burkinan megalopolis of the desert stood no chance. Millions would die today.</p><p></p><p>Thanadelthur examined the report closely, before examining the scene. Just like herself, Nigeria was about to execute a longtime rival, but something was different. All of Sankara’s forces in theater this time were his own, unlike the last Burkina-Nigeria war, unlike Tuskaloosa. Last time, the ‘peacekeepers’ were his salvation, this time, there were no such saviors handy. It was as if some cosmic force was punishing weak states for building militaries of their own.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In a single year, the entire Burkinan military was destroyed. As he followed the strange woman who offered him escape, Sankara too thought of what had gone so terribly wrong.</p><p></p><p>He too had begun strong, with a powerful early spread that looked to dominate North Africa with sheer density of cities- but then that bastard Awolowo swept in and ruined everything. It was all his fault. He smashed into Burkina Faso before they were able to build up a military force to protect their fledgling empire, and killed their early lead. From there, he could only stagnate, able to sometimes threaten the Ptolomies when they turned their back to focus on eastern matters, until a disastrous pair of sequential wars against the Vandals and Nigeria left him a broken runt of an empire. </p><p></p><p>As he arrived at the sub, he met Carlos in the waiting room. Carlos simply nodded in a strange camaraderie, two men who could have been contenders, and offered some smuggled booze. Sankara accepted it.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In a desperate attempt to impress his mother, Kaiser Wilhelm II declared war upon Sweden; “Look mother! I can command a mighty navy just as strong as your homeland! Even through a narrow channel that might well be blocked by those insufferable peacekeepers, I shall finish what I started in Sweden so many years ago!”</p><p></p><p>His generals rolled their eyes in private, but were happy to finally be fighting someone other than Ferdinand for once.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Swedish corvette Najadan sailed by Kulin Lima in desperate search for port, half a sail remaining, two thirds of the crew slain by the newfound enemies of her homeland. The crew could see a German privateer on the horizon. They knew their days were numbered.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Kulin Lima, the Kulin generals surveyed their situation. Should a total war come, they had force superiority in theater. Their forces spilled deeply into the Marajoaran lands, to say nothing of their naval forces. Meanwhile, Malacanan Tacna had no forces stationed to speak of. The generals weren’t foolish men, they weren’t going to count these unhatched eggs as chicken, but they liked their odds.</p>"

    narration: "<p>A division of Paraguayan parajumpers pushed deep into the strange, futuristic structures, seeking any refuge they could find from the fire sent their way. They had no idea who the hell was shooting them, or from where, or most aggravatingly, why. They had to leave comrades dead on the road in a land as far as is physically possible from their home, and they didn’t even know why. Such is the life of the refugee soldier.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Wilhelm giggled himself silly at the thought of having stolen privateers, before congratulating his soldiers in an overly long speech that, despite going on for hours, failed to really address much of the actual contributions of any of the actual fighting men, but somehow found space for a dig at his mother and her “stupid Britain.” A soldier was heard asking, “What the fuck is a Britain?” An officer shrugged.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, P’kuee sent Tamar an apology. “Sorry, thought you were a region in Vandal occupied North America. Peace?” Tamar rolled her eyes and accepted the treaty.</p>"

Wilhelm wrote his mother a fawning letter about how good he was doing at warlording and how she should really be quite impressed by it and hold his hands softly. She sent the letter back with its grammar corrected.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Karl was messy crying into a pair of cat ears.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Hetu Ala should not stand. It is a fortress of glass; fragile, indefensible. Yet so long as a single peacekeeper occupies the tile, no-one can break it. Right now, that peacekeeper is Georgian. Thanadelthur took notes. A pathetic runt of a power was still managing to disrupt wars by just building more troops than she could house. As she signed a peace treaty with the Malaccans, letting them keep their Californian holdings, she started to compile those notes.</p><p></p><p>In a shock to none, Itan was not elevated to global canon. Spices were banned, however. When asked why he proposed such a thing, Wilhelm reportedly said that he “just wanted to start emulating the cuisine of his mother’s motherland.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>A single vertol made landfall on Bottle Creek’s island, battered, near-crashing. If they could hold on, they could clear a tile for embarked allies to take more ground. If. And even if they did, the Dene forces would still need to break through the one remaining tile, and the way things were going, that one tile may as well have been a thousand miles long. A submarine based missile began firing alongside a complement of rockets from the city itself. Emplaced machine guns began firing. The pilot braced himself for pain.</p><p></p><p>A Swedish scientist made a report on their reverse-engineering of nuclear science. Karl just looked him dead in the eye with disgust. “What does it matter, if we’ll never be able to build one? Why did we waste time on this when we should have made more men!” He slammed the desk. The scientist paused. “Would more men have done anything, as outmatched as we are?” Karl could answer with nothing but sobs.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Lund fell shortly after. While the remaining Swedish soldiers might have been able to retake the city, they never succeeded at doing so. Karl fled the city, escorted by a strange woman, forced to abandon his beloved onesie with a body double to disguise himself. That double did not survive the capture of the city.</p><p></p><p>Wilhelm wrote to his mother, asking if she was finally proud of him after his valiant conquest. “No, you killed a kitten, why would I be?” Wilhelm was heard screaming incoherent fury from across the palace. He would commission a proper eulogy for the fallen lion, in attempt to salvage more glory from the kill.</p><p></p><p>“Thus falls Karl XII, ruler of Swedes; certainly, he stumbled early on, one time he somehow had worse stats than those Gran Columbians who lost their settler to a scout before they had even started recovering. Apparently he just didn’t have terrain or something. Certainly, he never accomplished anything of note, losing ground to us early on despite us being on the opposite side of the bay and then getting rocked by Uzbek peacekeepers. But out of all the leaders in the Cylinder, he was certainly one of them.”</p>"

Long had they protected his people from their Zairian foe; long had they filled space Kurdistan could never have properly filled on their own. But at what cost? Was it worth it to protect his nation at the cost of their dignity as a people? To survive only at the mercy of another? After a long call from Thanadelthur, he came to a conclusion: the Kurds would live and die on their own terms. Rejecting the Uzbek contract, he watched as the Zairian army immediately began advancing over the hills, immediately taking his capital. He loaded his rifle. The fighting had only begun.</p>"

Looking at where other powers sat, the Vandals and Rio Grande weren’t far behind. Their technological superiority over all the midpowers suddenly looked a lot more finite.</p>"

The Uzbeks were a massive thorn in his attempts to destroy Perm, their ‘peacekeepers’ flooding the Cylinder and jamming up conflicts everywhere. He had just had a nice chat with Thanadelthur about that very issue. Now was the time, he decided, to cut off that snake at its head. His superior robotic forces would surely cut through the Uzbek Parajumper hordes like butter. His generals were less certain- sure, pound-for-pound, the Soviet GDRs were far more powerful than what the Uzbeks were fielding, but the Uzbeks had a lot more already on the field. Still, their leader had cast the die.</p>"
