    narration: "<p>Hello everyone! I’m sorry about the episode being late (it was severely delayed due to an appointment), but it’ll be worth it. I’m also your host, CelestialDalek. I have a rather useless Reddit account that I barely use, so I’m really just on the Discord. Clocking in at too many words, I’ve spent a lot of my sanity on doing this. To future narrators: do not put an arbitrary word limit on each of your scenes. Not worth it.</p>"

    narration: "<p>As usual, we have the tile-accurate map by u/Vihreaa, which is, as always, the staple of any CBR fan’s viewing experience as you don’t have to strain your eyes on the minimap to see minimal-effect cities flipping anymore! </p>"

    narration: "<p>Punjab continues to be ranked as the top civ on the cylinder, and it’s showing with all of their cities and army. It’s easy to see why, but the PRs have already gone over this in their writeup, so take a look at it if you haven’t already.</p>"

    narration: "<p>And we’re off with the Chukchi and Chinook continuing their clash, as the Chinook found Cathlamet in the center of the confrontation, certainly crazy. Cadly, I can’t ceep doing chis.</p><p></p><p>The founding of Cathalmet in an active war zone is interesting at best, especially given that Chinook’s navy consists mainly of work boats with the ability to attack. Their poor navy isn’t close to the battle area, but it isn’t all that far either. Note that Cathalmet had been settled earlier but the city name is being reused as the original was razed. We can also see that Japan is in a golden age.</p>"

    narration: "<p>New Netherlands and Rio Grande, in a war that recently started, are fighting a lot in the Caribbean. Needless to say, New Netherland is winning with carracks and galleasses against triremes. Quite a few units are marching from Rotterdam to Monclova, and due to the former Rio Grande city of Saltillo being owned by Mississippi, Rio Grande has to go around the sea just to get to Monclova. Obviously, with the New Netherland navy being more advanced, this is problematic. Ciudad Meier is also taking quite a bit of damage. It’s not a big city, but losing it would still be a huge moral loss.</p>"

    narration: "<p>To confirm, Aghat was indeed taken in the last episode, as a lot of evidence shows. It looks like some Tuareg units tried to retake it but obviously failed. Kidal hasn’t been dented yet, luckily for Tin Hinan, but Burkina Faso has units advanced enough that it should be easy enough to take if they focus. However, this is an AI game, so they aren’t going to focus. Two Sicilies has a terrifyingly large fleet, and due to their UA it can only get better. I can’t find how close they are to the next naval tech, though. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Hong Xiuquan’s heavenly forces advance as Xian burns. The Yuan have sent some units to take it back, but they haven’t sent enough to actually retake it against the Heavenly Kingdom’s army. As such, Xian is going to be yet another burnt patch on the map soon enough. Up north, PARG’s forces are cracking at Northern Yuan, with some troops going from their city of Kansk to Erdene Zuu. It doesn’t really look like Mandukhai is entirely prepared for this push, as the front line around it consists of her trebuchets.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>A Malaccan fleet is roaring towards Hejaz’s seaside colonies. There are already quite a few ships fighting around them. Of course, Malacca is infinitely more prepared than Hejaz, having much better ships and units. Hussein bin Ali has ordered the navy to move out to where the ships are coming from, but the triremes are just getting hit over and over by Jongs. Malacca has enough of a navy to sustain this attack for a long time, but will Hejaz be able to somehow stop it?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Manchu is undeniably on death’s door. A horseman looks to be able to take Hetu Alu, and if that fails the Carrack sitting nearby will be the backup plan. There’s no conceivable way that this can fail, given how airtight the plan of “moving a melee unit three tiles” is generally. I’ll be very annoyed if the Manchu comes out of this alive. The advance of Hong Xiuquan through Yuan is worrying. Xian hasn’t burned yet, but it hasn’t been retaken. The Changmaos are advancing, and with their combat boost on pillaged tiles they can be even better than before.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The area around Tahiti’s capital, in what would be their core, is pretty much barren. Their magical teleporting settlers aren’t exactly doing them much good. Instead, it’s a dump for far-flung penal colonies and exploring triremes. Needless to say, Purea’s two cities over here are not exactly well-fortified. Some Kulin forces, going through the burning city of Sanjo, are heading up towards the Japanese core cities. I don’t think that what they want will amount to much of anything, though, as Japan is a long ways away and they could just go for peace.</p>"

    scene_title: "Ruins? More like a future travel destination!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode9-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>The New Zealand colonies of Tahiti have been fully razed, as could be seen on last episode’s minimap. The Kulin look about to resettle one of the cities, but with the elimination of Purea’s most far-flung colonies her sphere of influence has decreased. This seems to be a hub for forces that obviously are trying to go to Japan, as there’s a flotilla of units that seemingly aren’t doing anything. They do look to be northbound based on the general direction of nearby units, and I’m pretty sure that Japan is the only important war that far north.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Kolchak continues his spree up north against Northern Yuan by attacking Bayanbulag and pushing units through. It looks like PARG can actually do something here, especially with the fact that units can just pop out of the woodwork with Kolchak’s production value. It’s slow and grinding, but it’s starting to work out better and better. Ikh Kuree could fall after that, but the gains are going to be delayed due to the fact that Kolchak is having trouble with trying to do war correctly.</p><p></p><p>As we can see, a very important war declaration happens as Zaire declares war on Kurdistan, which I’m sure is totally going to go somewhere. Perhaps Zaire is revolting at the lack of Kurdistan slides and has decided to take a brute force approach over it.</p><p></p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>Punjab’s forces seem to be doing rather well. The Bhutanese forces have mobilized to try and defend, but the Himalayan campaign has failed. While Kapurthala was in the yellow last episode, it bounced back with the technologically superior forces being brought in by Ranjit Singh. Punjab definitely has a good chance at Thimpu given their nigh-infinite reinforcements available, but with the AI anything is impossible. Thimpu is definitely an easy city to take given the comparative size of both armies. It looks like Laos has a decent-sized army in the mountains despite throwing so many units against Vietnam.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rather surprisingly, the Three Affiliated Tribes are doing something! It looks like they, in their war against the Chinook, have damaged Nemah. Somehow. I don’t think anyone else could have damaged it based on their war list. They probably won’t take it, but they tried. Meanwhile, in the clash of North American civs who have not lost wars miserably, Mississippi is doing a significant amount of damage to K’agee. Sadly, we can’t see how the Chinook are doing on the other side of their empire, but rest assured they’re still losing.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Malacca’s navy has made landfall on the Arabian peninsula with the capture of Al Jumum. Hussein bin Ali’s navy has been smashed into dust by the Jongs flying at them. Their budget has been spent on a subpar military, leaving nothing for naval advancements. It doesn’t even look like Al Jumum flipped to a lot of units, but even more are on the way including even more land units. Luckily for Hejaz, Al Jumum is going to be taken back for sure, but that’s not much reassurance.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Practically, Windhoek has already fallen. We talk about horrible peace deals happening, but really those are just bad outcomes from a sea of good ones. They happen more than they’d like, but a peace deal could happen here and save them - it just has a very high probability of not happening. Zaire has a very advanced army to crush the rest of Namibia with, the question is whether or not they will push on from Windhoek to Butha-Buthe and Bethanie. They could take Bethanie if they had some melee naval units, but as such they only really have a fleet of galleasses to bombard it and are still unlikely to go down to go at it.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Manchu have sadly survived, as the Yuan horseman looks to have either gone back near the capital or died. The Sao continues to be shooting at Hetu Alu, but is on the verge of sinking. A carrack sitting behind the Sao has the opportunity to take it, however, as part of the backup plan previously. If the backup plan fails, Manchu survives. Undeserved.</p><p></p><p>On the sidebar, we see Gran Colombia declare war against Peru-Bolivia, although the mountain passes around Lima will make eliminating Peru-Bolivia more difficult. Gran Colombia definitely has potential here.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Vandals seem to be moving a large amount of ships to back up their original fleet pounding at the Palmares capital. It’s clear that the Palmares have nothing to gain from this war, given how the Vandals are crushing their navy, so the large carpet won’t be useful in this war except for flipping. In fact, the Vandal’s gains are going to be mainly possible from either peace deals or exhausting a ton of time and troops to destroy the carpet via flips. The latter is very unlikely to work, however. They could go for the land route if they manage to hold on to Macaco after taking it, as a pikeman makes a successful landing on South America. It’s going to die, but it tried to do something.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Uzbekistan continues to funnel their knights through that tiny gap to deal quite a bit of damage to Sukhumi. It’s going to be tough to keep it if they take it, though - the Georgian navy in the Caspian Sea is good enough to flip a lot. Luckily for the chances of Uzbekistan, they have a lot of units to push through the gap. </p><p></p><p>Perm seems to have their unique unit - Geoguessr!

    narration: "<p>It was a foregone conclusion, but Windhoek falls. The proximity of Namibia’s army as well as their tech level proves that there’s absolutely no chance at getting it back. It looks like the army will indeed try to move on to Butha-Buthe. Lesotho’s core is looking very nice as well, with plenty of units to back up any expansion that they may decide to undergo. However, their opportunities are limited, as they’re kind of boxed in by Zaire. They also seem to be citadelling Namibia some good amount.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Simon Bolivar has decided to circumvent shovelling units through the Andes by shovelling naval units through the one tile port at Lima. That said, this isn’t a bad decision with all of the naval ranged units that Gran Colombia is fielding in the vicinity. Given how Peru-Bolivia is extremely weak, they have a good shot at taking the city with just the units that they have there already. I don’t think that Santa Cruz can really save himself bar an extremely unlikely peace deal. Note that Marajoara has some musketmen barely visible. </p>"

Deciding that it’s a worthless city as it doesn’t further his goals at fighting Northern Yuan, he burns it. Note that Xian is now ripped from the map, and the Taiping forces continue to advance straight into Yuan territory. Some of their forces look like they were vying for Samdrump Jongkhar, but that has failed. There’s also a settler going for the spot where Xian once was… yeah, I don’t think that’s a very good idea.</p>"

The Trireme block has managed to beat back some of the Jongs by sheer numbers, but not all of them. With two of them right next to Al Julum, it might flip back to Malacca, but they’re not going to be able to ever hold it with the Hejaz army on the Arabian peninsula.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Kulin core they gained from when they beat the Anangu into the dust is looking good. The borders, sadly, haven’t expanded all that much, so there will still be some empty spots in Australia. This is rather sad for mapmakers everywhere. The VOC has some naval trade ships going towards Hawaii's colony of Hilo. Malacca, despite throwing a lot of navy at the Hejaz fight, continues to have an extremely strong naval presence in Southeast Asia, with multiple frigates.</p>"

Cathlapotle isn’t in danger, as it’s back in the yellow, but Watlala is in the red and about to be burned. A coordinated attack on the north by the Chukchi could definitely take some cities down, however.

    narration: "<p>Well, Watala was captured, but this time it hasn’t been burned! That means that the Chukchi have gotten to the point where a 1-population city isn’t seen as a net negative for them in terms of happiness. The problem is that it could get taken back, and this wave of units the Chukchi have sent has mostly been pushed back. Luckily, more are certainly on their way over from the Bering Strait. It’ll remain to be seen if the Chinook are going to use some land units on the cities that aren’t naval - namely Wasco, Ilwaco, and Yehuh. They certainly have potential to do so, as they aren’t exactly fortified at all.</p>"

Their army could probably take some of their neighbors down at this point, as it’s rather advanced and on par with some of the better civs. Certainly better than Hejaz, who they are below in the power rankings for some reason. However, the highlight is in the top right corner: Sukhumi is in the yellow! I don’t think that the attack will be sustained for that long due to the fact that the borders around there prove a chokepoint, sadly.</p>"

Neither side is doing much damage to either of the other side’s units, due to chokepoints at the Great Lakes and the Green Mountains.

Sweden is still trying to actually do something in the war against the Teutons, but Konisberg has still taken minimal damage. In other words, Sweden is still not all that competent for its past performances it was expected to live up to. The Chinook give themselves one fewer enemy by making peace with New Netherland.

It looks like some Uzbek troops are still alive and doing damage to Sukhumi, although we can’t see the city’s health level from this point. We also confirm that Jerusalem is doing very poorly with the loss of their capital, and who can blame them? Either way, I’m sure that this Kurdistan slide is definitely going to be the most noteworthy thing that happens this episode. </p>"

I’m not so confident in their abilities, especially since their troops are not near Mecca. The Ptolemies now have more advanced troops, but Hejaz doesn’t.

I get that knights have a combat penalty against cities, but this seems a little odd even if it does actually work out in the swordsmen’s favor. Either way, the Dene now have a way forwards if they manage to hold on to it. Bottle Creek, another place that would definitely be useful to hold, is dropping, although fewer troops are attacking it than with Kincaid. Gameti, an entirely useless city, has been taken by the Mississippi and is being razed at 1 population. I don’t think they’re just trying to give the tundra dwellers some warmth.</p>"

There’s absolutely nothing that Peru-Bolivia can do about it: after a flip or two, they’re going to be the first to go. Given that the Manchu were predicted to be first to die bar a miracle, this is extremely surprising. And the Manchu have gotten their miracle. Some land units have also infiltrated the shoddy defenses, but the naval units are going to be dealing all of the damage in this war. I’d like to point out how much Lambare cutting off the soon-to-be Gran Colombian borders annoys me.</p>"

A detachment of Rio Grande forces is also running up towards Cahokia, which could spell big trouble for Tuskalooska. Their Falcon Dancers will help, but they’re still on a rapidly sinking ship that keeps sinking faster and faster after hitting the Rio Grande iceberg.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The train of Chukchi units tearing through the upper Chinook holdings continues. After felling Yehuh, an even larger number of units has decided to go after Ilwaco. Kanyak looks like it’s going to fall soon as well if the Japanese scouts move out of the way. The Chukchi are bearing down on Konapee, and with the amount of ships in the vicinity means that it is likely going to be taken. The ships around Chinook (the city) are dead, of course, as the attack was unsustained.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Oh my. The Gauls, wishing to tighten their reign over the British Isles, have declared war on Spain. On the land, the Gauls have a pretty decent advantage as there aren’t a whole lot of troops on Spanish Ireland, and the Gauls have the technological advantage. I can’t be quite sure that this won’t backfire badly for one reason however: naval advantage. The Gauls still have carracks, but the Spanish have a lot of galleons out near the Gaul’s territory. The path to winning this war for either side is going to be one paved with blood.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We end the episode with a cliffhanger war starting: the Chukchi, still fighting out the Chinook, decide to use the rest of their navy to try and attack Taiping. Neither of them have a large navy in the area, but the former Manchu cities that the Chukchi look to wish to use as a forward base are separated from their core by quite a bit. Luckily, they have open borders with Japan judging by some units in their territory, so they should be good.</p><p></p><p>It’s been a wild ride, but we’re done with Episode 9. Four eliminations, a ton of wars, and stupid decisions later, that’s a wrap. I’ve been your host, and have a good two weeks minus a day until the next episode.</p>"
