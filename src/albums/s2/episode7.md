    narration: "<p>Heya everyone, welcome to episode seven of the Civilization Battle Royale X Mark Two! I hope you’re having a wonderful day wherever you are, it’s currently lovely here. I’m u/SkiesOvercast, formerly known as Lordie, a resident power ranker and occasional modder but most importantly, I’ll be narrating you through the next thirty turns on the cylinder. We were left on quite a cliffhanger, with a few spicy wars breaking out, so expect an exciting, all-thrills, many-frills action ride, replete with obscure references from yours truly. With that said, let’s go.</p>"

    narration: "<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/mviuvc/the_citystates_last_part_spoiler/Whilst it might be true that we’ve a few civs down to one city, how many of them do we expect to fall soon? All of them? None of them? I doubt even a Medic could heal the damage to their chances in the BR though. That’s enough TF2 talk, though. Are there TF2 AI games?</p>"

    narration: "<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/mye4ye/so_thats_what_that_japanese_settler_has_been_up_to/ Ah, the tale of the Japanese settler. Truly the most inspiring story since Sejong sent his round a bay in Mk2. Perhaps today will be the day his long ramble comes to conclusion? The journey is truly Vernian though, so the comparison is very apt.</p>"

Everyone’s been talking about that sexy Russia-Perm border, but there are loads of cool shapes to be found! For instance, Germany looks like a snail with a question mark above its head! </p>"

    narration: "<p>Punjab are #1 again! I’m proud that I backed them to win as of Episode 0. Lots of rising and falling with the Stonk Bot this past episode, I personally made a terrible loss. Feel free to join the discord to get in on the action, especially when it’s far more predictable and reliable than IRL stocks.</p>"

    scene_title: "Aqua Periculosa"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>We begin in the Caribbean. The Marajoara navy has been blunted on Aqualtene, even with their Snake-Canoe Galleasses which are apparently more effective for bombarding than a tall ship. Who knew! Instead, P’küee has dispatched missionaries to convert the city. With Hispaniola settled, it’s mildly surprising that the Lesser Antilles haven’t yet been claimed. In the sidebar, Yuan and Japan make peace. </p>"

    narration: "<p>In the western Caribbean, meanwhile, the New Netherlands have pretty comprehensively trounced the Olmec navy and secured Portmore for their Beaver-emblazoned empire. U Kix Chan isn’t having a great time of it, as Rio Grande have pushed across the border and surrounded Coatzacoalcos, and even sent a settler across the backside of Central America- it looks like it’ll land on the coast of Costa Rica. Gran Colombia have secured the Manangue Canal with two citadels as well, clearly recognizing its importance to all us on the sub.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>What would this game be without exclaves and bordergore? Bhera is settled by Raja Raja right in the ashes of his most recent conquest, and an entire Uzbekistan away from the rest of his empire, and within range of PARG retributive aggression. To the west, another exclave is under attack, with the Uzbeks beating down on Kars, one of Georgia’s many wayward cities.</p>"

    scene_title: "On the Shores of Western Europe"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>In the heavyweight clash of Gaul and German, it looks initially like Wilhelm’s warriors are on top, with Cenabum in the red as troops flood in from all sides. Germany’s North Sea fleet has started to cascade down towards Britain but Vercingetorix has pushed up to Vienna- can they retake it? Much like that Icelandic trireme, we’ll have to watch, wait and witness.</p>"

    scene_title: "Anarchipelago"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>Wow, Indonesia is a mess. Malacca are trying to fix this, however, and paint the islands blue. Wuhu and Tongcheng are both low, and if you’re Jan Coen or Lili’uokalani you’d have to be worried that you’ll be on the chopping block next. As an aside, making a good “hello” joke out of Hilo having the Tjukurpa religion and looking like a wave is surprisingly difficult.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Bows of Multan-and-Paro"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>It doesn’t seem like there’s too much to write home about concerning the Punjab-Bhutan border. The Punjab army is up north, presumably on its way to Bhera, whilst Bhutan have apparently trained every single citizen possible in the ways of archery. For a top 3 civ, this sparse a core might be worrying but given ongoing wars, I for one think it’s applicable. The religious game having such a clean split down the border is also very satisfying.</p>"

    scene_title: "Citadel Painting"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Wilhelm has done a phenomenal job here, pushing back the Kosovan border and consequently driving a fair chunk of Ibrahim Rugova’s army into the sea. Kosovo are slowly recovering from the Adriatic conflict with the Two Sicilies, and this won’t help at all. There’s a lot of settlers about here, but unfortunately Europe is pretty much full up at the minute, so they’re stuck being qualified for something they can’t do: also applicable to the arts and culture sector in our world these days.</p>"

    scene_title: "Dead Zone"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Bermuda Triangle is a space of perfectly aligned peace on the cylinder at the moment, as with no North American civs yet able to cross ocean, its pleasant one-tile pasture grows untainted by human hands. A small Icelandic fleet is hovering around Beversrede, clearly having either made friends with Peter Stuyvesant, or won Open Borders in the peace deal. I’m inclined to believe the latter.</p>"

    scene_title: "Leave Your Coatza’ By The Door"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>This looks reasonably dire for the Olmecs at first glance, but given the relatively-little progress Rio Grande have made on their capital, it could be much worse. U Kix Chan’s minimal navy is really hurting the cause right now though, as the free funneling of reinforcements for their northern neighbours through the Gulf means that they can’t easily push back with the time their walls will buy. Also, yay! My settler prediction was correct!</p>"
  - scene_number: 15
    scene_title: "The Blow-for-Blow Countries"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>More like, Cenaburn, I guess. Wilhelm razes his conquest to the ground as the Gauls surround Vienna in a veritable Benelux Bloodbath. With Lutetia well defended, it looks like Vercingetorix could feasibly swing some troops right into the German core if he retakes Vienna. It’s still hard to say who this war favors just yet though, as the German resource bank off-camera to the east is reasonably extensive. The fact they’re losing the naval war isn’t convincing though.</p>"
  - scene_number: 16
    scene_title: "Dogger Bank Drudgefest"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>I’m pretty sure it’s the Dogger Bank, anyway. I’ve never listened to the Shipping Forecast but my mother has a map of the areas on her kitchen wall. Don’t ask. Anyway, it looks like a bit of a rough-and-tumble scrap as nobody has anything better than triremes, making this basically a slapfight. It’s not great for our current Top Europeans though.Also, off-camera: Uzbekistan captured Kars and immediately made peace with Georgia, as did Finland. Who were at war with Georgia. Wild.</p>"
  - scene_number: 17
    scene_title: "The Thin, Light Red Line"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Losing these three cities has really hurt Bhutan, as they’ve made like a .zip and been compressed into a very narrow empire with strong civs on all sides. This has also really depleted their northern carpet, and whilst they can probably reinforce from the many comp bows we’ve seen in their core, you feel that any of their neighbours could take what they pleased right now.In the sidebar, a capital flips and I can reveal it’s Jerusalem being recaptured at present, whilst Awolowo builds a cute military wonder in the Alhambra.</p>"

    scene_title: "Wii Sports Resort"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Mansur Shah continues his Indonesian Invasion with the capture of Wuhu and its two-tile island, as units from all over the cylinder are lost in the archipelago. Anangu warriors, Japanese catapults, Zanzibar triremes and one that might even belong to Peru-Bolivia are all floating around, minding their own business as the Malaccans continue to dominate the region.</p>"

    scene_title: "“In truth, fair Montego, I am too fond”"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>Manangue smolders, but it looks like Gran Colombia can defend the city for now. With his Panamanian outpost secured then, Simon Bolivar turns his baleful eye on that most insulting of Jamaican cities: Montego Bay. Purple troops begin flooding in from Bogota and across Lake Maracaibo. I’m not sure if Jamaica will be able to outlast the assault, but they have prepared a settler to maybe escape if things get desperate.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>Down at the Cape of Good Hope, we’re greeted by a swathe of Alani Horsemen, just lurking off the coast. Meanwhile Namibia, the unanimous Most Boring Civ of the last episode, are still just existing. Lesotho, on the other hand, has reinforced its core and build a pretty hefty navy. I don’t think this is quite the way we thought Southern Africa would go, but I’m definitely enjoying it.</p>"

    scene_title: "Pancake City"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Jerusalem has continued to flip for a while now, with the Ptolemies’ naval advantage allowing them to keep the city zeroed but their lack of land troops preventing them from holding it. Things may change now, however, as Tripoli has fallen, massively reducing Jerusalem’s ability to reinforce their capital- especially with the Kurdish border limiting their supply line from Acre. With the capture Cleopatra has also nabbed some more Legions, always a fun little bonus.</p>"
  - scene_number: 22
    scene_title: "Rehobothersome"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Zaire has surrounded Rehoboth as it appears that Jacob Morenga’s battered empire will be reduced even further. Mobutu just has so much more firepower to bring to bear, and it certainly appears like sub-Saharan Africa will end up being fought out between him and Moshoeshoe I. I can see Rehoboth flipping a few times, but it’s just not really a great time for the Namibians, at all.</p>"
  - scene_number: 23
    scene_title: "Gobi Gore"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene23.jpg
    narration: "<p>Uzbekistan and All-Russia have made peace, hopefully reducing the overall chaos of Central Asia and the Steppes. The Bhutanese partition is yet to be resolved and tidied up, and the same with Bhera, but those are problems for another day. The White Line of PARG settles still looks vulnerable though, even as another is founded in Tyumen’. Perhaps a Yuan will take it up?</p>"
  - scene_number: 24
    scene_title: "Grinding Wheels"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>Sparks continue to fly as two of the cylinder’s greatest war machines clash, but it appears that it’s Germany who’s been worn down more. Poland is almost completely empty, as Vienna is surrounded and deep in the red. With Cenabum almost razed, if Vienna does flip then Western Europe will look very, radically different in the blink of an eye.</p>"
  - scene_number: 25
    scene_title: "Gameti Theory"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>Up in Nunavut, we see that the Neutral-Icelandic war has petered out, with just one archer continuing the fight. The Dene have settled Gameti right in the middle of the Icelandic line of conquered cities, and with the way Kristjan has been playing, I’d not be surprised to see him add it to his collection. Regardless, he’s sent a settler over to continue their colonization of Vinland.In terms of the sidebar, a few people dogpiled on Jerusalem, and Uzbekistan also made peace with Yuan, but the Welsh hate train is slowing.</p>"

    scene_title: "I Wanna Have Waikiki"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>In the latest instalment of the Polynesian Pokefest, once more Tahiti tries to claim Waikiki. As has been mentioned, Lili is basically refusing to build naval units which is unhelpful for an island civ. Fortunately for her, Tahiti are basically entirely toothless right now, and her melee army are probably enough to defend for the time being. I’m sure Purea will eventually claim Hawaii, if she doesn’t die first.</p>"
  - scene_number: 27
    scene_title: "OMG, It’s My Bay!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>In perhaps the pinnacle of the Gran Colombia redemption arc, they take Montego Bay and fully secure the lands that were promised them. It’s not been an easy road, dropping to dead last in the power rankings, but Simon Bolivar has done it. Even if the city flips a few times, we can still say that we were here when our bad guy turned sad guy became a glad guy.As you can probably also see, the Marajoara captured Aqualtene! Perhaps they’ll build the Caribbean to rival the New Netherlands.</p>"
  - scene_number: 28
    scene_title: "Ascalone in the Desert"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>Jerusalem has capitulated, and Baldwin has given over Ascalon in the deal. I’m not sure whether Cleo will be happy about this, frankly. It’s surrounded by Hejaz, who just declared war on Jerusalem to boot, and she has no way to reinforce it. Why are there always Middle Eastern exclaves? But claiming Jerusalem for the Ptolemies is a massive win, no matter how you look at it, especially with Tripoli as well. Pour one out for Hussein bin Ali though, who probably thought he could nab a free city.</p>"
  - scene_number: 29
    scene_title: "Boars and Eagles"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vienna falls (although, spoilers, it’ll flip back immediately), and all of a sudden Germany look a lot weaker. They’ve only got a couple of melee units and though their navy is making inroads to Britain, I doubt the Gallic archers will permit any kind of snipery. Wilhelm will have to play this incredibly well to not lose this ground against his current biggest rival.</p>"

    scene_title: "Tasman Titan"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>Kulin have settled the North Island with my new favorite city name of Nar Nar Goon, and wow that’s fun to say. They’ve also settled Tarneit on Tasmania, and have a navy poking at Tahiti’s cities on the South Island. It’s looking pretty good for William Barak at this point. I still pray for the day we properly get a super-expansive South Pacific civ who can actively challenge Australia.In the sidebar, the Manchu and Laos declare on Vietnam. This could be quite dicey for Uncle Ho.</p>"

    scene_title: "Zaire We Go"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene31.jpg
    narration: "<p>Rehoboth flips over to Zaire, and whilst Namibia can probably aggress onto it, looking at those reinforcements in the Congo I doubt it’ll be blue for long, if at all. The real question now, I guess, is whether Mobutu is satisfied: Gibeon and Kactchanas are probably within reach if he decides to hard commit.</p>"
  - scene_number: 32
    scene_title: "Rhine Time"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene32.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vienna has flipped again, but this time the Gauls look to have it secured. A mass cavalry engagement is going down east of Lutetia, as Wilhelm is throwing everything at the east, abandoning his Swedish territories for the time being. So far it looks like a massive win for Vercingetorix, especially if Vienna comes with those citadels now.</p>"

    scene_title: "Fighting for Scraps"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene33.jpg
    narration: "<p>With Taiping having locked down Ha Noi, Laos are trying to push into Sai Gon, to finally end their annoying neighbours. Being forced through that narrow channel will probably hurt Fa Ngum’s chances though. Meanwhile, Bhutan and Uzbekistan make peace, and as you can see on the minimap, Islam manages to grab Paro, a major city, in the deal. He then proceeds to burn it down. You do you, Karimov.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Mysteries of the Amazon"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene34.jpg
    narration: "<p>Exclaves galore in Amazonia right now, with Paraguay, the Mapuche and Gran Colombia all trying to snap up territory. Peru-Bolivia, meanwhile, are taking snapshots at Maracaibo, seeing if they can steal it away whilst Simon is occupied with Jamaica. Peru-Bolivia are still protected by the Andes at present, which is likely the only reason one of their neighbours hasn’t been able to get in there yet. As it always seems to be with the Andean civ, it’ll just be a matter of time before indirect fire arrives.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Fury of the Northmen"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene35.jpg
    narration: "<p>So, this is an interesting play, to be sure. Germany declares on Iceland, whilst already at war with the Gauls, as we know. Essen is undefended and should be an easy target for Iceland, with a Scandinavian snipe also potentially on the cards. It’s genuinely one of the most bizarre AI decisions I’ve seen. Good luck Wilhelm, I guess!</p>"

    scene_title: "Folklore, Soviets, Saints and Georgia"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene36.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Barents Sea and surrounding territory is another spot of contested borders and confusion. Another Georgian exclave is snugly fitted between the USSR and Perm, having been entirely surrounded by snow settles, such as the ironic Baku on the Murmansk peninsula. This encroachment has also affected Finland, with Mannerheim too now penned in on all sides. That said, he’s a lot more equipped to deal with any Russian aggression, having built up a solid army. Any conflict here should see multiple cities fall, but we don’t want to get too hopeful too soon.</p>"

    scene_title: "Saltillo in the Wounds"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene37.jpg
    narration: "<p>I randomly happen to know a decent amount about Saltillo purely since it was a town an artist I was researching lived and ultimately died in. William Townley Benson, look him up, tragic figure. Nevertheless, it’s still firmly Mississippian at the present time, although those other two Rio Grande cities are surprisingly well set-up and defended. It’ll be interesting when these two heavyweights fight once more.</p>"

    scene_title: "The One Who Wanted Mo’ore’a"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene38.jpg
    narration: "<p>Pain. Agony. Tanaka Kakuei’s hatred will burn in the cavernous deeps of his black heart, within his tiny empire. Why? Since Purea’s settle on the Pitcairns has prevented his own, presumably to have been on Easter Island. The voyage of the Japanese settler has one we’ve watched eagerly, only to have our hopes dashed by Purea as they approached their end goal. Now two triremes gaze sadly across the pink borders to their isolated escort. Shame on you, Tahiti. Shame! </p>"

    narration: "<p>Tongcheng falls down south, as Taiping’s Philippine and Indonesian settles are all but entirely painted over by Malacca. Even now, a fleet swings north to harass Qingpu, and Shouzhou looks undesirably weak, especially with that tech disadvantage.</p>"

    scene_title: "Heads Above The Water"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene40.jpg
    narration: "<p>It’s looking worse and worse. Far from a fightback, the Olmecs have collapsed, and Coatzacoalcos dips into the red with no signs of sanctity anywhere. That lack of a navy is really hurting them. There may be a glimmer of hope, though, in that there’s only two melee units in range. That won’t stop Rio Grande for long, however.</p>"

    scene_title: "Islands of Stability"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene41.jpg
    narration: "<p>Things have started to settle down in the northern Caribbean now, with Montego Bay flipping but itself and Aqualtene both reasonably secure as opposing forces peter out. Jamaica aren’t in a great position right now, although they do have a settler out which could potentially pull them out of the city-state tier. Marajoara having their own island city could be a good chance for them to push out of South America. Overall, this has definitely been the least predictable Caribbean we’ve ever seen.</p>"

    scene_title: "Vercingetorix’ Wall"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene42.jpg
    narration: "<p>Wow, that citadelling of Hafnarfjorthur is unbelievable, what did Kristjan do to the Gauls to deserve that? A settler is being sent north from Condevicnum (coincidentally settled exactly where I’m writing this from IRL), and I think there might be a space to settle where it’s sat right now. Otherwise, the Gallic navy in the North Sea is just about gone, but German poking at Condate is as ineffective as I’d predicted. We see Toypurina declare on U Kix Chan in the sidebar as well, as if things couldn’t get any worse for the Olmecs.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode7-scene43.jpg
    narration: "<p>Being stuck in the middle is never fun, especially if you’re Four Bears. All three of the Affiliated Tribes’ neighbours have settlers who will likely close off the little unoccupied space they might have been able to claim, if they even want to given the Chinook edging ever closer. Bottle Creek from the Mississippi is the latest example of this, as the last open spaces in the world are steadily plugged.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Essen has basically just been a tasty snack for the Icelandic navy for a little while, and they’re definitely hungry as they surround Wilhelm’s Shetland outpost. Given how vulnerable Stettin looks right now as well, this could be a very fortunate turn of events for Kristjan.</p>"

    narration: "<p>That’s another lovely city name for the books as New Netherlands settle the House of Good Hope on Newfoundland. Marcus Garvey, of all people, declares on Iceland now. I guess they’ve racked up some serious diplo penalties, since it seems way out of proportion- they’ve just fought normal battles from my eye test. Reykjavik certainly looks healthy though, no wonder it’s become an esports hub in our world.</p>"

This loss might be entirely inconsequential to Punjab, but it seems like they really wanted to keep it based on that force around Kasur, which was presumably booted out of Uzbekistan when an open-border deal ended. In the sidebar, Hejaz and Lesotho make peace. It’s always nice remembering which random civs are at war.</p>"

Nigeria and Two Sicilies in second and third is quite a surprise, however, and are definitely ones to watch for the next while if they’ve got this much to bring to bear.

Tahiti have another settler out which is something, and I guess they’re doing better than Hawaii? Not a high bar really. Add the South Pacific to my list of “Regions I Really Want To See Be Competitive” alongside Britain and Central America. On the topic of the Americas, Lautaro declares on Peru-Bolivia.

Malacca haven’t turned up yet, so maybe Jigme has a chance to grab some cities before Mansur “Destroyer of Worlds” Shah gets in on the action. On the other hand, the Chola have a decent land army and are starting to head towards Phuntsholing. Bhutan might actually be in a little trouble if they don’t make gains fast.</p>"

Girin has been starved out and is at half health, but Mukden is undamaged, and if Nurhaci can only lose Aigun right now it’d be a huge result. The only flaw with this plan is the fact that Chukchi and Japanese reinforcements alike are streaming down from the north.

Wilhelm’s move of bypassing Shetland with that settler is certainly a unique one, however, and I’m not sure what he hopes to achieve.

Honestly, I’ve no idea who’s winning this war, I think it’s Germany but it’s just a mess of triremes and embarked units.

They’ve held off the Shouzhou recapture fleet and flipped Coolaroo back once since we last saw them, and the only question I have left is when they’ll kill the VOC.
