  scene_title: "Commissarajoara"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We begin this episode with a look at the lands of P’kuee, the buck-naked self-proclaimed “Conqueror” of South America. The Marajoara have been a nomadic horde for a while now, but apparently that decentralized lifestyle hasn’t helped them much - the Kulin and the Vandals have set up colonies right in South America, and Rio Grande is effortlessly fighting them off in Central America. To solve this issue, P’kuee has forcefully taken over the entire government and transformed herself from a mere warlord to a Communist dictator! To commemorate this, she’s also built the Kremlin, granting 50% extra Production for Armor units like Tanks.</p>"

  scene_title: "Grande Armada"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here’s that war front, by the way. While Marajoara is fielding Cruisers and Ironclads against Rio Grande’s Frigates and Privateers, their navy is also heavily outnumbered (or at least completely out of position). Not only that, but the Vandals are also using their ships to hinder Marajoara’s assault on Onguiaahra and Niagara. Marajoara had better get some reinforcements in, or the fleet of Rosillo the Terrible could potentially take Michillimakinac!</p>"

  scene_title: "Pacific Chill"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Just to the west of a Rio Grande-Marajoara naval clash, the cold waters of the Pacific heat up just a bit as King Lawtiliwadlin denounces the Vandals. While this might not seem relevant, the Vandals do have a series of mostly-undefended Pacific colonies ripe for the taking. The Chukchi, on the other hand, have a massive carpet of ships right nearby. If that denunciation becomes a war, the Chukchi could pick up a ton of free (albeit small) cities.</p>"

  scene_title: "It’s All Jong Gone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>A Jong on the verge of death bombards the Lesothan city of Mohale’s Hoek. Once, these prized ships were everywhere in the Malaccan Merchant Horde’s fleet, but now their time has come to an end. There are only three of them in this screenshot, and none are doing very well. Granted, this is partially because Lesotho is putting up a ridiculously strong defense - both Maseru and Mohale’s Hoek are holding out against the cylinder’s premier naval power, and the Lesothan military is poised to retake Hlotse up north, too! I’m sure that Finnish Settler off the coast is quite impressed.</p>"

  scene_title: "Deutschland Uber All-Ice"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Up in the arctic, it seems that Germany has been building up quite the respectable secondary base in Greenland. The navy stationed there, while slightly outdated, is quite large and imposing. Scattered between the German cities, however, are settlements of the nomadic Vandal Kingdom, each defended by a small number of advanced units and a few Soviet peacekeepers for good measure. Even with the defenses, these cities seem like they’d be free food for the Germans if they went to war due to the lack of reinforcements… but considering the Vandals have an easy shot at the German core, war seems like a bad idea anyways.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>With Marajoara requiring the full attention of the Rio Grande Republican army, Rosillo the Terrible elects to make peace with Germany. The people of Hannover celebrate in the streets for what they see as a miraculous victory against an overwhelming opponent. Those rootin’-tootin’ hooligans never stood a chance!</p>"

  scene_title: "Snow Man’s Land"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>After essentially being gifted a massive chunk of North America, the Chukchi have done… basically nothing with their new lands. With all their most dangerous enemies being across the ocean, Lawtiliwadlin has focused his production into naval units, leaving his newly-conquered lands empty. High Priestess Thanadelthur the Just could easily attempt to reconquer the lands she’s just handed away, but to her, a deal is a deal - and besides, a war of reconquest would be long, bloody, and weaken her enough that Rio Grande or Germany could easily invade. For now, Thanadelthur bides her time.</p>"

  scene_title: "Frigatekeeping"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Against all odds, the Malaccan invasion of Lesotho continues to stall as Lesotho not only holds the line but recaptures Hlotse as well! Malacca’s navy only has a few weak melee ships remaining on the front lines, with the bulk of the invasion forces now being made up of ranged Frigates. Maybe Malacca shouldn’t have given up on their Jongs quite yet after all. Not far from the conflict, the Finnish Settler makes landfall on the Horn of Africa to congratulate the Lesothan military on their defense.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Malacca, the Floating Continent"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Lesothan front is fairly sparse, the Malaccan core paints a very different picture of the Merchant Horde. Here, Malacca’s naval carpet is as thick as ever, and while the ships around Lesotho are mostly Frigates, back home Malacca is covered with mighty Ironclads and their iconic Jongs. But why would Malacca keep so many ships at home instead of sending them all to crush Lesotho? Simple - look to the top right. The Chukchi have a similarly massive carpet, and while a poor invasion of Lesotho is humiliating, it’s way better than using up their military and being under-equipped to fight off a potential Chukchi invasion.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Right Hoek, Left Jab"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Even with most of their forces situated elsewhere, though, Malacca isn’t about to give up on their invasion of Lesotho. They’ve abandoned the siege of Maseru in favor of focusing on Mohale’s Hoek and to a lesser extent Hlotse. But Hlotse in particular might be a tough one to capture - it seems that Nigeria of all civs has come to defend the city from Malacca’s invasion! Have the two former rivals of Nigeria and Lesotho made an unlikely alliance to keep foreign influence off the continent?</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Simon Says…"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the lands of the Soviet People’s Republic, which is very appropriately a Communist state. Lenin’s empire is now fielding its UU, the Levy, which is a weaker but cheaper Great War Infantry replacement that can use enemy roads. Seems like it could be handy against the All-Russians, at least, with their underdeveloped military and abundance of roads.</p><p></p><p>Even more interesting, though, is the new Great General that Dictator Vladimir Lenin has hired. He’s a mysterious man, claiming to be a deposed former ruler who’s clawed his way back from hell itself to enact revenge on those who wronged him. He’s enlisted in the Soviet military and offered Lenin his talents, under one condition: Lenin must make Marajoara burn. Lenin has agreed to these terms… but of course, he’ll need this strange general’s help to get an Atlantic port, first.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "…Germany Must Go!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>With the power of Simon Bolivar at his side, Lenin finally decides to declare war on Germany, hoping to wipe them off the map once and for all! Unfortunately, though, it doesn’t seem like Lenin has thought this war through. Germany’s long chain of Citadels has let them place a whole load of soldiers right outside Nizhniy Novgorod and Petrograd, while the Soviet military seems to consist mostly of Workers. The Soviet navy is more advanced, but it’s also more spread out, so they’ll have a tough time taking control of the North Sea. Lenin’s only saving grace is the fact that Germany’s cavalry units all have a combat penalty against cities, but even then, this war could easily end up backfiring for the Soviets.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Iberiarrrrr"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Around the isolated German city of Bremen, Soviet Privateers do battle with the German fleet stationed around the city, also mostly made up of Privateers. This battle will surely go down in history as Gallic, Vandal, and even Kulin troops gather to watch the Iberian Pirate Wars unfold.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Negative Charge"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Unfortunately for Germany, it seems like their blitzkrieg-style full cavalry charge into Soviet lands may be about to bite them in the ass, because the Vandals have also declared war! Germany only has a couple of coastal cities in Europe for the Vandal navy to attack, but with their entire army currently along the eastern front, the Vandal land forces might be able to capture a couple of cities anyways.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Horse Beats Bear"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Even with the news of a Vandal invasion from the southern, King Wilhelm II decides that he’s already in too deep to divert forces from the Soviet front - he’d rather crush one foe than spread out his forces and lose to two enemies at once. The German navy will have to hold its own. In the meantime, the German cavalry forces have completely surrounded Petrograd, and they’re putting pressure on Nizhniy Novgorod and even Tsaritsyn. There’s even a Cavalry unit on the gates of Moscow! The Soviet military is small and disorganized, so now it’s a matter of how far the Germans can push before their cavalry runs out of steam and/or the Soviets organize a counter-assault.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Hoek, Line, and Sink ‘er"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca’s invasion of Lesotho is finally seeing a bit more success with the capture of Mohale’s Hoek. Maseru has been taken as well, but the Lesothan military has already surrounded the city and is moments away from retaking it. Lesotho’s forces are seemingly endless, while Malacca is running low on ships in the area - Mansur Shah had better regroup his forces, or he’ll lose Mohale’s Hoek once again.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pictured: Wilhelm Gets Enough Generals to Barely Make Up for His Own Incompetence"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Vladimir Lenin is absolutely stunned at how, despite having a second ruler on his side, he’s still managing to lose a war to the famously incompetent Germans. Well, it turns out that Simon Bolivar wasn’t the only former CBR competitor to escape the sub. The mighty Trung Vuong - a.k.a. Trung Trac of Mk. 2 Vietnam fame - is now working under the command of Wilhelm II. In fact, at the suggestion of yet another former CBR competitor apparently from the same lands as the Vandals, Wilhelm has decided to hire nine separate Great Generals at once! That’s nice and all, but he’d better not forget to build units for those generals to lead.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "General Overkill"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The German cavalry continues to surround every city on the German-Soviet border at once, perhaps due to the combined strategic genius of nine generals at once. Lenin isn’t lacking in Great Generals either, though - I count seven in this screenshot alone, including fellow Communist dictator Fidel Castro in the far east. Neither side’s generals have made it to the front lines just yet, but once they do, expect combat bonuses and Citadels galore.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "(Great Musician)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca’s wave of success in Lesotho has turned out to be brief, and they’re once again about to be pushed off of the African mainland with Mohale’s Hoek in the black. To raise morale, the Malaccan aristocrats have hired a musician by the name of Louis Armstrong, who is VERY insistent on being called a Great Musician. It’s a little off-putting, but the Malaccan soldiers have to admit, he’s damn good at what he does.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Vandalizing Hannover"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The German outpost of Hannover is unable to repeat their miraculous victory against Rio Grande, as the Vandili navy easily crushes the city’s defenses with their superior navy. Bremen is similarly unable to resist conquest, as the German pirates are overwhelmed by the might of Vandili Ironclads. The German Arctic fleet is making its way to recapture these cities, but for now, the Vandals have established full control over the Atlantic Ocean.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "The Vandals Have No Chill"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The German navy is no slouch either, mind you - they’ve easily conquered the Vandal colonies of Vienna and Lutetia, though the isolated city of Hadrumetum is proving tough to reach. In the North Sea, the Germans are seeing similar success, outnumbering and crushing the Soviet ships around Norway. The Privateers which make up the bulk of the German fleet are weak, but they do have a chance to capture the Vandal ships they defeat, so their fights against further Vandal and Soviet fleets will definitely be worth keeping an eye on.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "You Put the Whole Fleet In, You Kick the Whole Fleet Out, You Do the Hoeky Pokey and you Flip Yourself About"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca has lost Mohale’s Hoek to Lesotho, but the Malaccan fleet has regrouped and is ready to retake the city once again. However, Nigeria has a naval blockade set up to keep Malacca away from the city, and with all the advanced Lesothan melee and artillery units nearby, it’ll probably flip right back even if they do manage to take it. With all this intense fighting taking place, even the Finnish Settler can’t help but watch the action unfold up close. That seems a bit dangerous! Hopefully they won’t get caught in the crossfire.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Big Guns, Small Pass"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Rio Grande-Marajoara War is still at a stalemate. Rosillo the Terrible has secured the land border with Marajoara using a large squadron of Uhlans, but Rio Grande’s fleet has been devastated, leaving the Gulf of Mexico fairly empty. That being said, Marajoara may be able to turn the tides now - they’ve developed Infantry and Machine Guns, dwarfing the power of the Rio Grande military… but that’s not worth anything unless P’kuee can manage to push through Central America or land her troops on some other shore of Rio Grande. She’ll need a few more boats if she wants to make that happen.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Atlantic Armageddon"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The German and Vandal fleets have finally met, and they’re doing battle all across the Atlantic Ocean. The two sides seem about evenly matched, but the Vandal lines have broken down on the left side, allowing the German ships to launch a bit of a flanking maneuver. Also notable is that Gergovia has fallen to the German navy, granting Germany access to the Atlantic Ocean from a mainland European city. There’s a small Vandal-Soviet attack on the city going down right now, but it won’t be enough to hold the city at this rate. Overall, not a bad look for the newly-empowered Nationals of the German government.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "The Problem with Blitzkriegs"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Germany has Petrograd surrounded and in the red, and Tsaritsyn is also under pressure… but things aren’t going as perfectly for Germany as it might seem. Germany isn’t producing any new land units (clearly a case of corruption, as the heads of the Nationals in Germany are also the top admirals), so once the cavalry forces in the east run out, the German assault is done. Not only that, but the Soviets are finally mobilizing a force around Tsaritsyn, and the Vandals are beginning to attack Cologne. The Germans had better beat the Soviets quickly, or their invasion could quickly turn itself on its head - and the Vandals are masters of exploiting exhausted invasion forces.</p>"

  scene_title: "Medi-terror-anean"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of the Vandals, here’s a look at their invasion force - their ships blanket the Mediterranean, and the Germans have no defenses but the mountains along their southern border. A few brave ships are keeping the Vandals out of the Aegean Sea to protect the city of Cologne, but the Vandals are getting around this by launching a land invasion of the city from the west instead! The Vandals haven’t bothered attacking the German core just yet, but once Cologne falls, they’ll have a straight shot towards Berlin.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Shades of Stalin"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Germany has captured Petrograd from the Soviets! Unfortunately for them, though, the German invasion force has seriously dwindled as a result of the long siege. On the other hand, the Soviet forces have finally mobilized, and they match the remaining German forces in power at the very least. The Soviet navy has also gained total control over the Baltic Sea and could now threaten Breslau in Denmark. The players in this German-Soviet War may be from World War I, but the situation unfolding here seems suspiciously close to that of World War II’s Eastern Front… and if the war doesn’t end soon, the Soviets might end up on the gates of Berlin this time, too.</p>"

  scene_title: "At Least It’s Extra Production"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>As the Soviet war front begins to stall, Wilhelm and the German Nationals desperately look for a way to keep morale high before the weight of invasion crushes them. Their solution? Another war. Sure, they don’t exactly have troops to spare, but the Dene are weak and the Arctic Fleet is as strong as ever! They even rope Marajoara in, since they’re looking for a way to get a foothold in North America. There’s no way this war could backfire for the Germans, right?</p>"

  scene_title: "The Progressive Agenda"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>As German cavalrymen desperately hold Petrograd, the Vandals bring the city of Cologne into the yellow. Power in King Genseric’s court has just shifted to the Progressives, and they’re eager to prove their worth - with Great War Infantry in Gergovia and Cologne all but surrounded, the new Vandal government may end up with quite a nice string of early victories to show for itself. That is, if the German army currently marching down into the Balkans doesn’t put a stop to the invasion.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Germans have now managed to clear the Vandili cavalrymen out of Cologne’s borders, and they’ve reinforced the border along the Alps as well, but that’s come at the cost of Petrograd’s defenses utterly collapsing. The bulk of the Soviet forces are a couple of tiles away from the city right now, but they’re coming for Petrograd, and they’re coming from all sides. Oh, and the Soviets have planes now, too. This could be the beginning of the end for Germany right here, folks.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hey Look! It’s Real-Life Greenland!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Even Germany’s arctic holdings are looking barren now. All the ships have left to fight the Vandals in the Atlantic or the Dene in North America, and from the looks of it, the Dene are holding them off fairly well. Even the undefended city of Hadrumetum is untouched as the few German troops left in Greenland can’t seem to break past the mountains in the area. Granted, it’s located in a defensible position, but it’s still not a good look. Germany is running out of units, and even the extra Production they get from being at war doesn’t seem to be helping them.</p>"

  scene_title: "Up Shit’s Krieg"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Petrograd has fallen back to the Soviets, and it doesn’t look like it’ll flip back anytime soon. The Soviet military is still a few tiles from Munich, but the path to the city is completely devoid of any defenses, save for a river on one side and some hills on another. What’s worse, if Munich falls, the Soviet Levies can easily follow the German roads right over to Berlin and Breslau (in Denmark). Even Prizreni in the Caucasus is taking damage from a Soviet assault. Germany is faring better against the Vandals right now, but even on that front troops are running thin - Cologne, Pristina, and even Frankfurt might be in trouble soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a truly humiliating turn of events, the Malaccan assault on Lesotho’s coast has been repelled so thoroughly that Lesotho has been able to launch a counter-attack by sailing a few Infantry units over to Madagascar! They probably won’t take any cities, but the fact that Lesotho can manage such a thing at all is absolutely ridiculous. I have no clue where all the Lesothan Republic is getting all these units, by the way. Perhaps they’ve become so battle-hardened from all the years of war that every single citizen is able to act as a reserve soldier?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode30-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Dene-Germany war is proving to be surprisingly even. Up north, the Dene navy has successfully broken up the German fleet, and seems to be repelling them quite well. Further south, however, a second fleet of German ships has surrounded Ounonisaton, though the ships appear too damaged to beat all the defending units and properly capture the city. The two sides appear evenly-matched technologically, too. All this just goes to show that the Dene aren’t quite irrelevant just yet. That, or the Germans really are in a terrible spot right now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A Soviet Cavalry squadron rides toward the gates of Munich. It is alone for now, but there are more of its kind not far from the city, and they’re backed up by Soviet Levies and Field Guns. King Wilhelm tells the people of the city not to fear, but with only a lone Field Gun to hold the line, the defenseless citizens know better than to listen to their mad king’s words. The Nationals tell them that everything is going according to plan, that the filthy Communists will be stopped at the gates and that the military will fight with everything they have, but if that’s the case, then why are there no soldiers in the city? </p><p></p><p>Riots break out. Panic sets in. The Cavalry take note, and word makes its way back to the mighty Soviet dictator back in Moscow. He smiles. Everything is going according to plan.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As war rages in the eastern German holdings of Andijan and Prizreni, soldiers of the All-Russian Empire watch on. This brutal fascist dictatorship is technologically underdeveloped and surrounded by stronger powers, not to mention fairly under-carpeted for a civ at peace. But they’re not irrelevant just yet. If they were to time an attack right, they could easily take a city from the Soviets or Punjab, especially if they start researching useful military technologies instead of beelining naval techs. And if they don’t… well, at least they’d still be doing better than Andijan is right now. One heavily-damaged Cavalry isn’t exactly a good city defense.</p>"

Hell, they’ve already recaptured Gergovia in the west!

A Marajoara fleet has properly mobilized in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Rio Grande blockade of Panama has been broken, but the real game-changer here is right outside the city of Tampico - a Marajoara Paratrooper. With this, Marajoara can bypass the thin passages of Central America entirely and drop troops right next to Rio Grande cities as they please. By comparison, Rio Grande has their unique Cavalry replacement, the Vaquero, which is stronger when attacking over Rivers. Not very helpful in this scenario.</p>"

Germany has somehow built enough of an army to make a small push on Aleria, while the Vandals have brought Hamburg into the yellow. It’s a surprising amount of action for such a barren war front. What’s more, Germany actually has a new unit to bring to the table: their unique Stormtroopers, a GWI replacement with extra strength against gun units, fortified units, and ranged attacks in open terrain. Definitely quite a versatile unit, but probably not enough to launch a proper counterattack at this point.</p>"

All these ships are doing nothing but sitting along the border menacingly, but if they don’t keep expanding, Malacca and even the Chukchi could end up left in the dust.

Between their blobby and outdated design, their murder of fan favorites such as Burkina Faso and the Ptolemies, and their dominance in late Cycle 1 as a “boring land empire” over fan favorites like Malacca and the Vandals, Nigeria had its fair share of haters. But lest we forget, Nigeria was an underdog at one point that conquered its way across Africa fair and square. With the coming of Cycle 2, Nigeria looked ready to repeat their dominant performance in Africa even with the Vandals crowding them out, destroying Zaire and beating up Lesotho with Malacca’s help… only to have a seemingly one-sided war against the Vandals horrifically backfire, costing them their entire empire and reducing them to just their extremely thicc capital.
