    narration: "<p>At last, the dawn of the final day is upon us! It is in the following scenes that the outcome of this season will be decided, and there’s no consensus as to who will win it all: could it be the Amazon-dwelling Marajoara, or will it be the Chukchi of the icy north? Or, if you’re incredibly naively optimistic, maybe Lesotho? No matter who you foolishly bet on, there’s only one way to find out.</p><p></p><p>The first half of this episode will be brought to you by Admiral Cloudberg, who needs no introduction, and the second half will be brought by LacsiraxAriscal, our game runner for season 3, who also needs no introduction. With that out of the way, let us begin...</p>"

    narration: "<p>Thanks, as ever, to everyone who has donated. Not only have you made this series possible, but you’ve made CBRX3 possible too.</p><p>Coiot: Once again a personal thank you for everyone that chooses to donate, even just $1 at a time, to keep the show going. This season would not be possible without those listed here, and I hope those in the community reading will help us through the gap between seasons to continue the momentum. Any amount really goes a long way, and I know many have used $1 on lesser stuff worth your time every month which would make a big difference here.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Despite the Chukchi making slightly more ground last episode, the Power Rankers felt more confident in the Marajoara’s chances of seeing out the finale, as the Chukchi failed to catch up in production and have a potentially crippling allergy to air units, severely affecting their ability to progress quickly and efficiently through enemy lands. But P’kuee still has to take advantage of Lawtiliwadlin’s weaknesses if he wants to prove the Power Rankers right.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We kick off the episode with an overview of North America, where we can see the irradiated wasteland formerly known as Wisconsin, created by the use of a nuclear missile against the city of Deline. This comes as part of a Chukchi counterattack in North America which has not only wiped a city off the map, but also resulted in the capture of Khioetoa and a brief flip of Dettah since we last saw this area at the end of episode 34.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Farther to the southwest, the battle for Baja continues, with Marajoaran biotitans facing off against Chukchi nexuses across the Gulf of California. Since we last saw this area, the Marajoara have retaken Monterrey, but the situation remains highly fluid.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile behind the front lines, a low-level Chukchi bureaucrat discovers that San Nicolás de los Garza has too many letters to fit into the input field for the official Chukchi Annexation Form. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in Africa, the Vandals exist, although their existence is a wretched one, condemned to be constantly liberated and then killed again by their liberators mere moments later. Farther to the west, front line cities continue to flip back and forth interminably, as Lesotho recaptured Teyateyaneng but lost Lubumbashi sometime in between episodes 34 and 35.</p>"

    scene_title: "Frankfurter free-for-all"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>In Europe, the jump to episode 25 has seen Chukchi take Frankfurt again, as Lawtiliwadlin slogs his way forward against what looked two weeks ago like a potential Marajoara counterattack. Looking at it now, however, the two sides seem about evenly matched, and who gets the upper hand here is anyone’s guess.</p>"

    scene_title: "Hark! Numbers!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>The denizens of the Babylonian sub have granted us a look at the statistics, namely the number of cities. This figure doesn’t seem to have changed much since the end of episode 34, as the Chukchi still have way more cities than the Marajoara. Nevertheless, last time the Marajoara had almost twice as much production and slightly more military manpower, so...</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>...oh. Well, the Chukchi seem to have regained the lead in military strength, although very narrowly. From these stats it would seem like I have to give the edge to the Chukchi, but what about the all-important production?</p>"

    scene_title: "Winter of Discontent"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Never mind, seems we won’t be getting any production stats. Instead we get an overview of the southern part of the Chukchi core, where Advanced Destroyers and Nexuses are plentiful, as are settlers for some reason. It’s not clear where Lawtiliwadlin would go with those settlers, nor does it seem like he should be founding new cities, seeing as his empire is discontent which I assume means he has negative happiness. That could be a liability going forward if he doesn’t get it under control.</p>"

    scene_title: "Just a quick, in-and-out anti-Lesotho operation, how hard can it be?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in Africa, both sides are still struggling to make any headway against Lesotho, despite an overwhelming advantage in firepower. Marajoara now has an abundance of melee units in the form of Biotitans—the monstrous green things—but this has not yet produced the breakthrough we were hoping for at the end of the last episode.</p><p></p><p>The Vandals are alive again though, so there’s that. Another turn, another resurrection, only to die again, Dark Souls style.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In our first look at Scandinavia so far this episode, we can see that the front line hasn’t moved much since the end of episode 34, but the Chukchi are clearly on the offensive, with a massive swarm of Nexuses ravaging the island colony of Dusseldorf. The city will surely fall, but where will the swarm go next? Marajoara’s defenses here seem thin.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Rains Down in Africa Are Made of Metal"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>The front line in Africa has not changed at all since we last saw it, but I will take this opportunity to point out that Marajoara no longer dominates in terms of air forces. P’kuee has 16 planes in this image, while the Chukchi (who formerly had no planes to speak of) now have 10, and Lesotho has 19.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>Lawtiliwadlin’s flanking maneuver has paid off as the Chukchi take full control of the west coast of North America. And with Laredo in the red and a nexus nearby, we might be looking at an imminent collapse of this front, which is bad news for Marajoara.</p>"

    scene_title: "They’re Quming for your Quthing"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Chukchi have begun to make minimal progress on the African front in the two turns since we last saw it, capturing Quthing on Madagascar and putting the Vandals out of their misery yet again. Of course, that probably won’t stop Moshoeshoe from attempting to prolong Genseric’s suffering even more in the future.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Swarm Descends"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Over in Europe, the Chukchi have launched a massive push to overwhelm Marajoaran forces on the continent, capturing Vipuri and threatening Porvoo, Munich, and Cologne. Combined with their setbacks in North America, it looks like P’kuee’s defensive line might be starting to crumble around the world.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>The fall of Laredo, the former Rio Grande capital, is a momentous event. If P’kuee couldn’t defend this metropolis, can she defend anything?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Farther to the southwest, Marajoara’s Polynesian holdings are utterly collapsing as the Chukchi capture numerous cities. With a swarm of Nexuses running roughshod over the sparse Marajoaran defenders, this entire region will surely be painted blue before much longer.</p>"

    scene_title: "Handing It Over"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>Lacsirax here! Taking over for the next set of slides. When Cloudberg said “first half of the slides,” he meant, you know, a little half. I’m gonna be taking things quite quickly, because there’s a loooot of slides to get through, and I know you all just want to see how this show ends. Let’s roll… </p><p></p><p>Little progress on this front since last time we saw it, except that the Vandals are back yet again. At this rate they seem a safe bet for #2, surely? P’kuee’s forces still far outclass Moshoeshoe’s, but they seem almost terrified to approach the Lesotho front.</p>"

    scene_title: "All Quiet on the Wild Western Front"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Marajoara recover somewhat on the American front, retaking the Rio Grandese capital as well as Monclova. This front doesn’t seem to be a priority for either party, with the real war taking place in Eurasia, as both sides of the border are barren of units. You’d suspect the Marajoara production base would kick in here soon, but will it be too little, too late?</p>"

    scene_title: "Spot the Lesothoan Industrial Exclave"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>Vaga falls once again as the Marajoara continue to seem too shy to approach Lesotho, while the Chukchi seem to have left this front altogether. It seems the constant warring has left all sides a little exhausted, and it might be a while before things start picking up again. In CBRX1 the game stalemated after a while - could we be seeing the same thing happen here? Well, we do still appear to have a lot of slides left… </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Chukchi have recaptured Porvoo but appear no closer to taking Munich, despite their clear superiority on the land. The Marajoara already seem to have retreated to a stronger defensive backline at Breslau and Berlin.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Chukchi have momentarily seized control of the Eastern Mediterranean, but their hold seems flimsy, with P’kuee’s ships ready to roll back into Crete. My mum’s on holiday in Crete right now. I hope she’s alright.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>Munich inevitably falls, but it feels like the Marajoara might be starting to turn the tide, at least going off the boots on the ground. Cologne and Frankfurt both look vulnerable too. Still, this is only reclaiming territory they recently lost - we’re a long way yet from a Marajoara reversal of fortunes.</p>"

    scene_title: "She Does This a Lot"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Chukchi are certainly making more progress in America, despite (or because of?) the relative lack of units on both sides here. Laredo and Monclova are retaken, and Saltillo and Quinaoutatoua join them. It does look like the Marajoara have the units to at least flip the cities. The Chukchi have also resettled Wisconsin with the settlement of Ilurney.</p>"

    scene_title: "It’s Significantly More Annoying than Cute"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene31.jpg
    narration: "<p>If there’s any sign more telling of P’kuee’s current misfortunes, it’s that even Lesotho are fighting back now - retaking Mbuji-Mayi, Jos and even a distant Abuja. But the Marajoara have at least reclaimed a hold on the East Med, taking back Port Harcourt and Caput Vada.</p>"

    scene_title: "Especially When She Starts to Dig Her Claws In"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene32.jpg
    narration: "<p>P’kuee strikes back, expectedly flipping Saltillo and Quinaoutatoua while also wiping Ciudad Victoria off the map. It still looks to the naked eye like she has the greater numerical advantage here, but that hasn’t translated into a meaningful fightback yet.</p>"

    scene_title: "Or Gets a Bit Too Toothy"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene33.jpg
    narration: "<p>In fact, in just a turn Saltillo falls back and the Chukchi go one further, seizing Matamoros. They’re almost in South America! That would be an ominous portent. At least P’kuee retains some naval supremacy in the Caribbean.</p>"

    scene_title: "My Friends Say It’s a Sign of Affection"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene34.jpg
    narration: "<p>If there’s one takeaway from this shot, it’s the supremacy of Nexuses. (Nexi?) The Chukchi have maybe half the units of the Marajoara in this region, but most of them are Nexuses, which P’kuee continues to forgo building. And resultedly, another original capital falls - Berlin.</p>"

    scene_title: "I Think She Just Wants Me to Feed Her"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene35.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Chukchi dominance over the Pacific continues, as yet more Nexuses swarm the Galapagos, having swept up every other Polynesian island in their path. The blue tide flows ever closer to the shores of South America.</p>"

    scene_title: "I’m Literally Soaked in Feline Saliva"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene36.jpg
    narration: "<p>P’kuee engineers something of a comeback in Scandinavia, taking back not only Porvoo but Viipuri too. Kotka has been a fairly reliable holdout for much of the recent war, despite seeming difficult to keep supplied. If the Marajoara could get a navy through the Straits of Jutland, they could deal some pretty serious damage to the Chukchi Baltic.</p>"

    scene_title: "It’s Absolutely Vile"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene37.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Chukchi retake Quinaoutatoua and also take Andachkhrob for what it’s worth. On all fronts, it doesn’t seem to matter how much Marajoara look better on the ground, or indeed in the air, they’re bleeding territory.</p>"

    scene_title: "Why Did We Buy You"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene38.jpg
    narration: "<p>If you’re wondering why these Polynesian islands don’t just fall immediately… Well, Nexuses are great for most things, but attacking amphibiously isn’t a strong point. Still, Thenae has fallen and it’s difficult to see Tripolis holding more than a couple more turns.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene39.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Marajoara have been such wonder-whores in this game, they’re only a fraction behind the Chukchi, who by this point have a far superior lead in terms of cities held. Moshoeshoe retains a respectful seven.</p>"

    scene_title: "I Really Wish You’d Find Another Pastime Though"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene40.jpg
    narration: "<p>The European front continues to ebb and flow, with the Marajoara once again conceding Berlin but having more success in the Balkans, taking Cologne and Frankfurt. Notice how damaged the Chukchi cities are compared to the Marajoara ones - that’s gotta be holding Lawtiliwadlin back just a tad.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene41.jpg
    narration: "<p>Moshoeshoe is probably twiddling his thumbs, amazed that his nation has somehow escaped the superpowers’ wrath thus far. Abuja falls back to P’kuee, but it’s clear Lesotho is no one’s priority right now - has that diagonal line of Marajoara units even moved an inch?</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene42.jpg
    narration: "<p>Once again the Marajoara look to be on a fightback, retaking Matamoros, Saltillo and Quinaoutatoua, and on the doorstep of Laredo too. They certainly seem to have the numerical advantage, but thus far it’s not helping them do much better than stalemate.</p>"

    scene_title: "First Contact"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene43.jpg
    narration: "<p>More worrying though is the fall of Tripolis, and with it, the first Nexuses to land on South American soil. This army could either wreck the main Marajoara production base, or perform a pincer attack on Mexico - both situations are pretty disastrous for poor ol’ P’kuee.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode35-scene44.jpg
    narration: "<p>On the other hand, it finally feels like there’s tangible progress in Europe, as Berlin and Port Harcourt are retaken with nothing bled to the Chukchi in the exchange. Lawtiliwadlin is running out of his magic weapon here - there’s only a couple of Nexuses on the front line.</p>"

    narration: "<p>It appears the Polynesian contingent are focusing on the pincer approach I floated earlier, venturing north in the direction of Jimenez, as both Matamoros and Tampico fall without their input. Tapereba on the hand takes only token damage.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Chukchi core is a puzzling sight - their land armies are almost entirely dispersed to the front lines, as they should be. But you can’t help but think they must be able to find a use for the absolutely huge navy that’s still sitting outside their harbours. Throwback to when Kosovo founded a city in northern Siberia. Gjilani still stands proud.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The European front continues to flicker, as the Marajoara gain Berlin but lose Cologne. They’re still fielding what appears to be far numerically superior forces, but they’re just not the right forces - their refusal to join the Nexus party is seriously stymying how much they can achieve.</p>"

    narration: "<p>It doesn’t seem long ago that this area was a bloody warzone - and lest we forget, look at all the citadels still plonked around Kasur. Central Asia may be quiet here, but it’s a very busy time for the region in the Civ V modding world - if you haven’t already, check out the Crossroads of the World event going on at the moment, where many fantastic new mods covering this oft-overlooked region are being released.</p>"

    narration: "<p>As in Europe, the North American front is still very tit-for-tat, as the Chukchi and the Marajoara continue to exchange the same set of front line cities. P’Kuee will need a breakthrough here sooner rather than later - it may not feel like it, but the Chukchi are *very gradually* moving the front lines in their favour.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Less gradual is their assault on the coasts of South America, as Jimenez falls and Tapereba is made the next target. The Marajoara have managed to retake Matamoros, just off the top of the screen, but this is one front the Marajoara can’t really afford to be contesting, especially as the Chukchi core remains untouched.</p>"

Blimey, did any of us see Lesotho making it this far? Never mind at the start of the game, even at the start of Endgame? But it was hardly undeserved. While Lesotho were never the flashiest of competitors; for most of Cycle 1 they stayed out of too much trouble, using Zaire (and Zanzibar I suppose, remember them?) as something of a buffer against the undisputed titans of Africa, Nigeria - before surprisingly benefiting from a coalition war that split Zaire between them and Nigeria right at the end of the cycle. Still, in Cycle 2 most had pegged them as early food for Nigeria. But as the latter failed to impress, Moshoeshoe took the initiative to transform Lesotho into Africa’s leading light. They never truly broke out much further than that, making some incursions into the Middle East but leaving the Vandals for other nations to take apart. Still, they held out for a considerable time in Total War, and they leave the Cylinder with bronze medals and their heads held high!</p>"

The remaining cities fall to Lawtiliwadlin next turn, and the Marajoara are eliminated in second place, with just a few civilians left to their name.</p><p></p><p>The Marajoara had a strange early life. South America was a strange continent in general, as - with the exception of a miserable Peru-Bolivia - no civ seemed to especially excel over the other. Marajoara were always the local tech leaders, but like many science-hounds, seemed somewhat uninterested in warring. Eventually though they managed to subsume all their neighbours, allowing them to exhaust each other with wars and gradually sweeping through the remains, taking over the former lands of Gran Colombia, Palmares and Paraguay before finishing off the Mapuche. Rio Grande’s defence bug stopped them from making any real progress north of the Caribbean, however. This left them in a unique position in Cycle 2, with not especially powerful buffs but with an entire continent to themselves. This proved enough to transform them into a clear frontrunner, able to sweep through the divisive North American nations while also finally able to break through into the former lands of Nigeria and the Vandalic Empire. But this did take them far longer than it should’ve - they had clear superiority for many years prior, and perhaps if they hadn’t waited so long to complete these invasions, they’d have been in better stead to fight Total War. Statistically they had the edge over the Chukchi coming into the war, but they were beaten by a better makeup of units and having significantly more isolated fronts to defend than the blobby core of the Chukchi. Still, there’s little shame in second place. And more to the point, I’d never heard of the Marajoara going into CBRX2 - now I certainly won’t forget them.</p>"

If I hadn’t formally stated it already, here it is: the Chukchi finish in first place.</p><p></p><p>The Chukchi weren’t particularly on people’s radars coming into the game, with their isolated start thought to be fairly useless considering the frigidity of the land, not to mention them sharing a direct border with the Part 0 favourites, Northern Yuan. But as we all know, whoever the PRs rank 1st in Part 0 are doomed to do terribly, while civs in Mongolia are doomed to be disappointing, and so Chukchi took advantage of their relative safety. But not in the way we expected. Like Malacca to the south of them, they commanded an incredible naval empire, making short work of nearby oceanic neighbours like the Chinook and Japan, also dispatching the equally overhyped Manchu. At the end of Cycle 1 they’d established a fine empire stretching across the Bering Strait.</p><p></p><p>They got off to an equally good start in Cycle 2, and after the collapse of Nigeria, became a frequent fixture at the top of the Power Rankings. They played very similarly, commanding a naval hegemony that even managed to overpower Malacca, focussing on the Pacific coasts while only occasionally foraying further inland, seizing swathes of America in a peace deal while finally proving able to break Northern Yuan after many years. After that, their land forces finally started to hold a candle to their navy, and at the outbreak of total war they swept through Asia and never looked back. What makes the Chukchi such an exciting winner is that their success came from a very unique and very situational strategy; alongside Malacca, they’re the first civ to turn naval supremacy into something other than a brief exciting flash in the pan, using it to carve out a significant portion of the map. Congratulations to Lawtiliwadlin, as well as Senshi, who joins Firaxis and Pouakai in the hallowed hall of victorious mod creators. Though, er, he made the Marajoara too.
