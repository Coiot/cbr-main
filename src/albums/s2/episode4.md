    narration: "<p>Seventeen months later and the time has come again, X-Rok here to put some music between the notes. A new set of civs to write about, with some very interesting uniques, but this time they’re all still alive when my turn comes around. Last episode we saw a... concerning... amount of city razings and a couple nations approaching death’s door. What horrors will the wars of the cylinder bring? Let’s find out together.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode4-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>We begin with a view of the western Mediterranean, where Jerusalem defends against a coalition of Kosovo to the northwest and Hejaz to the south. Ibrahim Rugova’s army opts for the amphibious approach, embarking onto the sea to strike directly at the core. But Jerusalem holds position and lines the coast, ready to fend off the attack as they look for room for three Settlers to settle. Unfortunately for them they are mostly boxed in, the only option being some barren desert to the south between them and Hejaz.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode4-scene07.jpg
    narration: "<p>Andrés de Santa Cruz had a plan, and it was a bad one. His forward settle of Lima into the Mapuche core was razed, as many others were in the Millenium of Fire, and Lautaro was not content to end it with that. As his troops advance on La Paz, we can actually see the Mapuche UA, Legacy of Arauco, in action. Since discovering the Calendar, units that die on unimproved (or pillaged) tiles create their unique Chemamull improvement and claim the tile. We also see their unique Great General, the Toqui, to the south, the horse with the horizontal pixel diamond icon, which attacks as a melee unit… but can’t capture cities. Maratha’s next nearest melee unit is 5 turns away, so La Paz survives for now… but it’s land is another story.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Êlih is now firmly under Uzbek control, and the armies advance westward on Kurdistan. Ranjit Singh seems comfortable enough leaving the new city of Peshawar undefended, hoping the common war against Kurdistan will keep relations steady.</p><p></p><p>The Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent celebrates its completion of the Gate of the Sun, giving +1 gold and faith from Walls.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Dene and the Chinook declared war on Three Affiliated Tribes a couple turns ago, and now the troops advance. Four Bears has plenty of defense watching Comcomly’s push through the mountain pass, but perhaps should have been more prepared for their old enemy in the north as Seepoosha’s farmlands begin to be trampled by soldiers.</p>"

    narration: "<p>An uneasy calm runs through the air across southern north america. Mississippi and the Tongva are technically at war, but kept apart by Rio Grande and mountains.

    narration: "<p>Raja Raja I is not deterred by the recent Punjab aggressions, and re-settles Thiruvarur in its original location, now behind enemy lines. A handful of Chola units push to retake Nagapattinam, but lack the numbers to effectively fight the large force between there and the freshly settled Wazirabad.</p><p></p><p>Simon Bolivar and Lautaro agree to end their conflict in order to focus on other wars.</p>"

    scene_title: "Who Is Number Yuan?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode4-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Another strong UA shows itself, as Yuan’s Mandate Lost deals damage to all of Northern Yuan’s cities, proving that Yuan has at least all the tech that their aggressors do. This city damage appears to be forcing Mandukhai’s troops to retreat, as this army was last seen a little closer to Yuan borders when war was declared.</p><p></p><p>Punjab and Chola agree to peace, and Jamaica punches up across the continent as it declares war on the Mapuche. A naval assault perhaps?</p>"

    narration: "<p>It appears after Vercingetorix invaded and razed Santiago de Compostela, he intended to settle the area himself. But the Spanish Settler just off the coast has turned back and is currently in the ruins with an escort. The Gauls could settle where they are, and they do go first in the turn order, but maybe they are set on access to the Atlantic.</p><p></p><p>A small detachment of the Welsh navy harrasses Durocortorum, but poses no significant threat.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode4-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>The scramble for the Congo continues, with Namibia settling Rehoboth anew, this time a little closer to home. This leaves Zaire with plenty of jungle to lay claim to, but the only Settler in view is southwest of Bukavu, possibly making a break for the far southeast coast before the borders between the Lesotho cities converge.</p>"

    narration: "<p>This might be as close as Lautaro’s armies get, as the Peru-Bolivian reinforcements arrive to defend La Paz. One more tile was claimed via Legacy of Arauco, and now, even though the improvement graphic is not visible, the Mapuche have at least four tiles improved with Chemamulls to offer +1 culture and +2 faith in Peng Ko and Perken Ko… if they can keep enemy troops off them.</p><p></p><p>Zanzibar returns to peace as their war with Namibia ends.</p>"

    narration: "<p>And the Palmares fleet finds success! Kura Rewe is taken, and the Mapuche are left scrambling to attempt a recapture before it can recover too much. Three melee boats doesn’t do much for taking out those attackers though, so defense is all up to the city’s ranged attack.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Iceland’s colony in the new world has been hosting more and more troops, and now the time has come as war is declared on the Neutral Nation. The forces in and around Mosfellsbær are more than enough to overwhelm Niagara’s defenders, but taking a city of that size is another thing with only Archers and no siege weaponry.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Chukchi send a small fleet down to Erdemu be Aliha, but unlike Lautaro with Kura Rewe, Nurhaci has four ranged units nearby to support, making fending off only three ships a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Japan sends a Settler to the southern end of their own island, finally.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Further north, the Manchurian army pushes on Nagaoka, and if they commit they can succeed. This theatre of war should be a good display of the Chukchi’s Unique Ability, Enapyeratirghin: Units provide culture and damage adjacent enemies upon earning a Promotion, and may force units to retreat when starting within Chukchi territory. Killing enemy units adjacent to Chukchi borders claims that tile.</p><p></p><p>Played right, Nurhaci could add a few extra tiles to the city before capturing it.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode4-scene33.jpg
    narration: "<p>Relevant enough. A combat alliance with the Dene has given Purea the confidence to snap back at Hawaii, and troops flow into the ocean. Despite being a lone distant colony up against their opponent’s core, Tahiti has no problem sending naval support in the early game. Their UU Trireme replacement the Pahi, which you can see three of in the Fa’a’a waters, has the ability like Cargo Ships to change ports, allowing ships produced back in their south Pacific core to make the journey safely in one turn.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode4-scene35.jpg
    narration: "<p>Nigeria sends a couple Settlers with light escorts down the coast, a fairly safe proposition as Namibia had no coastal cities to produce ships… until now, as we witness the freshly founded city of Gibeon, which blocks off most of that coastline from being settled. The southern tip of Africa is still open, but a colony that far away, on the far side of an active war opponent, doesn’t often work out.</p>"

    narration: "<p>No reinforcements in sight, and six Triremes close in on Coolaroo. Vulnerable indeed. A couple of the fleeing melee units have escaped from the boats onto islands, and that Composite Bowman should be able to help from there. The Warrior replacement Diorite Axeman however might be better off back in the water fighting it out.</p><p></p><p>The InterYuan War comes to an end, and New Netherlands enter their first war as they declare on Rio Grande.</p>"
