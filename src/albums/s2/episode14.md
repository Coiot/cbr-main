Both have a pretty good chance of flipping back, as Madukhai has a pretty good navy on Lake Baikal, and some knights to do the capturing in Shangdu’s case. I know I sound like a broken record at this point, but this is going to be the maximum extent of Kolchak’s conquests here, as he has a severe lack of new units to bring to the front.</p>"

Back to the current war, while both armies seem sparse, Nigeria’s both more advanced and less sparse, this could be a repeat of the first war, but I doubt it. Burkina Faso will also peace out with the Vandals later this turn, so Sankara won’t have to deal with multiple fronts.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Marajoara declared war on Tahiti not too long ago, but P’kuee doesn’t seem to have came prepared. In fact, Puera is on the offensive, attacking her former city of Pora Pora and sending a fleet to attack Maracaibo. P’kuee probably has a fleet just off screen though, so this could end badly.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We get a shot of Japan for some reason, though it does show us that Kakuei’s army is sort-of outdated right now. Also  Yokohama seems undamaged, which is weird, thought it’d take some damage by now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Chukchi also declared war on Tahiti, and Fa’a’a is about to fa’a’all. The rest of the Chukchi fleet seems to be headed straight for Puera’s core, where they’ll do a lot of damage.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Mississippi and the Dene made peace, nothing seems to have been handed over in the deal, though Grand Village was in Thanadelthur’s hands when the deal happened. Not a good war for Tuskaloosa. And although Thanadelthur didn’t gain much “concrete” from this she did heavily damage her main rival, so I’d say it was worth it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sirnex is back in Zairian hands and Ta’if is about to be. Jeddah could also fall to Zaire after Ta’if does, but I doubt it. Also I just remembered that the Ptolomies had some African cities that either got handed over to Nigeria in the peace deal, or were captured by Nigeria and I just forgot about it, both very likely options.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ta’if falls to Zaire, eliminating Hejaz. Hussein bin Ali was slightly more interesting than von Salza, as he settled across the Gulf of Aden in the Horn of Africa, and neglected settling Arabia, can’t remember anything else though.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Fa’a’a has fa’a’allen to the Chukchi, giving Lawtiliwadlin complete control of Hawaii, which is more Hawaii than Hawaii ever had. Hopefully he can keep finishing the birth rights of other civs by taking over the rest of the Pacfic, starting with Tahiti, who should’ve been the one to do that a while ago.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We end this episode with a shot of Sankara’s hideout Gorom-Gorom. It looks like it’d be hell to live there, seeing how 17 pop is at least 5 million people, and it’s on Tristan da Cunha. There's a Vandalic fleet in the area, which having just learnt of the peace with Burkina Faso, are now investigating some weird protrusion behind the ice, luckily it’s not our weird protrusion though, there’s two for some reason.</p><p></p><p>And that’s the end of this episode. Hope you enjoyed it, because honestly I feel like I was a bit dry, but whatever. See you guys later</p>"
