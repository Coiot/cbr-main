    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene01.jpg
    narration: "<p>Greetings guys, gals, and nonbinary pals! It is I, u/Orangechrisy aka Orange aka the creator of Malacca, back again with part 5! Nearly two years ago I also narrated part 5 of CBRX so it’s great to be back for it again! Last time I just made the same joke a bunch of times and I guarantee I will make it once here too, but maybe this time there will be a bit more variance in my jokes. And now that I have full control over the narration, you won’t be able to escape my hardcore stanning of Malacca. </p><p></p><p>Between the time I write this and when the part comes out, another cakeday will have passed for me, and I gotta say, getting to narrate a part for the CBR is the best gift I’ve gotten in the past 2-3 years, I just love this community. So hooray for another year of CBR, and time to get on with the show!</p>"

    narration: "<p>u/X-Rok delivers us this fantastic rendition of the 5-on-5 beatdown of destiny. Will this big war lead to nothing or will Punjab come from behind with a steel chair and take out the competition? Will Kosovo get the drop on Georgia and force their submission? Will those mouths ever not be unsettling? And of course, will this distract us from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table? Find out this week on the CivBattleRoyale!</p><p></p><p>[The Following Contest is a Five on Five Coalition War - Imgur] (dont include this bit in the slide)</p>"

    narration: "<p>Punjab pushes PARG out of the top spot! They have good tech, good science, good pop, good army size, and good food, but most importantly, they have 14 cities and are tied for top production. They are a behemoth currently, but we’ll have to wait and see if they can manage to hold the top in the coming parts. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We start off this episode with a shot of the Burkina Faso war with the Tauregs, where Sankara looks to finally be setting his sights on the capital of Abalessa. He has a superior army, so it should just be a matter of time at this point. </p><p></p><p>On the sidebar we can see Tahiti making peace with Hawaii, and the minimap shows no changes in territory. </p>"

    scene_title: "Rumble in the Jungle"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene07.jpg
    narration: "<p>Zumbi makes quite the bold declaration of war against Paraguay, he has a slight advantage in troops but his units aren’t near the front at all. The two are evenly matched for the most part, so perhaps Zumbi was a bit too preemptive in starting his strike. Either way, this will certainly be a deciding war should one of the two actually come out on top instead of just a quick peace. </p>"

    scene_title: "Colossal Headway"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Olmecs batter Portmore down to red but Garvey has finally brought his navy around to mount a defense. By the looks of things, Jamaica will stand strong and perhaps even follow up with a greater invasion of Papaloapan. But there is still a chance my desire of a Caribbean Olmec empire will come true, so may Portmore fall. </p>"

    scene_title: "Firezaj"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>The bolsheviks take and burn Mtskheta from Kosovo, and Georgia has a settler at the ready to replace what was originally theirs. Lenin also pushes on Ferizaj and Peje with a cavalry attack. The native Ukrainians of the region feel a sense of deja vu but can’t quite figure out why. </p>"

    scene_title: "Effortless Defense"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>It seems for whatever reason the Anangu plan of sending their large army in the sea isn’t helping them, absolutely shocking. Tjilpi instead faces Uluru and dreams with all his might that Mutitjulu is saved. Sadly for him, the gods won’t save him and he sent his army to drown off the coast of New Guinea. William Barak sits at home and laughs heartily at the incompetent enemy he is fighting. </p>"

    scene_title: "The Olmecs getting more ports"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>My desires were answered! Portmore falls! Jamaica still has five boats surrounding the city compared to the Olmecs two barely alive boats. But it’s something! </p><p></p><p>On the side we see that Toypurina has made peace with Lautaro with no cities changing hands, and Solano desires more opponents and decides to send a couple of rather strongly worded letters to Garvey suggesting at his idiocy at letting Portmore fall to the Olmecs. Garvey promptly throws the letters out, missing the one declaring war, thinking they were just junk mail. </p>"

    scene_title: "Manchu “manning” up"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Kublai Khan forgot how to push and has retreated a few tiles. Perhaps he is gearing up for another attack, or perhaps those units in the water are planning a naval invasion. Either way, Nurhaci celebrates a successful defense by getting incredibly drunk and boasting to anyone within hearing range about how terrible Kublai is. A wonderful night. </p><p></p><p>While this may have happened earlier, on the minimap I spot another city in Patagonia founded by Palmares. The Mapuche are really quickly losing out on the free real estate that they had. New Netherlands also found a city in Labrador.</p>"

    scene_title: "Dead men tell no tales"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>In the dead of night, Tjilpi gets onto a horse and quietly leaves town. His capital is on the verge of death with spearmen and horses knocking down it’s doors. He wishes he could have done more, but refuses to admit that his plan to drown his army was bad. He whispers “Scurvy makes you stronger. Scurvy makes you stronger.” as a reassurance to himself as he goes. </p><p></p><p>The citizens of Coolaroo wonder why they haven’t been attacked yet despite being surrounded on three sides by enemies. “Perhaps we made peace.” they think and return to their daily routines. </p>"

    scene_title: "Perfection"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>Mmm. Wonderful. Absolutely stunning. Just perfect. Lovely. Malacca holds Hai Phong, and doesn’t raze it this time. Vietnam doesn’t have the ability to take it back so it’s ours for the keeping. Mansur’s navy makes its way to the Gulf of Ha Noi, where it will likely begin to pressure Saigon. It doesn’t seem likely they will be able to take much more with the lack of water access and jungle terrain, but they shall at least hold Hai Phong. I love to see my bois doing well. </p><p></p><p>In non-Malacca related news (bleh), Taiping becomes the first to colonize the Philippines, perhaps Malacca will follow. </p>"

    scene_title: "Mutitju-lose"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>William Barak stands at the base of Uluru, having been unable to find Tjilpi, he resigns his search and assumes the coward abandoned his people. A shame, he had wanted to greet the leader personally and tell him thanks for joining in William’s foray into fighting on land. His failure to fight Malacca still rested on him but he patted himself on the back with his accomplishments here. If only he wasn’t on an island he may have been able to replicate this strategy against more foes. </p><p></p><p>On the side bar we see Lesotho having decided to throw a pin at a map and fight whoever it landed on declaring war on Hejaz, and Georgia and Kosovo putting aside their differences as Kosovo started getting spooked about the Red Army at his doorstep. Not seen is Laos attacking Bhutan, and Bhutan attacking Northern Yuan. </p>"
  - scene_number: 16
    scene_title: "Pristine Invasion"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Ferdinand I lands a large army onto Greece and brings a large navy into the Aegean Sea. Ibrahim Rugova is startled at how fast it appeared and has no means to fight it. Too late he realizes that his capital may fall. </p><p></p><p>On the side we see that Barghash bin Said realized that his father was the sultan of Oman living in Zanzibar and he decided that it was time to retake his homeland. Meanwhile, Hejaz makes peace with the Ptolemies, Uzbekistan, and Punjab, and instead starts a fight with the far off Northern Yuan. PARG and Taiping attack Bhutan while Punjab makes peace with Bhutan. Spain attacks Wales.  </p>"

    scene_title: "The Mostest Amazing List"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Noted Babylonian agent of the sub, Pythagoras, has created his greatest work yet, and oh boy is it great. He has scoured every continent in search of every civ’s technology, and has put together a list of who has the most. As expected, Mansur Shah leads the pack, of course. Malaccan supremacy shall continue to reign! No one can escape their dominance!</p><p></p><p>Other than our amazing top leader, the Chukchi, Vandals, Nigeria, and the Mississippi all come in second place with 20 techs. The info sheet updated to the last part shows Nigeria, the Vandals, and Malacca leading the way in terms of effective science, with Germany and the Chukchi a bit behind. It’s a tough race at the top here. Somalia and Jerusalem sit at the far back.</p>"

    scene_title: "Dambra-dang-a"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Zumbi’s declaration of war is backfiring against him, at least at his core. Paraguay brings Dambrapanga down to red, although they don’t look to have the troops to take it. In addition, it looks like Zumbi has, if anything, moved troops away and towards Marajoara. Things aren’t looking good for our guys in green.</p><p></p><p>On the side we see Nigeria building Chicken Pizza, and Punjab and Manchu call it quits once they realize that there are three civs between them. </p>"

    scene_title: "Vikings in the Americas"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>Iceland takes on New Netherlands in a battle of the two naval powers. However, this shot doesn’t show the whole story. Iceland may have little power near the Dutch capital, but they are more likely gunning for the settles in northern Quebec. I don’t doubt that Iceland will take those two cities, but New Netherlands may be able to make a decent push north if they try. </p>"

    scene_title: "Behch-ohno"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>Here we can see the TAT gave away Seepoosha to the Chinook and it’s immediately put into peril as the Dene attack, also putting the pressure on Kanyak. However, Behchoko is in danger as well.</p><p></p><p>William Barak, to commemorate his capture of Mutitjulu, builds Petra a fair bit away in a likely more useless city for the wonder. Mansur Shah also builds the Oracle of Bintan, and upon asking for a prophecy, the Pythoness responds “You are the best, and you will be the one who takes over this simu-... world”. He wonders what the Pythoness meant when she stopped herself, but he didn’t dwell on it further.</p><p></p><p>Hidden, Northern Yuan and PARG make peace, and Palmares and Paraguay make peace, neither with any gifting of cities.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Bhutan is facing quite the large threat from Taiping here, Gelephu already being hit and surrounded, it’ll fall soon. Their other cities are luckily protected by mountains, but that by no means means they’re safe. </p><p></p><p>On the side Tuskaloosa declares war on the Neutrals, saying “We were going to settle that land but then we found you already on it, so give your land to us.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we see Mississippi launching an attack with the settlers. Tuskaloosa calls it a “bold new strategy” that will “take the Neutrals by surprise” and will take no questions.</p><p></p><p>Kinderhoek starts to take damage as the Icelandic fleet batters its walls. But Peter Stuyvesant sends a large number of troops at the Iceland outpost of Mosfellsbaer. There is a good chance they will take it I think, given how open it is to a naval attack.</p><p></p><p>Chola hops out of one useless war and into another. </p>"

    narration: "<p>William Barak, still unsure where the Anangu army is supposed to be, is starting to wonder if maybe war is just like this and why he didn’t do this sooner. He still hasn’t quite figured boats out yet as his navy attempts to take the landlocked city of Amata.</p><p></p><p>Tjilpi on the other hand is hiding out in Warakurna madly muttering to himself that his plan was perfect and that his people just didn’t have enough faith. Yes, that must be it, they lacked the faith. If only they had more faith the plan would have worked. If only. IF ONLY. A few of his citizens stand outside the shack he is holed up in wondering if they should tell him that he’s not in the governmental building he is supposed to be at.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Five turns since we last saw this war, Pristina has dropped to yellow and Ibrahim has finally brought over some units for defense. The Italian navy has seemingly disappeared from the Aegean so they just might be able to pull off a successful defense, but it’s looking tight. Ferdinand issues a declaration of “You should just give me it.” which is received with blank stares and a loud “No.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>William Barak proclaims a feast for the capture of Pukatja. However, in the partying, William accidentally knocks over a candle which quickly starts a large fire that reaches all through town. He escapes the fire and turns around to solemnly look upon the burning ruins of what was his. It was an abandoned city he thought, so maybe it was meant to be. </p><p></p><p>Tjilpi’s underlings managed to pull him out from where he was and get him to the governmental building he needed to be in to lead. But his men seemed scared of him, as he continued to mutter things about “scurvy”, “faith”, “the plan”, and “the sea”. </p>"

    scene_title: "Pontianak is not yet Laost"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene27.jpg
    narration: "<p>Ignoring my attempt at a pun in the title, the war between Laos and VOC has grinded to a standstill it seems, Pontianak in the yellow but Laos seemingly unable to push further. The small area and hilly lands offer a surprising amount of protection.</p><p></p><p>In the east, Vietnamese troops have been pushed away from Hai Phong and Vietnam instead decides to try and found a city on Hainan. Given that Taiping land, they will most likely settle in one of the two southern provinces which would make it an easy grab for Malacca. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Vercingetorix catches Llywelyn by complete surprise with a massive invasion across the sea towards Abertawe. Seems like Vercingetorix promised Llywelyn that he wouldn’t attack if was allowed to settle three whole cities in Northern England and Llywelyn took the bait. The Gauls are about to become the ruler of Britain it seems.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Supremely Strong Settler Strategy"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>The settler invasion strategy by Tuskaloosa is rather shockingly a failure and Tuskaloosa is forced to actually send his army on the attack. In the meantime, Tsouharissen manages to take Etowah before the settler strategy is realized to not work. The Great Lakes should provide Kandoucho the natural defense needed to stay safe, so as long as they can make peace without Mississippi retaking Etowah (which seems unlikely), then this war will have been a big profit for the currently ranked 58th civ and a massive failure for the currently ranked 5th civ.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>William Barak seems to be tempting fate by sending his settler ever closer to the Tahiti core. Perhaps if he gets too close Tahiti will put their navy to use and actually take a city for once. </p>"

    scene_title: "One Million Elephants and a White Pontianak"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene31.jpg
    narration: "<p>Perhaps I spoke too soon for Pontianak, they are dropped further into the yellow and more elephants swarm the gates. Perhaps I should have taken a closer look at the abilities of the civ since Laos’ great general replacement spawns two war elephants with it and the war elephants have 100% combat strength against cities and double movement through forest and jungle. AKA, those two elephants can do a whole lot of damage. Jan Coen needs to pick them off before it’s too late.</p><p></p><p>Also, Malacca showing off their new Galleass in their capital. Means they finally got Compass (which they didn’t have when Pythagoras’ list came out). First in the world to the tech, and their tech dominance, means they will be the masters of the sea for quite some time. </p>"

So while Llywelyn sends an entourage to Murcia, Vercingetorix pushes on both Abertawe and Caernarfon. Carlos may be able to sneak in and grab Caernarfon with a boat, but either way, Wales is falling hard. </p>"

William’s army has more or less dissipated after he had them all head home and ignore the burning of the city. </p><p></p><p>The citizens of Amata, after realizing the insanity of Tjilpi and the lack of communications coming from Warakurna, proclaim their own republic.

Multiple horsemen and swordsmen sit outside the city in wait for the walls to finally be able to be breached. It’s been a long war but Burkina Faso is going to have very big gains from this war. After their initial rise and fall, it seems they are back to having a very strong position in Africa. </p><p></p><p>On the side we can see the nearby Nigeria has built The Churches of Lalibela, a wonder which provides +3 faith, +1 great artist point, and +1 faith from all specialists.</p>"

The city will fall very soon.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere on this slide, we see the Gauls sending another settler into the North Sea, Germany sending a settler to Scotland, and Germany saying “Screw you” to the people of Cenabum by citadelling them twice. </p>"

    narration: "<p>I stand corrected once more about my previous prediction! The Olmecs hold the city and only a single Olmec trireme sits nearby. A wonderful starting point for a Caribbean empire. Also, for what it’s worth, the city flipped once as far as I can tell in the logs. </p><p></p><p>New Netherlands, while fighting in the north, also settle Cuba. Jamaica really let us down on the settling game but no one had any expectations of them in the first place so I guess it’s not so bad. </p>"

Rejoice at progress in the Himalayas, but also don’t rejoice as another orange colored civ has lost a city and as Orange herself, I feel the need to defend the civs that are the best color. </p><p></p><p>On the side we see that Iceland (and hidden TAT) have declared useless wars on the Olmecs. It seems they may have both been smuggling money through a rum distillery called “Bear and Vikingr” in Portmore that got found out when the city fell. </p><p></p><p>We also see Laos and VOC making peace, with no change in cities. </p>"

And it is a huge counterattack. Kublai Khan seems to just have forgotten that he was at war with the Manchu and has moved his armies away. Truly a devastating combination.

    narration: "<p>Up in the north, Seamysty falls to the icy marauders. Now comes the difficult part of pushing through the small gap they have to Cathlamet. While losing this one city does hurt the Chinook, it was a small city and they have more land to settle. But they are lucky that the Chukchi are forced through this small hole as otherwise their entire western side would be flooded by light blue units. </p><p></p><p>On the side we see that the Olmecs and Jamaica have made peace, and looking at the minimap the Olmecs seem to have secured Portmore. Kosovo also makes peace with Two Sicilies and keep Pristina, good job Ferdinand I shouldn’t have put hope in you. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Al Bahah flips back and forth as Hejaz starts bringing over more of an army. With how little Somalia is sending in the way of forces, Hejaz may actually hold the city in the end. They have the boats and ranged units necessary to keep taking it down and Somalia is just sending spearmen and warriors. </p><p></p><p>Marajoara builds the Hagia Sophia and I think they don’t have the religious upgrade yet so they will likely grab that. Cleopatra is also looking to settle Ethiopia before Zaire takes all of it.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We see the front again, Somalia is looking like they are in fact sending more units, so they will likely take the city back but it’s still up in the air if they will hold it in the end.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Hejaz also sends another settler towards Ethiopia. On the side we see that Bhutan made peace with Laos, a number of useless wars began against Vietnam, and the Chinook and Chukchi made peace.</p>"

    scene_title: "A much bloodier Toledo War"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene88.jpg
    narration: "<p>Cordoba is burnt to a crisp, it’s people largely killed en masse. The Vandals also drop Toledo quickly to yellow and it’s citizens become very scared for their lives. The Vandals will likely burn the city down too. It must suck to be in Iberia at this point, to the north the Gauls just burned the Welsh to the ground, and to the south the Vandals are doing the same to them. In the midst of this, Nan Madol is built by Genseric in celebration granting +2 culture, +1 great engineer points, and +1 food, gold, and production in Leptis Magna where they built it. </p><p></p><p>On the side, Iceland and New Netherlands peace out, with New Netherlands taking Mosfellsbaer and keeping Kinderhoek, a massive win. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Taiping has broken through the mountains and jungles and has brought Ha Noi down to red with a number of troops surrounding it. The city is near guaranteed to fall. Ho Chi Minh and his troops retreat to Sai Gon which will likely be much harder to take for Taiping if they continue the war. </p>"

    narration: "<p>On the isles, the last holdout of the Welsh has begun to be bombarded. The nearly million people in the city know what’s about to happen to them and all they can do is hope that Vercingetorix is merciful for once. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Spain is making an exodus from Iberia and has three settlers in the area, likely ready to quickly resettle Ireland once Casnewydd is burned to the ground. It’s a bit of a cruel part of life where the Welsh will very quickly be replaced by incoming Spanish, soon their culture will no longer exist in the world.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Mississippi army, upon reaching Sukhutit, immediately drop it to red. Sanish is also in the deep red. In response, instead of moving to defend themselves, TAT founds a New Town. The town doesn’t even have time to be given a proper name before Mississippi units surround it. Four Bears what are you doing?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Quite a lot of capitals are falling this part, this time it’s Ha Noi falling to a Taiping horseman. Taiping has a large army still on the march but the mountain near Viang Chan and the many rivers will make that army useless unless it goes over sea. </p><p></p><p>On the side, Ferdinand, after failing to take Pristina like an idiot, decides instead to attack the crumbling Spanish. But they are unlikely to gain much in the war before the Vandals get to it. </p>"

    narration: "<p>TAT, continuing to ignore their southern front, finally do some damage to Seepoosha, bringing it to green. But while doing so, the Mississippi have taken Sukhutit and decided to burn it down. Sanish and New Town are next on the chopping block, solid chance they too get burned. There is a lot of razing in this game and the Mississippi are just going to do it more on their path of destruction. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene94.jpg
    narration: "<p>Toledo falls to the Vandals and they surprisingly don’t burn it down. It seems a one pop city was small enough to not put them in the negatives. Now the push inland shall commence, as their mass of troops around the coast begins to push in. Ferdinand was really too late as his only option for attack was snatched in front of him. Really letting us down here Ferdinand. Come on Ferdinand.</p>"

    scene_title: "War of Attrition"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene95.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malmo drops to yellow but only a few Triremes sit outside it with ranged units in the city. Wilhelm has decided that his best move is to found a new city on the frontline, Posen, and it is a solid move as any approaching triremes can be shot at with it and it can produce more boats. Sweden on the other hand has Gothenburg even more surrounded but is still yet to start damaging it. They seem to be having better luck in the naval fight but even that is unlikely to lead anywhere. This is ultimately a war of death for those fighting and no gains for either side. </p>"

    scene_title: "Finding happiness in the darkest times"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode5-scene96.jpg
    narration: "<p>The great Babylonian Pliny has made his way around the world searching for happiness, and on his travels he compiled a list of which civs like to smile the most. At the top of the list we have Bhutan, who even after losing a city to Taiping, is nearly twice as happy as the Welsh. Wait why are the Welsh so happy after their country burned to the ground, are they masochist pyromaniacs? I guess so. </p>"

    narration: "<p>TAT continues to fail at doing much against Seepoosha. The Dene also decide to have some fun and citadel it. </p><p></p><p>On the side, Malacca attacks Bhutan and they have a chance to do something in the Bay of Bengal potentially, so hopefully they can. There’s also hidden Northern Yuan making peace with far off enemies and a few people not close to Spain attacking them. </p>"

    narration: "<p>And there we hit it, the final slide of this part. We get a nice overview shot of a location really not seen much in this part, South America, and the massive Paraguayan army along with the surrounding Mapuche cities. If Solano wanted to, he could likely attack any of his neighbors and win handily with an army of this size, so hopefully that happens. </p><p></p><p>What a wonderful part of bloodshed, burning, madness, and destruction this was. I hope that I did not make this too painful to read through and that I provided some enjoyment to everyone. I had fun writing some more narrative bits to this like Tjilpi’s madness, hopefully people liked it and that it wasn’t just a waste that was useless to write. </p><p></p><p>Anyways, a huge thank you to BC for letting me narrate and for making the CBR possible, and thank you to the community, I love you all. And remember, there was no Malaccan bias here, none at all. Praise be Malacca!</p>"
