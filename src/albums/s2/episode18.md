    narration: "<p>Pozdrav svima i dobrodošli* to the Civ Battle Royale X Season 2 Episode 18. Your narrator today is BV, or u/anarcho-balkan on Reddit. </p><p></p><p>Although officially joining the community only in October 2019 upon making my reddit account, I have functionally been a member-lurker of the community for 4 years longer than that, since the early days of Mk2. Throughout all iterations of the Royale, I’ve had something of a tendency to switch sides once per season: in Mk2, I was first rooting for the Yakuts, before switching to Vietnam; in CBRX1, it was first Palmyra, before switching to the Moors; now in CBRX2, I initially threw my lot in with the Kurds, before joining the Malacca fan-club. </p><p></p><p>My most well known contribution to the community was a shitpost I made to honour the Seljuqs’ death in CBRX S1 back in January 2020, which, despite being my first, somehow ended up as OC of the week. All things considered, you probably know me better from Discord than from Reddit. </p><p></p><p>Enough about me though, you’re here for the action. *TL note: “pozdrav svima i dobrodošli” means “greetings all and welcome” in Serbocroatian. </p>"

    narration: "<p>On our first real slide of the episode, we see that, despite (or perhaps because of) the mutual nuking, the Marajoara-Kulin War seems to be quieting down. There’s still some action, like between those Kulin ships (I think they’re destroyers?) and Marajoaran embarked units, but overall, the war seems to have hit an impasse, as Paraguayan and, to a far lesser extent, Missippian peacekeepers have closed off most avenues of action.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene07.jpg
    narration: "<p>Here we see the German-Sicilian War in all its sloggy glory. Though Germany visibly has an edge, having gained Teramo since the war had started last episode, their efforts to hold onto it and Alesia are frustrated by the sea of mostly North-Yuan and Ptolemaic peacekeepers, with some mandatory Uzbeks thrown in for flavour. Two Sicilies has troops in position to capture either city, but their chances aren’t exactly the best, given they have just one unit next to Terami, while their chances at Alesia will be handicapped by the small but advanced German army and fleet nearby. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>Press F to pay your respects to New Netherlands. They were once among the more powerful contestants in North America, ruling the entire eastern seaboard and much of the Caribbean, fighting multiple wars with the Neutrals and even fought Rio Grande to a stalemate once. However, the first war with the Vandals, which initially seemed to be a mere series of raids - destructive ones, mind you, but still just that - eventually turned heavily against them, losing most of their empire. Most of what was left was then swiftly gobbled up by Rio Grande. They survived for a time in their 2 remaining cities, one of them being their rival Neutral Nation’s capital, until the Vandals came once more, taking Barnde Gat and eliminating the Neutrals at Niagara last episode, before moving in for the kill at Kandoucho, eliminating the New Dutch at 43rd and taking the OG Neutral capital in a single move. Beaver season is over my friends, but the memory of the New Dutch will live on, and I hope Stuyvesant finds his new place in the submarine cozy. F.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Predictably, the Sicilians are yet to capture Teramo. Worse, it seems they won’t be getting Alesia anytime soon, as I spy an Uzbek unit (possibly a vertol, IIRC) in the city. </p><p></p><p>On the sidebar, we’re informed that Mansur Shah has constructed a wonder, the Virtual Idol, in the city of Pahang.

    narration: "<p>Here we see the end of the Kulin-Marajoaran War, and the Kulin have secured a nice foothold on the South American continent, much to my chagrin (since I was cheering for Marajoara in this war, but, oh well, you can’t get all, I guess). </p><p></p><p>Also, Mansur Shah and Cleopatra made peace. </p>"

    scene_title: "Labrodorian Wastes"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Up here in the Labrador peninsula’s hinterlands, IRL a sparsely populated land of forests and lakes, the last of the Mississipians live in mostly medium-to-large cities. Though they still have an army, their main defence comes in the form of the Paraguayan peacekeepers, with some Anangu refugees also tagging along. </p><p></p><p>The most these guys seem to worry about are Dene air raids at their smallest remaining city, Slack Farm, and to a smaller degree the middling city of Long Swamp. There’s also a Dene paratrooper in the very middle of the Long Swamp - Andachkhrob - Staten Eylant triangle. However, the biggest threat to the Mississippi seems to come from the south, as the Vandal conquests and the Dene-Vandal open borders agreement have opened up a two-tile gap that the remnants of the Mississippian army have no choice but to fill themselves, as the positioning of themselves, the Paraguayan peacekeepers and the Anangu refugees doesn’t allow for movement of units. Luckily, the Dene are yet to arrive at this frontier, and there’s yet to be indication of their arrival in large enough numbers to push through. </p><p></p><p>Off in the sidebar, Tuscaloosa and P’küee declare war on U Kix Chaan’s city-state, while Lenin builds the Utsäde Gene Vault in Moscow. </p>"

    scene_title: "Red Sea Scuffle"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>On this slide, we see a small group of Zairian units push through the Uzbek peacekeeper carpet to capture Hermoupolis from the Sicilians. However, a small Sicilian fleet and a lone Kurdish peshmerga UU are just outside the city walls, so flipping is still possible. At least until the Uzbeks settle in. </p>"

    scene_title: "Southern Ocean"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene14.jpg
    narration: "<p>Not sure what we’re supposed to see here exactly. The Chola have this Antarctic base they’ve taken from Zanzibar and then retaken from the Ptolemies, while Kulin boasts a large carpet with only a few gaps, two of which are filled by Paraguayans, as well as impressive city defenses, but otherwise this slide seems to exist just to calm us with its peaceful atmosphere. Probably won’t last into the next slide, but still, it is nice. </p>"

    scene_title: "RSS 2"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene15.jpg
    narration: "<p>As expected, the Uzbeks immediately settled in, but not to the same degree as I feared, as the Sicilians have sent enough units to seriously challenge the Zairian hold over Hermoupolis. The Sicilians, Zairians and Kurds are all positioned in such a way that the Uzbeks aren’t as much of a hindrance to the conflict as they could’ve been. I’m also glad to see that our peshmerga friend had earned a promotion. </p>"

    scene_title: "Antarctic Waves"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Here we see the forgotten Zanzibari Antarctic colony and now capital, Pangani, and why the Chola never reached it - Kulin borders surround it, and Chola doesn’t seem to have open borders with the Kulin. Judging by the population numbers, far from being in an isolated polar hell, the Zanzibaris have managed to turn this into a small winter wonderland. Although the view on the map says otherwise, I’m gonna let my wishful thinking take the better of me and assume they found some useful resource they could use for trade, while also adapting their housing and environment to accommodate both the local climate and the population. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Tongva, Bhutan and Northern Yuan make peace with Laos, only for Nigeria, Bhutan and Northern Yuan to turn their gazes to the Chinook, while Burkina Faso decided to join the anti-Olmec coalition. What might’ve initially seemed like an irrelevant war however quickly turns otherwise, as the NYAPPF (North-Yuan American Pacific Peace Force) turns into the NYAPEF (North-Yuan American Pacific Expeditionary Force), attacking the current Chinook capital of Clatsop. With the Chinook army outnumbered and outdated, their only hope for survival are geography and the regional armies of the neutral powers. </p>"

    scene_title: "Big Stick Syndrome"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>The title of this slide is a reference to an episode of the same name from the early days of Mk2, and I will be dropping a few more in this slide’s text too. </p><p></p><p>Alberti has made a list of people with pointiest sticks, that is, most powerful armies. By far the biggest stick is the Kulin’s one, being twice as big as #8 PARG’s one. Places 5-7, being Uzbekistan, the Marajoara and Rio Grande, all have similarly large sticks, visibly bigger than PARG’s. USSR’s stick is a little bit bigger than their sticks and Malacca’s a little bit bigger than USSR’s. Nigeria’s stick is visibly bigger than Malacca’s, but it’s still plenty smaller than the Kulin’s. </p><p></p><p>However, it remains to be seen how these sticks are used. As Texas had taught Canada in Mk2, it’s not about how big your stick is, it’s how you use it. </p>"

    scene_title: "Womb of Nations"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>In IRL history, many ancient Germanic peoples claimed to have hailed from southern Scandinavia, and there is good evidence to suggest that this area on the Baltic and North Sea coasts, as well as some of the areas just south of this shot were the homeland of the Proto-Germanics. Whether the historians, archeologists and anthropologists of the cylinder would agree with us or not we will never know, but one thing is for sure - the Germans are the rulers of this area’s seas. On land, it’s somewhat different - sure, the cities are all German, but the army is a mix of North-Yuan, Kulins, Yuan and Uzbeks. I wonder how the local Germans and Germanized Swedes feel about all that. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Tongva, Burkina Faso and Kosovo declare war on the Chinook, and Tongva also declares war on the Olmecs. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we have a view of Southern Vandalmerica and the eastern provinces of Rio Grande. Both seem to be decently developed, with mostly mid-sized cities, plenty of units and some foreign vacationers, peacekeepers and refugees. We also see the Riograndese defence bug in full force here, with Nieuw Amstel at 618 defence. </p>"

    scene_title: "Isthmian Struggles"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>Due to a combination of heavy terrain, mild bordergore, a few peacekeepers and their own citadels being pillaged by the recent Kulin war, the Marajoara are struggling to get their units to Olmec land. Tonalá has taken some damage though, either from the Marajoaran air force in Portmore or the damaged artillery unit that has managed to make its way into Olmec territory. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Dene has managed to find a route towards the Mississipians, but the Vandal units in the St. Lawrence river valley and in and around the St. Lawrence Gulf are making progress difficult. Still this promises some progress towards the now zero-health city of Long Swamp- waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiit a minute... Is that fallout I see? How are the Paraguayans undamaged and subsequently not at war with Dene rn? Is this a remnant from an earlier nuke that me and the previous narrators failed to notice? Or is it some kinda bug?</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Sicilians have somehow taken Alesia, and, despite the sparsity of their own forces there, they seem like they’ll probably hold it, as the German forces remaining around it are just as if not more sparse, and I’m 90% sure none of the German units in Alesian territory are melee ones. </p><p></p><p>Oh, and the Soviets and Palmarians peaced out.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Zairian airstrikes from Silêmanî have battered Hewlêr to the black and Qamişlo to the red, while Kurdish artillery made sure Sine didn’t recover from the Zairian capture. However, any progress by either Zaire or the Kurdish-Sicilian alliance is prevented by all the peacekeepers, most of them Uzbeks and Lesothoans, but with some Zanzibaris and Paraguayans present too. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we have another peaceful slide, viewing the carpeted peacekeeping giant, Uzbekistan, the also carpeted rump, Georgia, the USSR’s barren southern lands and Kosovar Kuban being carpeted by North-Yuan forces instead of Kosovar ones. </p><p></p><p>As for the notifications, Punjab and Laos have made peace, while the USSR and, more relevantly, Lesotho had declared war on Chola. Chola has a large and powerful navy, but there are a lot of Lesothoan paratroopers in their territory, including their very heartland, so we’ll see how that goes. </p><p></p><p>Also, Finland now has nuclear weapons capabilities. </p>"

    scene_title: "Madagascar Sea Warfare"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>Here the situation seems rather obvious - Lesotho has the clear edge on land due to sheer numbers, but Chola rules the waves. Still, it’s questionable as to if that is gonna last, given the massive Lesothoan Air Force in the area, compared to the minimal Chola Air Force presence here. Now, one of the many notification sheets Coiot has provided me says that Lesotho takes Malindi from Chola during this very turn, but the minimap doesn’t confirm that, at least not yet. I guess we should keep our eyes on the minimap during the next few slides to get concrete confirmation. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The former peacekeepers that had helped Chola defend from Punjab have now turned on those they’ve been protecting, but the situation isn’t nearly as dire for the Chola as I might’ve thought. Anuradhapura has suffered a little bit of damage, but Chola has plenty of forces of its own to throw at the problem. Any Lesothoan reinforcements will need to go through waters infested by the Chola navy, however, and I don’t like their chances. Also, we immediately get minimap confirmation that Malindi has, indeed, fallen to Lesotho. The sheets never lie. They just fumble the diacritic’d letters. </p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode18-scene30.jpg
    narration: "<p>This turn, Punjab and Taiping have declared war on Bhutan. Trashigang, Samtse and Thimphu had already been weakened by the previous wars with Uzbekistan and Lesotho, and air runs by Punjab had brought them all the way to black. Thimphu and Samtse will almost certainly hold, due to the mountains and North-Yuan peacekeepers, but Trashigang, on the wrong side of a mountain range and with no peacekeepers to speak of, is ripe for the taking. Our favourite Bhutanese city seems like it won’t be Bhutanese for long. </p>"

Army groups Burma and Kra are pillaging their respective areas of operations, while army group Cambodia is trying to capture Pakse. Something tells me that that’s not gonna work out in their favour. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here, we see that both sides’ navies are duking it out in the cylinder’s nether regions (that sounded much less dirty in my head). A small Lesothoan fleet accompanying their embarked army are moving towards Soerbaja, but I don’t like their chances against the large Chola fleet there. Meanwhile, a section of the Cholan Subantarctic fleet is moving towards Marakabei, but a combination of not-sending-enough ships and a Malaccan fleet partially in the way means that the Lesothoan Antarctic city is probably not in danger of falling yet. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here, we see that Lesotho has captured Dar es Salaam, and their army is tightening the noose around Zanzibar. However, their hold on Malindi isn’t secure just yet either, as some Chola units are still on the mainland, and the local Chola fleet will probably sink plenty of those embarked units trying to surround and capture Zanzibar. </p><p></p><p>Off in the sidebar, Rio Grande and Finland had joined the anti-Chola coalition, while the Sicilian-Ptolemaic war officially comes to a close. </p>"

    narration: "<p>After skipping the relatively uneventful turn 580, we see that turn 581 has some interesting events. </p><p></p><p>First off, we see Trashigang falling to the Punjabis. However, the militants of the Trashy Gang, supported by the regular Bhutanese army, still hold sway in parts of its countryside, and are determined to retake their hometown. Whether they will or not remains to be seen. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Sankara and Comcomly peace out, while Punjab declares war on Paraguay. As I’ve already been spoiled by the CBRX Arc Four Narrators group chat on Discord, I have a very bad feeling about this. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Chola navy continues to dominate in these waters, puting Malealea in the red, Roma in the yellow and Thaba Tseka in the green. The former two are likely to fall, due to the local Cholan numerical superiority, but a single Cholan ship won’t be enough to capture the latter. This isn’t helped by the fact that Chola reinforcements have been intercepted by a Lesothoan fleet, and for once it’s actually mostly an actual fleet, and not some collection of embarked land units. </p>"

Tonalá is in the red, so a city capture is possible, and that capture being a complete elimination isn’t beyond the realm of possibility. </p>"

The Pacific Front is now moving towards the Marajoaran cities in Colombia. The Marajoaran navy is gonna have many easy pickings with this many embarked units, but the fact that there are so many embarked units may actually be a legit threat, even when unaccompanied. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Marajoaran Army has captured Tonalá, and with no Olmec units in sight, we can safely declare the Olmecs eliminated at 42nd. The Olmecs were never really a contender for the win. They founded a rather successful religion, but they never expanded beyond their initial home. Their empire, if one can even call it that, was chipped away from multiple times, most notably with Rio Grande taking the Olmec capital. The Olmecs somehow managed to survive the incursions of the New Dutch by dumb luck (read: border gore) back when the latter were a powerhouse, and now somehow managed to outlive their assailants from several episodes ago. In a weird peace treaty, they gave Palmares one of their only two remaining cities, and were soon joined by them in the city-state club. There, they resided, until the Marajoarans decided to get rid of a rump that just so happened to also be a religious rival. They may have had big heads, but their brains didn’t increase proportionally with them. One could only assume their hearts did, given the peace with Palmares, but we will never know. Now, U Kix Chaan is on his way to the submarine. Rest in heads, Olmecs. F. </p>"

I hope this isn’t the last pre-Endgame episode, because that collection of units is giving me flashbacks to the last pre-E slides of CBRX S1. We better remain inside the sub for now, and if any of us decides to get out, the best way would be to just pull a “Penguins of Madagascar” and smile and wave to the cameras.

If memory serves right, they briefly played a role in the carve-up of the Three Affiliated Tribes, of which the Dene were the main beneficiary. They then sat there, fishing salmon, occasionally skirmishing non-committedly with equally uncommitted neighbours and developing at a less than adequate speed. It all changed when the Chukchi attacked. They lost the majority of their empire to a combination of the mighty Chukchi Navy and small but advanced Chuckhi land divisions. What was left would be chipped away by a Tongva invasion, the Chukchi UA and possibly a relatively minor attack by at least one of the civs east of the Rockies. Their death, however, came not from any of their American neighbours nor the Chukchi who had brought them so low, but by unfamiliar Mongols who held a weak claim on the Mandate of Heaven.

They’re also much more exposed in case of another war, as many of the Paraguayan peacekeepers and Anangu refugees have been booted out with the peace, and those who stayed are now mostly turned in the Vandal direction. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, over the past few episodes, the Dene have truly established themselves as a premier power of North America. They have utterly crippled an already weakened Mississippi, a former frontrunner, and have had a vicious nuclear exchange with Rio Grande, taking multiple cities and containing a major rival, and would’ve probably pushed further if it weren’t for the Riograndese defense bug, which is also the only reason why Rio Grande is still ranked above Dene, if you ask me. They’re fighting the newly formed North-Yuan domains in Cascadia, and would’ve crushed them if it weren’t for all the peacekeepers and mountains. If they put their mind to it and if the Uzbeks got out, they could probably steal all of Chukchi’s inland Alaskan cities.

They expanded very little beyond their original homeland and were boxed in by stronger neighbours. Nevertheless, in the early days of the Royale, I remember them managing to repel a Punjabi invasion, despite being probably outnumbered and certainly outteched. They contended with Chola for Bengal for a while, until eventually, inevitably, losing that contest. Their northern ambitions were taken away due to Taiping and Uzbek conquests. However, they managed to keep in the mountains, and the stout, several-episodes-long resistance of Trashigang, while one of the generally-considered more boring episodes of the royale, did inspire one of its greatest narrative memes. It wasn’t until Punjab once again came for them, this time with a more decisive tech edge, that Bhutan was finally brought to its knees. Thanks to Northern Yuan’s peacekeepers, the Bhutanese were able to weather the Punjabi storm, but then Chola came in and took what was left. Although some, including one of the Power Rankers may call me crazy for it, I actually did legit find Bhutan to be endearing. Perhaps not Tibet-levels-of-endearing, but still.

    narration: "<p>Here we see that PARG has gained Tsetserleg as part of the peace deal. </p><p></p><p>Overall, I’d call this war a pyrrhic victory for Mandukhai, as, despite both sides gaining 2 cities each from each-other, Mandukhai has retaken her capital from Kolchak, and, as we all know, the CBR is a game of capitals. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we have a shot of the Chukchi core. Our frosty friends rule the seas in these region, but on land it’s a different tale - most of the land here is occupied by various foreign vacationers - Uzbeks, Kulins and Georgians, as well as a single Kurd - and exiles, namely the Neutral warrior on that Alaskan island. </p>"
