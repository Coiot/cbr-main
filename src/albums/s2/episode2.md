The Japanese sailors said that they had found land to the East, and the Chukchi laughed, because they had already found that land and called it Alyaska. The Japanese sailors also said that their dear leader Kaku-san had decided that they would settle another city on the continent, across from Karafuto island.

In the hills around Jerusalem it became evident that taking the city would be no simple feat, for the defenders had an army just as large and well prepared as the attackers, and Sharif Hussein wished that he only had friends from afar to guide his armies through the gates of Jerusalem.</p>"

In Nemossos the garrison laughed at how pitiful the German armies sent to invade had been, and though some still menaced Gergovia, they could not possibly take the city. So emboldened were the Gauls by the weakness of their foe that they had decided that now that Kaiser Wilhelm II had sent his armies to die against bold Gallic defenders, it was time to settle more lands to the east. With a small retinue and supported by patrolling scouts the settlers found no enemies, no resistance in the dense Teutoburg Forests.

News from Banfora was even more alarming, with refugees streaming into Ouagadougou, the city reportedly half burnt to the ground.

Though his war was going well, King Baldwin III was made nervous by the reported movements of Kurdish troops in the lands around Acre, so nervous that he dedicated half his armies to fortifying the city’s defenses.

His generals wondered why they were being kept in the capital, far from the front and commanding the Lesothan defence.</p>"
