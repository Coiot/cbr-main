  narration: "<p>Welcome back for the third and final part of Episode 20 of Season 2 of the Civ Battle Royale X. I'm not BloodyAltima! This is Bulletproof_Cookie ready to narrate the next 50 slides.</p><p></p><p>Yes, 50 slides. If it has not already become apparent already, the game has started to slow to a crawl due to the advanced state of the game. A big reason behind this is unit overflow causing newly built units to spawn on random unoccupied titles on the cylinder resulting in wars reaching to a stalemate where troops can't move around, advance into enemy territory or take cities. As such, the next 200 turns have been condensed down to the aforementioned number of slides. Otherwise, we would have 30-40 slides of nothing of interest happening and trust me, you don't want that. This was a big reason why Episode 20 was supposed to be an overview of 400 turns, but it turned out there was enough to warrant splitting the episode into multiple parts.</p><p></p><p>ALL THAT SAID, that doesn't mean there aren't some noteworthy incidents going on, so let's get on with it!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Part 2 ended on a cliffhanger teasing the birth of the newest chapter in the Punjab/Chola rivalry. Part 3 commences with a battle line drawn in the Indian subcontinent where Raja Raja hopes to defend his frontline cities (Pazhaiyarai, Thirunelveu, Kanchipuram and Katharagama) from being captured. The situation is currently a bit more serious than in his southeast asian lands with Punjabi land units (supported by a seemingly superior airforce) trying to break through.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A few brave Cholan XCOM units have attempted to infiltrate Yanbu and Thiruvarur but it's clearly a bad move as they'll get flicked off the cylinder within a moment's notice. Zaire's Middle Eastern holdings have no units supporting it, which could be disastrous should Uzbekistan declare war right this instant.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A sole Advanced Destroyer remains from the destruction of the Mapuche last part. It was a ruthless move by William Barak to overwhelm and completely conquer Lautaro's empire, and one that has won the hearts of all but one fickle Power Ranker. Adjacent is more than a dozen Northern Yuan embarked units wishing to enter the borders of one of the two remaining South American powers. Among them is a Paraguayan admiral, lucky to see the demise of one of his homeland's neighbours.</p>"

He cared little about the failed proposed ban on Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Unit Overflow is stopping either of the German or Sicilians from making any progress against one another.

I don't know why the Soviets, Sweden or any of the other European powers haven't expanded there yet. Maybe those Uzbek settlers next to Sundvall will be the ones to finally do so.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Blue Cassette would like to apologise about the accidental exclusion of Finland in this game. They were supposed to be the region civ there, but the team overlooked their inclusion for whatever reason (possibly due to the pressure of setting up and balancing everything and all the testing/recording that had to be done) and they only noticed the error hundreds of turns into recording.

Well, the ones killed by the blasts and radiation poisoning, at least.

If he had played his cards right, Kristjan could have expanded further into North America or claimed the entirety of the British Isles. The opportunity to replicate his predecessor's success and become a major player was wasted with the unsuccessful conquests of New Netherlands and the Neutral Nation. They eventually got kicked out of North America by Mississippi and the Vandals and the British Isles by Germany. From there, the withering Icelandic empire stagnated to the point where they were unable to progress any further scientifically. While most of the remaining world had embraced the technology of the future, Iceland was still figuring out the Industrial Revolution until they were at last put out of their misery.</p><p></p><p>The boat carrying Eldjarn and the musician eventually passed a group of icy mountains to reach an unfamiliar submarine.

All three parts combined were over 250 slides long! As mentioned at the beginning, very little happened these past 200 turns due to the advanced state of the game, but the two most notable events were Iceland's elimination and the ruining of Two Sicilies.</p><p></p><p>This has been Bulletproof_Cookie, and I wish you a good day.
