  narration: "<p>Goooood morning, evening or afternoon to you all! It’s u/GoatontheMountain, returning to narrate for the first time since the Inuit and Blackfoot battled for North America, Boers and Brazilians were terrifying and people took time to mock Armenia for…reasons. They were harmless and didn’t deserve to be hated. Four years ago pandemics were the stuff of science fiction for most of us, Civ VI was pretty new and we were all a little younger and less wise. </p><p>What hasn’t changed is war. Cylinder-wide, eternal, horrific war. Although, actually, that’s changed as well. For the better! Fewer peacekeepers around to muck things up, no Buccaneer fleets of carriers stretching for hundreds of miles, cool new mechanics. Those of you following your first CBR have no idea how much has been invested to improve this game. </p><p>So, whoever and wherever you are, raise a glass to the showrunners, get comfy, and enjoy episode 26 of CBR season 2!</p>"

  narration: "<p>If you are anything like me you have a permanent tab with the most recent map and toggle back and forth to it frequently while reading each episode. Mapmakers are the heroes we don’t deserve but desperately need, and Virheaa is the best of them. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Orangechrisy’s Malacca in the Middle continues to provide that sweet, sweet civball flavor we crave. Most of the other OC this fortnight revolved around campaigning for season 3 candidates and as I’ve not done enough research to confidently choose horses in that race I’ll stick with what I know. And what I know is that Mansur Shah is a madman. </p>"

  narration: "<p>For just the price of a single cup of coffee a month you could sponsor the death of tens of millions or fictitious innocents every two weeks. Won’t you give to make a difference in the lives of these poor souls, just begging for someone to finish the game so they can rest in peace? </p>"

  narration: "<p>We have a new leader! Will the Chukchi live up to their new reputation and push for further greatness? Will the Marajoara take their demotion as the kick in the pants they need to break out from South America? Answers lie a quick scroll away!</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin with a quick refresher on current governments and the loft titles they bestow upon their leaders.</p><p></p><p>P'kuee is the Mayoress of a Merchant League, which seems reasonable with no enemies but who the heck are the Marjoara trading with? There's no one within an ocean of them except for Rio Grande. </p><p></p><p>The Neutrals are run by their Healers. Could this be foreshadowing for bloodshed?</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a domination game it always helps to present yourself as powerful, imperious and threatening. To that end PARG is run by the elderly. Meanwhile, the Babylonians sit quietly around a campfire, no power aboard the sub but the word of Nebby. Arrogance rules in Germany and Chukchi. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Moeshoeshoe joined Kulin in assaulting Malacca last episode and now the cows are coming home to roost. Lesotho takes back Morija and the Malaccan offensive again seems to have died out. We've seen that story before, however, and Mansur Shah's ships always return...</p><p></p>"

  narration: "<p>Kulin reclaim Marpeang Balug to reunite the last Australian clay and land ground troops on Papua New Guinea to fight for Tsetserleg. Malacca is not terribly aggressive here. Several Kulin settlers lurk, perhaps eyeing all the land left empty by Shah's firefest last episode…</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile the Dene look to claim the latest one tile paradise on Vanuatu. Or maybe Fiji?</p>"

  scene_title: "Isthmus-Enforced Peace"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>All is quiet here, though some day war between Rio and the Marajoara will play a large role in deciding cylindrical dominance. For now neither has much in the way of terrestrial troops and their navies are separated by a canal-free Panama.</p>"

  scene_title: "North North America Versus South North America"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rio may have started this war but Thanadelthur looks to have marshalled more forces. The Neutrals are nearly removed from relevance with only Andrachkhrob left in the North American mainland. Ciudad Victoria has been an obvious target for the Dene in every war between these two as mountains block any easy reinforcement from the Rio core.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nukus is firmly held by PARG as melee troops march on Samarkand and Andijan. There's no reason this war should last much longer before ending in elimination or a cagey peace deal by Islam Karimov.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho is looking good with their new UU the Bull's Blood Warrior, a musketman replacement that gets a war charm, granting random combat bonuses (or not) to adjacency and/or fighting on hills. Nigeria has had their own UU, the Yan Lifid knight replacer. for a while and are starting to look outnumbered heavily to the south and the north, should the Vandals ever set sail for Onitsha and Lagos.</p>"

  scene_title: "First Blood, Part 2"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kotka has fallen to the Soviets, whose horseman beneath the puppet logo looks like a unicorn! Children in the fallen city are allowed to escape to a more fantastical world, if only for a moment, as retreating soldiers fasten wooden horns to their mounts’ heads to distract from the march of boots and booming impact of trebuchet rounds. </p><p></p><p>Helsinki dips to yellow while the Soviet southern beachhead is firmly established. Finns drop back to defend in the shadow of their city walls while the Soviet fleet angrily mills about and wonders why the German naval bias is so high.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marpeang and Nar Nar Goon end up back with their original owner while Tsetserleg is spared. Kulin looked to have made a grave mistake starting this war but has managed to end things on reasonably level terms. More importantly they seem to have learned their lesson and have a solid army in place in the north and ships that appear to be approaching the once and future front from around their small continent.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Irresistible Advance of Progress"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kotka flips back to blue but the USSR appears firmly committed to seeing this war through. The mountains, lack of naval access and distance to Porvoo mean Mannerheim has some time left but ultimately there's nothing he can do to stave off death if Lenin presses on. All those missionaries and prophets praying for salvation won't stop a balanced army of crossbows and longswords if they're protected by nothing but much shorter swords and recurve bows.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Andijan takes a bit of damage as muskets head south. Samarkand is nearly out of defenders as well. In celebration, Kolchak cuts the ribbon on a shiny new tomb for his deceased spouse, the Taj Mahal, kicking off a golden age and providing endless extra happiness as only a tomb can.</p>"

- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Civilian Defense Corps"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Kulin decides that naval babies don't deserve candy and sends a fleet to relieve the now mostly landlocked Punjab of their budding colony at Rawalpindi. A defensive force of...no one will not be sufficient to save it.</p>"

  scene_title: "Nowhere to Run"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene22.jpg

  scene_title: "Nowhere to Hide"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>And Helsinki falls, the hammer and sickle rising above the Finnish heartland. Turku, having convinced the crossbows to retreat out of range, is adjudged the best choice for a new capital. Don't worry, Porvoo, you'll get to wear the star in about six turns, give or take.</p>"

  scene_title: "Just Cleaning Up the Maps"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rawalpindi has fallen without fuss. Ranjit Singh should greet the news with equanimity, recognizing the likely futility of the venture, and place his next failsafe colony somewhere less threatened. Antarctica beckons…</p><p></p><p>Malacca now sports cannons as the leading science civs move into the Renaissance.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>I can't recall a Nigerian-Marajoaran war starting but it appears they are indeed settling some grudge, likely the founding of Benn City. War canoes are no longer peak technology but they should be plenty for this conquest. P'kuee should consider this practice for future adventures up north.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Helsinki, Kotka and Viipuri all fly the red and yellow, though the latter two may flip once more before succumbing permanently. Civilian units continue to mask just how small Finland's remaining defensive force is.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Ashes to Ashes"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mokhotolong is reduced to ash as the Kulin peace allows the full might of the blue and gold jong fleet to sweep west. Morija and Qacha's Nek have barely recovered from the last round of conquests and now face an existential threat of razing.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Mannerheim Goes to Live on a Farm with Grandpa. He’s Totally Still Alive, Believe Me!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mannerheim begs a desperate peace from Lenin, sacrificing Porvoo and any hope of ever seeing the sea again to retire in relative peace to the hills of Turku. Leaving the coast halves their danger as Germany no longer presents a significant threat of elimination. Finland will live on as the Tibet to the Soviet's Vietnam.</p>"

  scene_title: "Graveyard. Of. Empires. Or At Least Graveyard Adjacent."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Andijan falls to red as the PARGish muskets do their job. Still, this is far from an efficient conquest and, paired with the failure to make headway against a distracted Northern Yuan last episode, does not look good for the future good war fighting of this All-Russian AI.</p><p></p><p>Prizreni dips to yellow and Mandukhai's horcrux in Georgia is in trouble.</p>"

  scene_title: "Push and Pull"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>We haven't seen much of this war despite the potent competitors. At last troops are moving into position, with asymmetric advances promising changes for our mapmakers. Thanadelthur wants Ciudad Victoria while Rosillo sends a massive army into Ontario and Manitoba. If the Dene don't scramble a defense quickly they stand to lose the better cities. Fortunately for them Rio is leading knights and shouldn't threaten Deline or Dettah until those cannons can creep into position.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Benn City is absorbed into the Marajoaran empire, forming an unpleasantly similarly-shaded border with the Vandal outposts to the southeast. Will these two empires rekindle old hostilities, remembering their time battling over the Caribbean in the previous cycle? Ilorin could certainly fall to P'kuee as well.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The jongs focus on swarming into a pincer formation but the direct attacks will come soon. Lesotho's navy is modernizing but faces a major numerical imbalance.</p><p></p><p>Looking for a PR win, Lesotho declares war on Punjab, a gesture that could be meaningful if peace can be made with the Malaccan menace.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ciudad Victoria quickly drops to yellow while Dene ships scout for potential conquests in Topo de los Ayala and San Nicolas de los Garza. Rio focuses on their own goals but the Dene have pumped out a lot of new troops in the last two turns. It won't help Rosillo that most of his cannons have decided to garrison Michigan, defending the Great Lakes, where no ships can be built.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Rage With No Outlet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nemossos burns and Vercingetorix appears content to hide his forces in England and Wales, all but abandoning Bibracte and its 48 million residents. If the five pop in Nemossos was too much for Vandalic happiness to bear I think we can safely assume a lot of rebels will start showing up in northern Africa if the un-torchable Gaul capital falls.</p>"

  scene_title: "Cranking Up the Difficulty"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>PARG continues to utterly fail at taking the helpless final Uzbek cities and decide maybe what they need is more of a challenge. To that end they declare a second war on Punjab, whose forces immediately flood in to defend Karimov's land. Ideally Ranjit would hold back slightly so that PARG would take them, absorb the big diplomatic hit, and then claim them for himself.</p><p></p><p>Punjab comes in riding the high of completing Versailles, a culture wonder from Pouakai's Enlightenment mod.</p>"

  scene_title: "Why Choose One Target When You Can Choose Three?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca nab another Enlightenment mod, Torre del Oro, providing a very nice bonus to naval trade route range and gold along with some great merchant points.</p><p></p><p>Rather than trade with Lesotho's ports they surge forward to claim them with gunpowder. The approach is scattered and inefficient at the moment. Is this a creative feint to spread the defenders out or a case of Civ AI biting off more than it can chew? Time will tell.</p>"

  scene_title: "Samar-kind of a Jerk Move"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The PARG war machine did indeed find inspiration from actual defenders to take Samarkand. Just as Ranjit Singh planned, as he immediately repurposes it for himself. Punjabi troops line up south of Andijan, begging Kolchak's muskets to grab glory by eliminating the Uzbeks once and for all, knowing the victory would last precisely as long as the time it takes to process the civs between them in turn order.</p>"

  scene_title: "Peacekeepers on a Mysterious Mission"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>The last war seems to have broken Northern Yuan's spirits as their core is nearly empty of troops. Perhaps that will change with gunpowder unlocking their lancer replacement UU.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime Chukchi are doing a great job of filling the void. If they're heading for the PARG core Omsk itself could be threatened!</p>"

  scene_title: "Still Avoiding the Real Fight"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Rosillo moves his cannons across Lake Michigan and into a much more sensible position to threaten Deline as his army pushes back the Dene defenders. The odds of taking the city are looking good. Ciudad Victoria should fall shortly. Where Thanadelthur's fleet goes next could decide how Dene supporters feel about this war after its end.</p>"

  scene_title: "This Ocean is Mine and Mine Alone!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca's strategy appears to have been actual genius as Qacha's Nek is secured, Morija will turn blue next turn, and they'll even have another chance to burn Mokhotlong (or not) very soon. There's every chance that the fleet could swoop in and take Quthing as well, really starting to solidify Malaccan hegemony over the Indian Ocean.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>C. V. falls and will not flip back to Rio any time soon. To the north, Rosillo's army is suddenly less Rio Grande and more Rio Mediano as the cannons continue to meander instead of shoot and knights fruitlessly patrol the outskirts of Deline.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Same Story, Different Blue"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca's advance continues exactly as expected with steady progress across the front. Moeshoeshoe can't keep up with ship production and may be better off focusing on a solid defense of his core rather than sending ships out to be slaughtered as fast as they can be commissioned in the name of slightly slowing the invasion.</p>"

  scene_title: "Getting Involved in a Land War in Asia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene44.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another war for the All-Russians, and for once they aren't the ones declaring it! Lenin, bored after his Scandinavian evisceration ended without a complete kill, looks to the east for fresh clay. As always the Urals will make progress difficult but the sweet plains between Kharkov and Samara promise bloodshed. Despite the difficult geography a border this long was always going to spark conflict. Large armies, similar tech and a lot of chokepoints could make progress slow but Lenin's strategic game has been vastly better than Kolchak's so far. Soviet brilliance may yet carry the day.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene45.jpg
  narration: "<p>I stand corrected! Ciudad Victoria has flipped back, though it remains critically endangered. Still, all respect to the knights who dared rush back into the teeth of the Dene advance. To the west ships head for Rosillo's resort islands though I'm not sure they'll be enough, especially as they look to be splitting between two targets. Should they succeed I would be very concerned for the local populace with two settlers accompanying the fleet in prime position to reestablish cities after the current residents are put to the flame.</p><p></p><p>The Dene also look poised to attempt a reconquista of their long-lost city of Echaot'l Koe.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene47.jpg
  narration: "<p>A peek in at western Africa, where troops are scarce but ships are plentiful. A quick build up and rush could be hugely profitable for Lesotho against Nigeria, but also for either Nigeria or the Vandals along their land border.</p>"

  scene_title: "Happiness!!!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>The people have spoken and life is just better in a city state. Once the pressure of winning the whole shebang is lifted people can just relax and appreciate the little things in life. Choosing your next building is an event, not a chore to be done twelve times per turn, Each new unit is handcrafted with love. Farms are precious. New citizens are not just welcomed but known by name. Truly, we should all aspire to live in the moment the way the humble Lawspeakers Karimove, Mannerheim and Sese Seko do.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene49.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not to say that the great powers are universally depressed! No, there is some joy in the world. Though Malacca's murderous mayor apparently can't blame the repeated Mokhotolongian genocide on discontent as his empire is still narrowly but firmly supportive of his rule. Perhaps it's the Malaccan people who have a grudge and this score is actually the result of the merchant republic's joy at the ongoing murders?</p>"

  narration: "<p>And the bottom of the list. The Germans and Vandals, despite a lack of wars or recent conquest, Iberia notwithstanding, are frustrated with their lot. These are two of this cycle's most expansive cultures and it may be time to focus any future settlements on places where novel luxuries might be found.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Samarkand is back in white and looks to stay that way. Andijan is perma-blacked and overjoyed about it. To the north Chukchi forces creep into All-Russian territory. Are they headed to try for an overland invasion of the USSR? Germany!? No one knows. Soviet and Pargish forces clash with no sign of initial advantage to either side.</p><p></p><p>With Mauritius cleansed once more Mansur Shah makes peace with Moeshoeshoe. No cities seem to have been included on the minimap. Punjab recognizes the futility of trying to get through the mountains to Xilinhot and calls a truce with N. Yuan.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mandukhai's southern territory is well-protected by her forces and the north is thoroughly defended by Lawtiliwadlin. Malacca's cities are defended by faith and the reputation of its jong fleet, almost daring either Punjab or Chukchi to take the bait here and suffer disproportionately on the seas.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode26-scene53.jpg
  narration: "<p>The aftermath of Lesotho's poorly planned war with Malacca confirms what the minimap told us. Shah has two new colonies but Moeshoeshoe kept the more valuable cities on Madagascar and can always settle the city that shall not be named once more.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, where are all those Kulin ships going? Oh yeah, they declared war on Punjab...twelve turns ago! This map isn't so large and conquests that seemed impossible in the first cycle are suddenly feasible with a little patience and a lot of nerve.</p>"
