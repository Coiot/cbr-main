  narration: "<p>Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet’s get ready to rumbleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Howdy folks, it’s me, ItsTruckMonth, back for another narration. I assume some of y’all remember me from my introduction last part but here's a small recap: been around since X1, resident shitposter, yada-yada and all that. It’s been a small bit since I last narrated, and I’m glad I can come back for yet another narration for (in my opinion) the most exciting season yet!</p><p></p><p>Alright enough of that introduction stuff. Let’s get down to yet another episode of the Civ Battle Royale: X2 (Cycle 2)!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our second bit of OC this week is yet another map, but a bit more underground, as u/E_C_H has done a phenomenal job composing <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1vuGC8u1-zw7Hy0UPcRE6OaNXsYNvaRkL&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C0&z=1'>a map of the burial sites of every single leader present in the CBR series</a> (including the upcoming X3!).

  narration: "<p>Before we get into the actual good stuff let’s check in on everyone’s favorite subject: Politics!</p><p></p><p>Just kidding, though, we can see some new governments forming, such as the Vandal Monastic Order, the Neutral Military Dictatorship, and the Marajoara Horde. Don’t know how horses fare in the Amazon rainforest, P’kuee, but hey you do you I guess.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hordin’ Hordes"

  narration: "<p>Our last look at governments shows us some other government changes, including the Principality of Gaul, the Dene joining the Neutrals in being war-hawkish psychos, and the PARG-champs hopping on the horde bandwagon, in a region that probably is gonna see more success for hordes, but who am I to judge. </p><p></p><p>And with that out of the way, let’s get into the good stuff!</p>"

  scene_title: "No Admirals?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our first shot this part takes us to the Vandal-Nigerian front, showing Aba still in Vandal hands. Two Nigerian galleons stand next to the island ready to take it, only for the Vandal naval force to retake it almost instantly. The larger Nigerian fleet to the right could really be of some use right now, that Kulin fleet really doesn’t need that many ships, you know.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of fleets, uh remember last episode when Nigeria had that ridiculous amount of Great Admirals? Yeah uh, where did they go, Awolowo? Did you, in your infinite wisdom, make admirals out of people who never learned to swim? Awolowo??</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sign 1: A large military build up on your borders that definitely isn’t there for peaceful purposes.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lesotho goes back into the ring against Nigeria, the latter of which has quite the undefended southern flank. Lubumbashi, Mbuji-Mayi, and Kananga look like ripe pickings for the more advanced Lesotho land force. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Here’s a shot of the Vandal naval core in the Mediterranean. Apparently Genseric read of a long lost civilization from another time, one that looped this grand sea and was the center of the world at the time. Genseric had recreated this, but his ambitions are greater. He wants to rise higher than that great empire: not just become the center of the world, but the world itself.</p><p></p><p>Also btw, they’re still at war with the Gauls. If you couldn’t tell I don’t blame you, I couldn’t tell at first either.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We get a good shot of Punjab, who’s not in the best spot overall at the moment. To the north lies the Himalayas and the accursed J̸͉̠̌̔͋͝͝ǫ̷͌͠n̶͇̭̼̮̓͌g̸͎̬͐́. And finally to the west lies PARG, our #1, the Chukchi. To the south lies Malacca, the wielder of probably their best choice for expansion, but still a tough nut to crack.</p><p></p><p>They’re ways away from their place at #1 earlier this season, and their chance to win it all may have slipped away a long time ago.</p>"

  narration: "<p>To the southwest, we see the accursed J̸͉̠̌̔͋͝͝ǫ̷͌͠n̶͇̭̼̮̓͌g̸͎̬͐́ in all their glory. The menace of Southeast Asia, and the bane of Kulin’s existence, Malacca still stands as one of the top contenders of the game, and anyone with turf in the Pacific or Indian oceans should be wary of this seaward monster.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Prisoner"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>And to the southeast-southeast, lies the Kulin. A continent all to themselves, but is it a blessing, or a curse? They’ve warred numerous times with their rival to the North, and as a result have been contained to the land down under. Is there a possibility for them to break out of this shell? Only time will tell.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Sleeping Giant"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>We get a shot of the sleeping giant of South America, the Marajoara, who as of last part have been sleeping no longer. A war with both the Vandals and Big River have left them slightly bruised, but nowhere near out of the competition. Will this be enough to awaken them from their science-maxxing slumber? Again, only time will tell.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Alright enough boring lore stuff, it’s time for war again!</p><p></p><p>Chukchi, still somehow unsatisfied with pummeling Nyuan into non-existence, now set their sights on their former wartime ally, PARG. This doesn’t seem like it’ll be as much of a freebie however, Kolchak’s forces are somewhat on par with the Chukchi, so be prepared for another grindfest in Central Siberia.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Alright and we’re now back to peace. This time the Vandals and Nigeria have made peace, with no cities given away in peace deals I believe. Overall, it was a win for the Vandals, taking all of Nigeria’s Atlantic island cities (you’ll see later) and Port Harcourt, giving Vandals universal control of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p></p><p>Also yes, Gauls are still at war with the Vandals.</p>"
- scene_number: 18

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not much to see on this slide from the Kulin core, so let’s take a look at the wonders built on the side.</p><p></p><p>Nigeria builds Broadway, which grants a free Great Musician and 3 Great Works of Music slots. Overall not really beneficial when the prime objective is conquest, but hey at least they’re conquering while listening to a certified banger.</p><p>Meanwhile Lesotho builds Fasil Ghebbi, which gives a +33% combat bonus to friendly units within 2 tiles of the city it’s built in. No clue where it was built, but whoever tries to take that city could be in for a hell of a fight.</p>"

  scene_title: "Wondermaxxing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>And speaking of wonders, let’s take a look at who is building the most. Mansur takes the lead at 13 wonders, followed by Awolowo at 11. Singh takes 3rd with 8 wonders, while Barak and Lawtiliwadlin tie at 4th with 5. Rosillo and P’kuee tie at 5th with 4 wonders, and Moshoeshoe takes 6th with 2.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Russias go to war as Lenin joins in the fight against Kolchak. While PARG’s east flank is quite lightly defended by units, the Ural mountains will make the Soviet’s movements painfully slow. </p><p></p><p>That said, Lenin’s funneling a massive amount of units between the Urals and the Caspian Sea towards a lightly defended Samara. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Lesotho’s making good progress in the war against Nigeria, taking Mbuji-Mayi down to the red. Things are gonna get worse from here though, as Nigerian forces are streaming down thanks to the peace deal with the Vandals. Mbuji may be the subject of one heavy flip fest. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Lubumbashi has yet to take any damage, but Lesotho troops continue to surround the city.</p>"

  scene_title: "NA’s Big Bois"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>We get a shot of the cores and border between the Dene and Big River, the titans of North America. Last part saw another war between them, with Ciudad Victoria becoming Dene clay. Now, Rosillo arguably has the advantage in terms of land tech, but Thanadelthur holds the naval and geographic advantage.</p><p></p><p>Imo, the only way Big River can break the Dene is jumping them should they get into a war with the Chukchi.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hothot Conflict"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>The first spoil of the Siberian war is Hothot, taken by the Chukchi, and it looks to be slightly secured in Chukchi’s hands even with the PARG units nearby. The geography and density of PARG troops will make the other city captures much more challenging, however.</p>"

  scene_title: "Damming the River (but from about 2 miles away)"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another coalition begins, with the new target being the Big River Bois. Lesotho and PARG are certainly irrelevant here, though Kulin’s involvement could mean bad business for Rio’s singular Polynesian city.</p><p></p><p>Already skirmishes between River Boi and Kulin ships can be seen just off the coast of Mexico. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Soviets push towards Krasnodar and bring it to the red, with multiple melee units ready to take the city.</p><p></p><p>Kolchak it’s cool that you have one of the most advanced navies in the world, but there’s kinda no point if you don’t actually use the damn navy.</p>"

  scene_title: "Yes, but May-I Have it Back?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene29.jpg

  narration: "<p>The Chukchi advance on Shangdu and Zalantun is, as expected, quite a meat grinder. Meanwhile, PARG curaissers and pikemen press towards the late Kosovan exclave of Gjilani, and begin to slightly damage it.</p><p></p><p>Also in the sidebar, Kulin and Nigeria make peace, if that was ever really relevant (yes I saw the couple Kulin ships in Nigerian waters earlier quiet you).</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Soviets take Krasnodar with little movement by PARG’s cruiser fleet. Meanwhile a trio of curaissers press through the mountains towards Ufa, but without any siege weapons and a combat penalty against cities, don’t expect the Soviets to make much progress here.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh yeah, the war between the Vandals and Gauls.</p><p></p><p>Wait, things are actually happening? Two Vandal SotL (Ship-of-the-Lines) are attacking Gergovia, and a breakaway fleet is moving towards Gaelic Scotland. If he can’t break the capital, Genseric may have to break the rest of Vercingetorix’s frail and lackluster empire. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Lesotho retakes Mbuji-Mayi in the city’s third flip (also no I’m not making any more Mayi puns). However, Lesotho’s starting to finally make progress on other fronts, as the city of Lubumbashi is now down to the yellow, and is likely to fall soon.</p><p></p><p>The rough terrain will make that city hard to retake for Nigeria, however.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Now Watch this Drive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Multiple other nations declare war on PARG in an effort to contain the White Menace. Punjab easily is the biggest foe in this wave of declarations, looking to steal Nukus, Voronezh and possibly even the late Uzbek capital of Tashkent.</p><p></p><p>The terrain should definitely be their biggest obstacle, given a somewhat lackluster defense force. To surpass that could spell hope for Punjab breaking out of their Ganges Basin prison. </p>"

  scene_title: "Deserting Desert"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lubumbashi expectedly fell to Lesotho forces, and the geography favors Lesotho, making it hard for Nigeria to retake the city. Nigeria’s forces here are looking worse for wear: their land force outside Mbuji-Mayi has dwindled to two melee units, and their navy on both sides has been decimated. Overall, things look sour for our former number one.</p>"

  scene_title: "Live Landlubber Reaction"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Down south, we can see proof of the Vandals island hopping conquests, taking their Antarctic holdings and the city of Aba, confining Nigeria to the African mainland (and like half of Arabia). These islands could become a nice forward base for another campaign against Marajoara.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Marajoara, they’ve awoken and have declared war on Nigeria, which could be more relevant than one would initially think.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Chukchi and PARG make peace, with Hothot being the only prize by the Winter Warriors. Already PARG takes advantage of this newfound peace, and shifts the majority of his force towards the Urals, to face the Soviet threat head-on.</p><p>Also the Gauls join in on the fun, but they have bigger problems than PARG.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode28-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vandal breakaway force has found its way to Vienna, and has already brought it down to half health. Gaelic naval units do exist, but are sorely behind in terms of tech and will almost certainly be annihilated by Vandal cruisers and SotL’s.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, a pair of Vandal cruisers head towards Gaelic Newfoundland. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Nigeria retakes Mbuji-Mayi yet again, but this time it looks a lot more secure than before. Lubumbashi stays practically impenetrable, another Nigerian frigate heads towards Hlotse, and Lesotho units snake their way into the Nigerian core, possibly targeting Abuja.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The accursed J̸͉̠̌̔͋͝͝ǫ̷͌͠n̶͇̭̼̮̓͌g̸͎̬͐́ sets its sights on Africa, and declares war on Lesotho. Despite an impressive land army, their navy is laughably behind as of now, and seeing what the J̸͉̠̌̔͋͝͝ǫ̷͌͠n̶͇̭̼̮̓͌g̸͎̬͐́ can do against navies of frigates, the Lesotho galleases are going to get absolutely washed over.</p><p></p><p>I can already see Madagascar slowly turning blue as we speak.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The war between Punjab and PARG is expectedly going nowhere so let’s take a look at Punjab’s UU.</p><p></p><p>The Akali replaces the rifleman, and grants the traditional melee unit a short Ranged attack. It also is cheaper to purchase with faith, and gets a free promotion if trained in a Holy City. Given Punjab’s religious fervor, these units are (hopefully) going to be a game-changer in this conflict.</p>"
