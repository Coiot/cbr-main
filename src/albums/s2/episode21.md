  scene_title: "Welcome to Hell"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene01.jpg
  narration: "<p>Good evening, and welcome to a most solemn occasion. The final episode of the first cycle, and thus, the commencement of total war. After the events of this episode, all the surviving nations will resume their machinations on a smaller, tighter cylinder, starting from their final capitals and receiving various bonuses corresponding to their success in this cycle.</p><p></p><p>For those of you who were here for the last season, things will play out a bit different this time. While total war is declared on Turn 1155, it isn’t perpetuated. In other words, if two civs decide to make peace to focus on their real enemies, they are not forced back into war. After this we’re going to Cycle 2 (AKA Endgame), so this is less about getting absolute winners and losers and more about clearing out the chaff. If you’re worried this means the episode will be uneventful, don’t be: this episode is a riot, and things will never again be the same.</p><p></p><p>Let’s not beat around the bush: this episode is 200 slides long, and we have a lot to get through both on and off-screen. So I’m not going to spend too long on each slide - I’ll be giving you the need-to-know facts and a little analysis. Welcome to the fabled Final Episode of the First Cycle.</p>"

  scene_title: "Vihreaa Slaps"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene02.jpg
  narration: "<p>Our map comes as ever from the wonderful Vihreaa. Look how many cities there are - it’s credit to the showrunners that the game is still running relatively smoothly even at this stage of the saga. One thing we missed in the episode but sort of visible here was the death of the poor Yuan, who had done an excellent job at staving off certain annihilation for centuries, but finally fell to a Kulin expeditionary force. The biggest change to the map since last time was the fall of Two Sicilies, reduced to only four cities and surely soon to lose even those.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene03.jpg
  narration: "<p>/u/veryice portrays a pain we all know too well - the knowledge that your unproblematic favs will only last as long as the world’s at peace, and it won’t be at peace much longer. But will either of these two microstates beat the odds and endure the coming storm?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr20-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>They may not be the true focus of this episode, as the Cylinder’s serious powers jostle for supremacy. But 21 is Finland’s highest ever ranking. For them, this is the big time. Can they keep that forward momentum when all around them descends into mayhem? It’s unlikely, but then, Finland sticking around to Episode 21 wasn’t hugely likely either.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Before we get to the excitement, we have about 50 turns to breeze through first. Don’t worry, it won’t take long.</p><p></p><p>Kosovo declares war on Kurdistan, who have one city and 119 citizens. I can’t really see any way through that enormous chain of citadels running from Tbilisi to Sine, so Barzani should be fine for the time being. Kosovo’s territory is littered with Northern Yuanic helicopters; when total war comes I’d expect those to be obliterated immediately, so Rugova could certainly have picked a worse civ to share open borders with.</p>"

  scene_title: "Picking On Someone Your Own Size"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Laos joins Kosovo in the war of the city states and unbelievably they’re the ones who are actually threatening the city, with two lost Laotian War Elephants suddenly finding themselves on the front line. In any normal, self-respecting universe this would be nothing more than a silly diversion… but Qamislo is already at near 0 HP from constant bombing raids. They couldn’t… could they?</p>"

  scene_title: "Making War Look Zamb-easy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Of course Qamislo is only one front of this continent-spanning war, as Fa Ngum also brings the battle to, er, southeast Africa. But despite being more in their natural habitat, I think the elephants here in the savannah will be less lucky than their compatriots in the Middle East. They’re up against Kurdish tanks. It won’t be long until the Zambezi will be running red with pachyderm parts.</p>"

  scene_title: "At Least We’re Prospering"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>We hit a golden age: likely the last of many for this cycle. In the background, Lesotho and Zaire both certainly host peacekeepers, but their lands are a lot less densely packed than most of the Cylinder. This should make it a much more open and intriguing area of conflict in, say, forty turns time.</p>"

  scene_title: "Shades of Hannibal"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Heavens, Laos have brought back-up! They sure are serious about this little endeavour. That said, with the South Caspian swamped full of embarked Nigerians, I’m not sure they’ll have much of a through line down south to… hang on… those colours… </p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Kurdistan Do Not Exist"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>In one fell swoop, we lose two members of the one-city club. Kurdistan is eliminated in 26th place. And unbelievably, it’s Laos that deals the final blow, putting them on a whopping two cities… for the amount of time it takes them to raze Qamislo, at most. Well, it’s not like they were going to hold it for very long, but it’s still a disappointing lack of ambition. This could have been your way back into the game, Fa!</p><p></p><p>Kurdistan is a tricky civ to eulogise. I was really supporting them going into the game, and they disappointed me at every step, founding only a handful of cities and butchering every attempted invasion they tried, even against fellow no-hopers like Jerusalem. They had the very occasional diversion against civs like Punjab and Hejaz, but ultimately it was their war with a surging Zaire that proved their doom… eventually, as it has to have been one of the slowest and most boring invasions we’ve ever seen in a CBR. Fitting, really, for a civ who frustrated the power rankers to the extent that, week-in week-out, we merely informed you that they continued to exist. Well, now they don’t.</p>"

  scene_title: "2x2 Sicilies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>A couple of turns later Rugova realises there’s nothing left to attack any more and makes peace with the deceased Kurds. In the meantime we see the Federated States of the Two Sicilies. I think last episode said they controlled three cities - there is a fourth, as somehow they clung on to Jerusalem. It’s incredibly hard to see how they’ll hold on ‘til the next cycle: it almost looks like Nigeria’s gearing up for an invasion already.</p>"

  scene_title: "How Does One Be “Aliha” Anyway"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Confirming what I said earlier, poor old Yuan was eliminated off-screen last episode. You’ll note Kulin actually managed to reclaim the tile Hetu Ala is located on from the Chukchi, too. While distant outposts can be useful jumping-off points, I’m not sure Barak’ll be able to do much with this paltry colony. I’d expect this to be among the first cities to fall in total war, with hyper-advanced Chukchi units already standing by. Speaking of which: Lawtiliwadlin, annex your cities! You’ve had Japan for ages now, it’s time to build some courthouses!</p><p></p><p>Taiping declares war on Laos. Gee, I sure hope that’s not an omen for something more life-threatening. Like, say… </p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Back to Square One"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Punjab declares war against Laos, which probably heralds a much faster re-entry to the one city club than they’d maybe anticipated. Well, I say that, but the two civs only barely border each other, and some handy Chukchi peacekeepers are currently occupying the little stretch of the Mekong separating the two belligerents. Still, the bombing raids have brought the city to the deep black already, so it’ll only take one unit. It could be a case of when, not if.</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Elephants Everywhere"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Fa Ngum has been eager to enlist more war elephants, given how successful they proved in the Conquest of the Kurds. Unfortunately the only war elephant training academy is in Sukhumi, and most of them haven’t managed to find a way home yet. Let’s face it, they’re safer up here.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Fiery Proceedings"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sai Gon must have flipped, because the Laotian ministers have relocated to Qamislo (the minimap shows Sai Gon in Laotian hands though). But I imagine it’s pretty hard to hold council meetings and hearings when, er, everything around you is on fire. That’s right, despite relocating their capital to their new Kurdish colony, they’re still completely locked into razing it. And guess what? That’s true even if Sai Gon falls for good. Laos could be about to set an incredible record: the only CBR civ to actually eliminate itself. I am speechless.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Sai Gone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Sai Gon now flies Punjabi colours once more; this time, Laos won’t retake it. Fa Ngum once again joins the one city club… for as long as it takes for him to destroy his last city. This has to be the single most ignoble way to go in CBR history, watching as your own armies destroy your legacy. Unless he can make it to Total War and have the slightly less embarrassing exit of being taken out by whichever civ sneezes on him first.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Marajoarpet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Marajoara will go into total war with one huge advantage: they’re one of the few civs to not be completely overrun with a hodgepodge of foreign XComs. Indeed, their units are even encroaching into Kulin-held Caracas, though kept away from the city proper by some Rio Grande divisions. The Marajoara may well go into the next Cycle with the best position of any contender - after all, as it stands theirs is the only capital on the whole of South America. But they’ll have to avoid being sandwiched by Rio Grande and Kulin in the wars to come.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Infinncible"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, the Finns. You want a fun Finnish fact? Finland has neither gained nor lost a city this entire game. Not a single war they’ve fought has resulted in a city flip. That’s insane, and surely won’t last into total war - especially if that huge Kulin contingent to the north sticks around. The Soviets on the other hand aren’t committing any troops up here (I mean, why would they?) while Uzbekistan’s forces here are probably less impressive than Finland’s, or at least less advanced. Karimov has built a huge chain of citadels up to Helsinki though, enlisting the Nigerians to defend it. Remember when Helsinki was the largest city on the Cylinder, dwarfing the other villages at a mighty 40 population?</p>"

  scene_title: "The Atlantic Garbage Patch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>The world’s a terrifying place for stateless pirates on their last legs. But the remainder of Iceland’s privateer fleet should be safe for now in this patch of the Atlantic, surrounded by embarked Marajoara units. You should think these units will be torn apart by the nearby advanced Vandalic armada - hey, even Gaul might do a number on them. That poor embarked Mississippian infantry won’t last too long either. Total war is total hell.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "It’s Qaming..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The final Laotian city keeps burning. If left to its own devices, Laos would absolutely burn themselves off the map. But that would take another 22 turns, and we don’t have that long. The time approaches, and I’m not sure Laos will hold out long enough to see their crazy plan through. Nigeria seems most primed to take them out, though it’s hard to see them clinging on to the outpost much longer than a turn or two, with both Zaire and Uzbekistan ready to move in. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Still one slide to go...</p>"

  scene_title: "Thank You Pliny, Now Get Out of the Way"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>And it’s just a recap on the best tourist destinations on the Cylinder. I’m guessing there won’t be too many international tourists in a couple of years. A lot of international travellers, though.</p><p></p><p>Right, that’s quite enough of the preamble. Let’s get to the main event. The Cylinder enters total war. Strap in.</p>"

  scene_title: "Gerusalemme in Italian"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The first thing to point out is we’re going to be a bit more zoomed-in than usual for these fateful turns. The game simply wouldn’t run otherwise. Still, it’ll give us some pretty impressive shots, as you’ll soon see… For now, I’m enjoying the war elephant model from the local Laotians. Clearly we’re yet to have seen any conflict, with all the units and cities blissfully undamaged. This’ll be the last time you see such a peaceful shot for some time.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Why Does the Fallout Look Like That Anyway"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The world is about to turn day-glo, as nukes are dropped left right and centre. First to feel the nuclear force is La Paz, a Kulin city in South America bordering Malacca. South America really was a cursed continent this time around, wasn’t it? Kulin do seem to have successfully carpeted the area, though the proliferation of puppeted cities means they won’t be able to replenish their front lines here easily. Their best bet is a snatch-and-grab victory with what forces they do have, before suing for quick peace.</p>"

  scene_title: "FLASH"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>BOOM! A fantastic action shot of Laredo being obliterated by a nuclear missile. You know, I sure am glad this is just a video game. There’s one thing worth noting in this slide - the nuclear bomb seems to have reset Laredo’s defence value to a far more reasonable 187. Looks like the key to taking out cheatin’ Rosillo is going to have to be nuclear.</p>"

  scene_title: "Tipping Point"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Pictures taken moments before disaster. Peaceful Tipasa is about to be rocked by a missile itself. Of course, the city isn’t just a sleepy island town - it’s one of the Vandals’ key airbases, so it’s no shock to see it targeted so early. The Vandalic army here is technically a carpet, though they hold so few land tiles I’m not sure how much it will count for in the grand scheme of things.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Palmed Off"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Med starts to run red, as Zaire-held Avellino takes its first damage. But that’s not the true story of this slide. The banner at the top is the only indication of another elimination: the final city of Palmares, Papaloapan, falls to the Marajoara (who also seem to have taken a couple cities from the Kulin and one of the Vandal Brazil colonies).</p><p></p><p>That Palmares should fall to Marajoara isn’t really surprising, but it sure came about in a roundabout way. Zumbi has had a pretty miserable game, relegated to a corner of Brazil for the majority of the game by the more expansive nations of the Marajoara and Paraguay. They bled a city every few centuries, before finally being worn down once and for all by Paraguay… but not before gaining a city from the Olmecs in a bizarre peace treaty. So instead of heading to the sub, Zumbi instead enjoyed retirement on a single tile in Central America, in a city that weirdly didn’t appear as a capital, despite being their only city. In the end they managed to stay there many years, outliving their would-be conquerors Paraguay and even the Mapuche to become South America’s second longest-living civ. But their demise in this episode was so inevitable we didn’t even dedicate a slide to it. Tragic. Palmares fall in 25th place.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vandals once held a mighty empire across the Caribbean, but it’s been reduced to just a single city now, Panormus. And I wouldn’t grow too attached to it, as it’s already started to take serious damage. P’küee should be in total control here, with the only other units being some doomed embarked Chukchi suckers.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Get Used to This"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Marajoara take first blood in South America (well, they move before the Kulin, so that was inevitable). Temu Ko’s on the right side of the Andes for an easy capture, but William Barak could certainly float back in without too much trouble on his turn. This will be a very flippy front.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Hlot to Trot"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>You’ll be astonished to hear that this city will fall this turn. Hlotse, long surrounded by superior Zairean forces, didn’t really stand a chance. The real test for Mobutu is if he can turn this into a structured attack on Lesotho’s core. He won’t make any progress against Nigeria, so this is his best bet for a strong showing going into the next cycle. Those huge unit models to the top left look even more imposing now we’ve zoomed in.</p><p></p><p>In other news, the Neutrals are still dead, but now also at war with every other civ on the Cylinder, so they’ll probably soon be super-dead. This has been your daily Neutral update.</p>"

  scene_title: "Barghash Is At the Wheel, Zanzibar are BACK"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>I don’t care what anyone says: Zanzibar is in this. All they have to do is use that privateer to capture some advanced units, let the Nigerian navy burn itself out on the Marajoara, and swoop in to take what remains. Actually, I can’t see any way this fails. Zanzibar #1. Per the minimap (and my secret spreadsheet), Punjab took a city in Arabia and another in Cambodia.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Breaching the Urals"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s our first original capital flip of the episode, as Perm’s old stomping ground of Cherdyn falls to PARG. This is the first active conflict we’ve seen between Red and White Russia - a much hyped rivalry going into the game, the stubbornness of Perm kept the two nations apart for much of history. This shot alone tells us who should be the favourites here - the Soviet land is covered only by Kulin’s former peacekeepers, who will surely ravage the land before being killed off, leaving it even more open for those White Russian death robots. In the minimap, Nigeria takes their first blood - and thanks to their abundant peacekeepers, it’s German Essen in the Balkans that falls. It remains to be seen if these peacekeeper conquests (err, warbringers?) will hold longer than a couple of turns, but Nigeria and the Kulin will surely hold a few weird exclaves when all is said and done.</p>"

  scene_title: "Gauling Proposition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>A big talking point going into this episode was the viability of Gaul. For a while they were ruled out as a footstool for Germany to leap from, but the longer they’ve stuck around the more their stats have shaped up. Their men on the ground are sorely lacking, though. They should deal with the warbringers blotting their territory but they’ll have to rebuild fast to rival Germany - who, need I remind you, receive a production bonus for every civ they’re at war with. Yikes. Still, Barcelona at least is isolated and surrounded by enemies, so I can’t see that particular German exclave sticking around much longer. Meanwhile, the Chola take three cities in Indonesia, East Africa and Cambodia (the one they just lost to Punjab). The Chukchi take a city from Taiping and, er, that Lesotho city that was reduced to a single tile. And Two Sicilies take a city! They reclaim Cyprus from the Germans. Hopefully Ferdinand doesn’t get too used to victory.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Who said you can’t take cities from Rio Grande? The Dene stroll into the former Mississippian Fox Farm. Rio Grande’s border cities aren’t quite up to the ridiculous defence stats of their core, so Thanadelthur could potentially see further early success on this front. Rio Grande does look to have bolstered their forces up here though, so it’ll be slow going either way. Uzbekistan manages to grab a couple cities: the city in Oman they lost to Punjab earlier in the turn, and a Zairean outpost on the Caspian.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Things aren’t so good on the home front, though. Lenin seems to only have about ten units to his name, but you can’t say he doesn’t know how to use them effectively. He marches straight into Margilan, and while it’ll likely flip back, it bodes well for Lenin’s less-is-more fighting style. He’ll also manage to reclaim Cherdyn before his turn is through, as well as Mtskheta on the Black Sea from Kosovo.</p>"

  scene_title: "Are the Kulin Finally Going to Settle Kangaroo Island Though"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>In a strange echo of a time gone by, the Australian superpower’s capital appears to have been nuked. I can only assume it was by some native New Zealand separatists. If there’s any surety about the course of this episode, it’s that the Kulin will probably be okay. Australia’s a tough nut to crack when you’re not also fighting every other civ on the cylinder. The test for the Kulin will be holding onto their colonies, not their core. Genseric takes his Brazilian holdout back from the Marajoara.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In case there was any question as to if the Chukchi’s brazen conquest of Hlotse was the first spark of a huge southern African wildfire… no, no it’s going to fall back to Zaire or Nigeria or even Punjab imminently. Weird warbringer conquests are fun, but the true battles will be fought on the borders. Off-screen, Lesotho reclaim Malindi from the Chola, which they lost earlier this turn. On-screen, he appears to be bombing Zaire for all they’re worth, with both Goma and Bukavu in deep black.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The same goes for the Nigerian colony of Essen: an interesting diversion, but it won’t be long until it’s reincorporated into Deutschland. Kosovo’s capital is already suffering relentless bombardment, and off-screen their Ukrainian city of Ferizaj falls to Germany. It’ll be a miracle if they make it through this episode in one piece.</p>"

  scene_title: "Zanzibarred"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>One civ that certainly wasn’t going to make it out of this one alive was Zanzibar, and their final Antarctic holdout falls to the Kulin, eliminating them in 24th. Even just having been conquered, the city stands at 118 population - an absolute megapolis.</p><p></p><p>It feels like a lot of the eulogies I’ll have to give this episode are going to be underachievers. Zanzibar certainly fit that mold, though their story wasn’t without its twists and turns. They had a decent start, settling a couple of mainland cities and standing up to an at-the-time superior Somalia without much of a fuss. But then, as some civs do, they just stopped. Unwilling to settle much more of Africa, they let their available land be gobbled up by Lesotho, opting for a couple of towns in the Seychelles instead. After a series of wars with a number of powers, they briefly found themselves relegated to Oman, in an ironic twist on the old Bill Wurtz meme. But eventually they wound up stuck in a single city in the bitter colds of the Southern Ocean, where they did nothing. Except breed. They did a lot of breeding. Zanzibar leaves memories, but not much of a legacy.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, this was a busy turn, with Malacca and the Kulin both having moved. Mansur Shah mostly consolidated his homeland, taking the recently Punjabi city of Sai Gon as well as a couple cities from the Chola and that stray German city in Baja California. Their only wild conquest is Paraitonion, right in the heart of Arabia. The Kulin meanwhile mostly focused on South America, wiping out the Malaccan colony and reclaiming Temu Ko. They also claimed a Polynesian island from Malacca and Taiping’s long-forgotten Kyushu settlement.The next slide’s gonna be a bit much, so bear with me...</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode21-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>So unfortunately there’s a whole turn of screenshots missing due to a reload. I think this might have happened a few times in the game before, but usually you wouldn’t notice, you know? Only one or two serious things usually change in a turn. That’s obviously not the case in Total War, so going solely off the minimaps let’s quickly sum up the events of 1156…</p><p>In Europe the Vandals take a Gaulish city in Spain, while Germany removes that Nigerian blight while capturing the Kosovar capital, Pristina. The USSR has a decidedly mixed turn, seizing the Caucasus from Uzbekistan but losing their entire eastern borderlands to Kulin warbringers.</p><p></p><p>In Africa, it’s a bit of a manic exchange. Nigeria takes a city from the Vandals and Zaire, the latter also losing one to Uzbekistan. The Kulin and the Chola both take stray cities from Lesotho. In the Middle East, the entire southern coast of Arabia changes hands, split between Zaire, the Chola, Uzbekistan and Punjab, the latter making advances on Zaire-held Iraq. Laos lives to continue self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>In Asia, the Uzbeks lose a city to PARG and somehow the Chukchi, who also unite Japan. Taiping suffers losses to Malacca, Northern Yuan and the pure emptiness of nuclear destruction, with a city wiped from the map. Punjab takes a city from Chola on continental India, while the Cambodian city that keeps changing hands is Chukchi-controlled.</p><p></p><p>In South America, the Vandals swap out one of their colonies for another, while the Marajoara get rid of the helpless Kulin exclave of Caracas. In the North, Rio Grande takes back Fox Farm while the Chukchi advance down the coast of California. Right, back to regular proceedings! No more skipped turns thankfully.</p><p></p><p>The Vandalic capital is looking very vulnerable, likely from heavy bombing, and the Nigerians certainly could find a way into the city. Eradicating the Vandals should really be Nigeria’s priority 1; their territory in North Africa is fairly ill-protected, but their overall outreach is great enough that they’d probably enter the next Cycle with some healthy bonuses. If they could take their capital and have their government exiled to, say, New England, they could even transplant the threat onto their rivals.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Germany isn’t quite going for the wild, transcontinental captures of the Kulin - but he does manage to grab a little exclave, the city of Acre, which was Kosovar before Total War. Kosovo could definitely see themselves torn to shreds over the next few turns, as multitudes of XComs from all over the Cylinder converge on the remnants of their empire. But Rugova has never gone down without his guns firmly blazing, and the tiny naval detachment just outside Acre should be enough to retake it, if they aren’t destroyed before they get the opportunity.</p>"

It seems most civs have bigger fish to fry than Kosovo, and they’re being largely ignored, only Wilhelm sending a token nanohive Prizreni.

Wiltwyck and Heemstede are both sure to fall, though later conquests will run up against the still-powerful Marajoarmada. Every city on this slide was founded by New Netherland.

Rosillo only really stands to gain from total war thanks to his ridiculous defence values, and so far he’s making full use of the opportunity, with serious forces advancing on Dene-held Kuruvunga too.

But any attempt to take the city is a forlorn hope - a defence value of 819 will ensure Nodena’s going nowhere, and any units that stray near it are sure to be annihilated (thank heavens it only gets one attack a turn). Over time, I’ve come to accept the weird, wonderful and patently unfair glitches that the CBR throws up as part of the chaos. But I’m definitely glad this one’s since been patched.</p>"

But they do share a small land border, and it’s Rosillo who’s pushing the advantage currently, sending a few units to bother the heavily damaged city of Palaloapan. But these appear to be the last units Rio Grande have hanging about this area - in the long run, I’d expect the huge Marajoara reserves to eradicate the attackers and eventually swamp Rio Grande’s former Olmec holdings. Before being annihilated by the ridiculous city defence values, of course.</p>"

It does seem the end is imminent, though, as Marajoara forces swarm Severino and advance on the colony’s administrative centre. If the Vandals are to make anything of this long-held endeavour, it’ll be with naval support while the Marajoara fleet is preoccupied with dealing with Rosillo.</p>"

Perhaps aware of this relative frailty, Rio Grande has firmly reinforced the area, ensuring any naval snipe would be short-lived. At the top of the screen, Rosillo’s forces converge on Terwe Dorp; it’s a little hard to call as we can’t see the full context of the battle, but Genseric certainly doesn’t seem to have the naval supremacy we’ve come to expect of him in this area.</p>"

It should fall to Zaire sooner rather than later, as Mobutu also reclaims Hlotse, which has to be the most flipped city of the wars so far.

But almost as impressive has been their tendency to cling on to distant territories by reinforcing naval conquests with a strong presence on the ground - it’s a tactic the Vandals have been using to great effect all game, but the Chola are doing it with a fraction of the production and army size. Even in Total War, Raja Raja clings onto the Horn of Africa for dear life, and I don’t see nearby Zaire or Nigeria managing to make inroads for some time.</p>"

But with the city on zero health and Punjabi XCom standing right there, it will of course fall to Ranjit Singh when he takes his turn, which as we can at the top left is next.

I’ll be frank, I expected the city to fall to Zaire or the Soviets almost immediately, but it seems all world leaders have respected Fa Ngum’s wish to go out in style. In fact, they’ve helped Fa Ngum along - bombing raids have reduced the population of Qamislo to 1, meaning that unless it’s taken very soon, the city will vanish before the turn is up. But German and Zairean units are poised right outside the city’s ramparts - will either of them put an end to Fa Ngum’s masochistic madness, or are they simply there to watch?</p>"

As the Chukchi exclave of Pakse falls back to Punjab, the front in Odisha remains as much a mess as ever. Katharagama is being assaulted by a Nexus that’s somehow snuck behind the front lines, while Chola units stroll into the heart of India a little aimlessly. A strong navy in the Bay of Bengal should ensure the safety of Sarpang for the time being.

The area around Tripoli is eerily empty - one of the Cylinder’s few safe havens at the moment. In total Awolowo takes eleven cities this turn, claiming mainland African cities from both Zaire and the Vandals, Caucasus territory from Lenin, a stray city in central China from Mandukhai and even Malacca-held South Georgia.

Surely a more concerted push into Northern Yuan would have proved more fruitful? Well, maybe Kolchack’s burned by the last miserable failure of a war against them - or maybe he’s realised this might be the best strategy after all. Uzbekistan are a fair bit weaker than they used to be, and joining in the dogpile on them ensures they’ll be, at best, a very minor player come Cycle 2. In turn, that’ll give PARG ample space to grow peacefully with little threat for the first few eras - Northern Yuan will (presumably?) start in Karakoram, a fair throw away from White Russia, while the mountain range that separated Kolchak from his bitter rival Lenin should still prove a handy natural barrier as it did the first time around.</p>"

The former Permian capital of Pokcha actually looks pretty secure at the moment, with the only foreign intruder in the territory being a nearly-dead Punjabi XCom. The GDRs just over the border in White Russia might prove a nasty threat, but we have to ask: just where is the Red Army?

These recent conquests should hold, I think, but any further incursions are sure to fall prey to the oldest tale in the book of CBR - the eternal land-sea flip. Genseric still rules the waves, and shouldn’t let any of these coastal cities slip away without rapid retribution.

With that said, the settler they’ve sent isn’t escorted, and may well be captured by the German XCom looking on bemused. Bibracte, deep in the red and now a border city, suddenly looks very vulnerable indeed - but the Gaulish army still seems to be hanging together. Meanwhile Lenin has responded to my accusations of weakness by sweeping through the Caucasus, nabbing a Kosovar city and even retaking one of the Kulin’s conquests.

Both Laos and Vietnam squabbled inefficiently, dooming them to mutual irrelevancy. Fa Ngum’s main military “success” was avoiding being destroyed by the Chola for a few generations. But all that changed this episode, when out of nowhere they notched up two eliminations. Kurdistan and… themselves. We’ve talked about civs declaring suicidal wars before as a self-inflicted coup de grâce. But this is another level. This is the stuff of legends.

This turn Mansur Shah did manage to take five cities, four of which were tiny islands, and the other being a former Tongva city, Puyunga. In stranger news, the former Namibian capital of Windhoek is captured by Wilhelm II, making its time as a Lesothoan settlement incredibly brief.

Elsewhere Nigeria have taken a stray city that they’re likely to lose next turn, while just northeast Kunming has been completely eviscerated. Northern Yuan will also grab Kansk and Wusong before the turn’s up, on their southwest borders. The Kulin meanwhile take a huge swathe of Malaccanesia as expected, as well as a handful of other scattered cities, like Sosnogorsk in North Russia and strangest of all, the former Kosovar capital of Pristina.</p>"

This is maybe the first eulogy of this episode for a civ that wasn’t a total washout; Two Sicilies were regularly seen as a promising possible breakout, holding their own against their powerful neighbours despite constant invasions. But in a way, that made them even more disappointing - they never made good on that huge potential. Despite having among the largest and most advanced navies in the region - not half helped by their powerful UA - they adamantly refused to use it, despite it being possibly mighty enough to wipe out even the Vandals’ core, never mind the Ptolemies or Spain.

It seems strange to say, but the Nigerian colony of Mogadishu might be coming in good use here - they’ve not lost it all war, and it certainly feels like it’s been a good jumping off point for their agitations in East Africa and Arabia.

This could be significant for several reasons - not only does it prove a significant blow to the Vandals, but it also throws their capital into a random new location. And as a reminder, come Cycle 2, civs will start from their capital as of the final turn of this episode… so Nigeria might well have permanently relocated the Vandals to North America, Brazil or even Greenland! But before you get too excited… Hippo Regius will almost certainly flip back this turn, returning capital status to the city. Still, Nigeria’s dominance is clear at this point. They’ve taken another three cities from Zaire’s core, and the Zanzibar archipelago from Lesotho, as well as a handful of other Vandal cities. Titanic.</p>"

They benefited early on from one of those rivals, Wales, proving to be an easy pushover, while also winning early wars against Germany and managing to remove Spain from most of their core territory. From there though they remained pretty stifled, unable to seize an advantage against their main land neighbours, the powerful Germany, and unwilling to build a navy capable of rivalling local sealords the Vandals. They started to slip back in the stats, but luckily caught up just in time for Total War, where they finally made some gains against Germany. They go into Cycle 2 in only a slightly less tight position than they started, though - sure, no Spain or Wales to contend with, but still closely monitored by the Vandals and Germany, the two nations that boxed them in all game. They’ll have to strike quickly against one of them in Cycle 2 if they want to be this game’s Moors. They finish Phase 1 with 2 original capitals, with Welsh Caerdydd their only prize.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Germany traditionally ranked higher than Gaul in the Power Rankings, though in truth despite superior stats they largely found themselves in a similar position - enjoying early success in wars against minnows like the Teutons and Sweden, before failing to strike out against more challenging neighbours like Gaul or the Soviets. Instead they wiled away their days with constant conflicts with Two Sicilies, a war that took them all game to finally win. This episode was a little bruising for them, taking the Kosovar capital but little else of note, while losing a couple of border cities to Gaul. Still, their aggressive AI and useful UA should prove equally tenacious next Cycle, and my advice remains similar to Gaul - strike early. Despite feeling a little underwhelming, they finish with a very healthy 6 capitals - Berlin, Marienburg, Reykjavik and Naples conquered before today, and Pristina and Stockholm taken in the heat of Total War.</p><p></p><p>We don’t get a shot of Finland, but despite their optimistic stab at a military campaign this episode, they end Cycle 1 with just the three cities: Kotka, Viipuri and Riga, so no original capitals. We don’t even know which one the new capital is! As I mentioned earlier, Finland easily wins the award for least eventful civ, neither taking nor ceding a city for the entire game until Total War made it inevitable. They start the game on an empty peninsula, but a powerful neighbour in Lenin combined with rubbish starting bonuses should ensure they’re not much more than early fodder come Cycle 2.</p>"

A few early successes against the Teutons and Perm aside, they spent the majority of the Cycle also refraining from any serious wars, leaving Perm to exist for most of the game as a helpful buffer state between them and their much-touted rivals the White Russians. Unlike Finland, they settled well enough that such stagnation didn’t do them much harm, and by Total War they had the firepower to make serious gains against the Uzbeks - even if temporarily losing their Permian holdings to the Kulin was a little embarrassing (William Barak did manage to finish the game with Pechora still in his hands). With nothing separating them and PARG next time, I expect we’ll finally see the bitter war between the two Russias that we’ve long been anticipating next cycle - but Germany remains the Soviets’ most immediate rival. The USSR finishes with four original capitals, adding Helsinki to their pre-total war collection of Moscow, Cherdyn and Tbilisi.</p>"

It caps off what’s been a decent if spotty performance in this game, building a strong solid core with some decent stats… up until the last few episodes, where their science completely trailed off. It’s pretty telling they never really won any of their wars, stalemating PARG and underperforming against Bhutan and Kurdistan - at least not until a bonkers invasion of Sweden. In Cycle 2 their starting bonuses are sure to have taken a massive hit; placed right between Punjab and PARG, it’s going to be very difficult for Karimov to turn his nation into anything other than a stepping stone for a greater power.

I’d give Rugova four turns max if the game were to continue. But, such is the nature of the rolls of the dice that make up any AI game, Kosovo will be returning for Cycle 2 from their (non-original) capital of Gjilani. They were up against it from the off really, bothered early on by power players Germany and Two Sicilies, and unable to expand much into the rough terrains of Anatolia. But despite briefly losing their capital, they managed to mostly hold onto the integrity of their territory, fighting off the Soviets in one memorable border clash. Still, they were always minnows of the continent, and as such will start with terrible bonuses going into Cycle 2. On the other hand, they’ll have the Middle East as their own personal playground, so it’s not unfeasible they could create something for themselves. If Kosovo survives certain death at the hands of Germany to become a power in Cycle 2, it will delight and irritate certain fans of this game to no end, I’m sure.</p>"

Their true breakout came more recently, launching successful inter-continental invasions of Hejaz and Kurdistan (even if the latter took a while to pull off). But when Total War came knocking, they found themselves at the mercy of powerful Nigeria and an opportunistic Lesotho with no other rivals to fight. They will start Cycle 2 bruised and compromised, and right on Nigeria’s doorstep, from their non-original capital of Likasi. They do finish the game with one original capital, though - no one managed to take the Kurdish capital of Hewlêr‎ from them.</p><p></p><p>We don’t get a shot of Nigeria, but needless to say they’ll be starting from their original capital of Lagos. They’ve been model examples of a CBR power - reacting to the early forward settles of Burkina Faso with decisive military action that essentially wiped out Sankara’s chances of competing, investing heavily in science and as a result gaining many of the most powerful wonders, and using that advantage to wipe out a notable rival in the Ptolemies. Total War also went very well, neutering their nearest rival Zaire and expanding further into the Middle East to consolidate as much power as they could. There’s only real shortcoming - allowing the Vandals to stick around in Africa. Without their potential threat, Cycle 2 would have looked incredibly cushy for Awolowo. He finished this Cycle with the most original capitals - seven. That’s Lagos, Kinshasa, the Tuaregs’ Abalessa, Ouagadougou, Mecca, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Emphatic.</p>"

Some drew the line higher than others - Uzbekistan, Northern Yuan, Two Sicilies… But my cut-off point was Lesotho. Their way to victory was fairly simple but very luck-based: try to avoid being too murdered in Total War, and take advantage of a potentially weakened Zaire very early on to build a strong core - then hope Nigeria and the Vandals get too bogged down fighting each other to do much else. Well, so far so good! Zaire were devastated by Total War; Lesotho took advantage of the chaos, snagging a few more cities, while avoiding the possible danger of Chola or Malaccan naval raids. It’s a successful end to a fairly uneventful game, in which Moshoeshoe found himself in early scraps with Namibia that mostly petered out, while not daring to touch Zaire and seeming to forget Zanzibar existed (who can blame them there?) Lesotho didn’t crumble when the Chola came sailing, and instead walks out of Cycle 1 with their heads held high and a remarkable 4 original capitals: their own, Windhoek, Zanzibar and Mogadishu, which they actually managed to grab off Nigeria.</p>"

They managed to avoid attracting the ire of any of them, instead leaving Total War with remarkably similar borders to how they entered it, albeit grabbing a little corner of Uzbekistan. That suits them just fine. They’ll start with healthy bonuses thanks to their impressive stats that always belied their unimpressive performances. And on top of that, they’ll be in oodles of space - no Perm, a much weaker Northern Yuan and Uzbekistan, and they should get a good few centuries before they have to worry about Punjab again. Their best bet for success is to double-tag the USSR with Germany, but even without that they have ample space and time to rebuild even stronger. After all, we saw a similar thing happen with the underperforming Kazakhs in CBRX1.

  narration: "<p>As with Kosovo, who’s to say what would’ve happened with Northern Yuan if the game had only run a little longer? But unlike Kosovo, it feels much more deserved that we’ll be seeing Mandukhai again for Cycle 2. First in the Part 0 Power Rankings, Northern Yuan would never impress us that much in the game proper thanks to consistently terrible tech and a tendency to get bogged down in neverending stalemates, mostly with Southern Yuan. That said, they held on bravely against assaults from the more powerful PARG, and towards the end of the game beat back minor players like the Manchu, Japan and - eventually - Yuan. A more protracted Total War could have been devastating for them, but as it is they’ll enter Cycle 2 with a middling array of stats and a fair bit of room to expand. Hopefully they have as much luck fighting off Kolchak as they did in Cycle 1, as he’ll once again be Mandukhai’s main rival. She finishes with two original capitals, just about keeping control of Manchu Mukden alongside her own.</p><p></p><p>No shot of the Chukchi capital, but they’ll be starting from Kagyrgyn. A civ we had relatively few expectations for thanks to a fairly miserable tundra start, the Chukchi surprised us time and time again, using their relative isolation to launch powerful naval attacks against nearby rivals Japan, Hawai’i and the Chinook, and settling confidently on both sides of the Bering Strait. Make no mistake, their powerful starting bonuses alone won’t be enough to replicate that success - they’ll want to hone those exact same strategies to break out in Cycle 2. But as we’ve seen, they’re more than capable, and they definitely enter Cycle 2 as a frontrunner. They boast five original capitals: alongside their own they picked up Honolulu, Tokyo, Chinook and the Tongva capital of Juyubit.</p>"

Well, that won’t affect them in Cycle 2, where they’re set to have an excellent start. For a start, they’ll be rid of Bhutan, who proved a strangely irritating thorn in Punjab’s side for many centuries, much weaker than them but strangely difficult to shift. Instead Punjab focussed west, expanding heavily in that direction and bothering both Hejaz and Kurdistan. They used peacetime effectively, bolstering their stats in every parameter, and effectively utilised them late-game to finally push through Bhutan, as well as Indochina and parts of Central Asia. Total War went fine - a bit of land from the Uzbeks, a smidgen of Arabia. Of course, there’s one civ they’ll feel shame at not managing to shift, but we’ll talk about them soon.

  narration: "<p>So, let’s talk about the elephant in Ranjit Singh’s throne room. When Punjab started to pull ahead, the existence of the Chola felt almost as fragile as Bhutan’s. Their elimination seemed a formality on Punjab’s path to greatness. But that’s not what happened: despite their previous achievements being limited to annoying Laos, sneaking a couple of cities from Hejaz and almost eliminating a comatose VOC, the Chola threw everything into defending their homeland against multiple Punjabi invasions. Against all odds, they succeeded - though while their stats never rivalled Punjab’s, they were hardly shabby, and in a more charitable area they might have thrived a little more potently. Total War saw few permanent border changes for the Chola, and they should enter Cycle 2 with fairly decent starting bonuses. Less than Punjab, of course, but they’ve been underdogs to Punjab all game - I think there’s every chance they could turn the subcontinent around. They only finish with their own original capital, losing colonies like Zanzibar and Batavia in Total War.Before we leave Asia for the time being, let’s just remember Taiping, because apparently the auto-camera didn’t. Taiping boasted a powerful early game core with much weaker neighbours on all sides: Yuan, Bhutan, Laos and Vietnam. It’s maybe not fair to say they butchered their invasion attempts - they did take a couple cities from Kublai Khan, and a forward settle from Bhutan - but being as boxed-in as they were they were going to need more than a few potshots to compete in the long run. Any hope of that came to a swift end when rising star Malacca made mincemeat of their southern territories, and Taiping persisted only as a map-filler ever since. They were likely one turn from death when Total War ended, but escaped the fury of anyone looking for a cheap easy kill in the time since then, and thus will start Cycle 2 from Jiujiang, a little west of their original capital. Safe to say they won’t last long.</p>"

As expected, the Kulin spent most of the game investing in naval units, expanding into the South Pacific but failing to break through to Asia. But they had an unprecedented amount of success in South America, first taking a couple of cities from the Marajoara before absolutely eviscerating the Mapuche, in perhaps the game’s most impressive single-civ annihilation. They’ll start Cycle 2 with some of the most impressive stat bonuses. But will it matter? The next map will be significantly smaller, transforming Australia from a huge continent to a more marginal landmass, mostly deserted. It might prove too small to build a proper power base, as happened with Australia in CBRX1’s Endgame - and they didn’t have an ultra-powerful and naval-focussed civ in Indochina to worry about. The Kulin will have to expand rapidly if they want to contend, and will have much more of an uphill battle than other frontrunners with comparable stats.

Well, all three of those proved disappointing, but the Marajoara were hardly blowing anyone out of the water early on; we long considered South America a continent full of equally weak nations (and Peru-Bolivia). P’küee’s ascent was slow: subtly expanding into the Caribbean to bolster her navy, and following Nigeria’s footsteps in focussing on science. A comprehensive invasion of Gran Colombia followed, setting the Marajoara as the continent’s clear frontrunners. From there, barely a foot was put wrong. Allowing Paraguay and Palmares to wear each other out before sweeping through Paraguay, removing most of the Vandal presence from the Caribbean, these were all power plays that set her in great stead going into Total War. In truth, that war was about damage control - with a powerful Kulin to the south and a completely unkillable Rio Grande to the north, the chief operation was to stay intact. Stay intact they did, and as a result they find themselves in an incredible position for Cycle 2: top tier stat boosts, and a continent entirely to themselves. It would take a series of blunders the likes of which we’ve rarely seen for the Marajoara to not emerge as a frontrunner in Cycle 2.

But Rio Grande built a surprisingly powerful little core, and just as Tuskaloosa started to overstretch himself, Rosillo pounced, transforming Rio Grande into North America’s premier power almost overnight. That’s when the controversy started - a broken UB gave Rio Grande completely unassailable defence values that all but ensured they’d keep their current power level at a minimum to the end of the Cycle. Later wars with a broken New Netherland proved fruitful, but the Marajoara and the Dene both stubbornly refused to cede much ground, including during Total War. As a result Rio Grande will start with a great array of stats, though probably only equalling the Dene and the Marajoara, not surpassing. And yes - the bug is fixed, so they’ll have no such get-out-of-jail cards next time round. They finish with three original capitals, boasting Cahokia and Coatzacalcos, the erstwhile Olmec capital.

Still, from the early conquest of Two Affiliated Tribes to grabbing significant chunks from the Mississippi and the Tongva, the Dene quite calmly rose above the highs and lows of a very volatile continent. They even held their own against Rosillo, swiping border cities from him before he could build his broken UB there. Cycle 2 should prove a comfortable early game before nearby rivals the Chukchi and Rio Grande draw close - bat the Chukchi back into Asia early, and they definitely stand a chance of uniting the continent.

Since Episode 7 they’ve stayed in the top 2 in every ranking - a dominance no CBR contender has rivalled since the heyday of the Boers. So what set them apart?Well, Malacca were never really a conventional frontrunner. Most of the iconic powerful CBR civs ruled continents, but Malacca ruled the oceans. For much of the game their navy was completely unbeatable, as proven by their massacre of a then-powerful Taiping; it was only the recent rise of the Kulin that provided them with a formidable rival, and Total War suggested that Barak might have swiped the edge off his rival, though not significantly enough to cause a significant dent in Mansur Shah’s empire. But similar to the Boers, Malacca’s dominance of the PRs definitely owed more to potential and safety than impressive power plays. In fact Malacca’s most interesting achievements almost felt like side-projects, particularly their invasion of the Tongva. They never really converted their huge statistical lead over their neighbours into something incredible the way, say, Nigeria did. Still, they’ll go into the next Cycle with said lead mostly intact, and without Vietnam, Laos and VOC to eat potential city sites. Expand as quickly as they did this Cycle, possibly focussing more on a significant land base in Indochina, and there’s no doubt Malacca could re-establish themselves as front-runners once again.

  narration: "<p>We come to our final entrants into Cycle 2: Genseric’s Vandals. Only Jamaica and Hawai’i ranked lower than the Vandals in the Episode 0 PRs - we put them lower than VOC and Tahiti! Expectations were rock bottom for the Vandals following the early eliminations of Algeria and Libya in CBRX1 and an unimpressive track record in previous AI games. But the Vandals scored something of an easier life than we expected. Burkina Faso fumbled an early impressive showing, while the Tuareg performed very poorly from the off. Across the Med, Spain focussed their efforts entirely northward, and the once-terrifying Two Sicilies simply never invaded. Still, an Africa dominated by the Ptolemies and Nigeria was going to be a difficult landmass to establish themselves in. So they chose a different option: similarly to Malacca, they used a decent statistical array and a metric ton of ships to dominate an ocean, rather than a continent. Their most memorable showing was against New Netherland, completely decimating one of North America’s most promising up-and-comers - but they also swiped the Palmares capital in a complete smash-and-grab conflict. That said, they’ve taken a few hits in Total War, losing some of the Eastern Seaboard to the Dene and Rio Grande and a bit of Africa to Nigeria, and it remains to be seen what that’s done to their stats. Assuming the damage isn’t too bad, they’re in a decent position for Cycle 2, with the obvious caveat that Nigeria will be breathing down their neck much sooner. On the other hand, the Mediterranean is theirs, with Spain, Two Sicilies, Kosovo and the Ptolemies things of the past. Another strong naval showing should make them another force to be reckoned with. They finish Cycle 1 with 4 original capitals: Hippo Regius, Madrid, Nieuw-Amsterdam and the Palmares capital of Macaco, clung to against all odds.</p><p></p><p>Well, take a deep breath. That’s the last you’ll see of this map. Come next episode we’re launching into Cycle 2, resetting our combatants to the Ancient Era on a smaller and more competitive map. I’ve been told in good confidence that it’ll be as chaotic and entertaining as this Cycle has been. And you won’t have long to wait to find out:  the first episode of CBRX2: Cycle 2 will be dropping December 15th. That’s right - no lengthy hiatuses this time, we’re dropping straight back into things.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, follow the subreddit or Discord channel for more information like the bonuses given to each civ. If you’d like, check out my Google map of Cycle 1, which I’ll be updating for the final time shortly after this episode drops. And check out my Google Map for Cycle 2, which is just getting started. I’ve been LacsiraxAriscal. This has been CBRX Cycle 1. See you soon for the sequel.</p>"
