    narration: "<p>Ahoy everyone! This is Vivala, aka u/vivalahomestar - part time community member, part time modder, most of the time lurker - here to give you your Seabricks fix. Now that the early wars are in full swing, we get to see how the rest of the cylinder reacts, which civs can hold up under pressure, and which civs really start to throw their weight around. It’s gonna be an exciting time, and I want to thank the team for giving me the opportunity to narrate so early in the game!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Our OC for this week coincidentally comes from last episode’s narrator, HillSpawn! I’m pretty sure Thanadelthur is the first leader to get a new civball based on her performance. Given the efficient takedown and torching of Four Bears’ northern cities, I’d say she’s earned it.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Today’s map is the BabylonMap by u/ARedundantSofa, which was released within mere hours of last episode. Not only is it fast, but it’s pretty to look at, and the clear borders make it really easy to read at a glance. I know I was checking it a lot when writing this episode.</p>"

    narration: "<p>All-Russia ascends to the top spot, overtaking Northern Yuan and Burkina Faso. Sporting a tech advantage and lots of open land to gobble up, Kolchak has the potential to be a force to be reckoned with. Will he live up to this potential, or will he, like his predecessors at the top, fall from grace?</p>"

    scene_title: "Greens Going Down"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene06.jpg
    narration: "<p>We start on the northern coast of South America, where Spanish Town remains in a precarious position. Things haven’t exactly gotten worse than the last time we saw the city, but that Gran Colombian army is still an existential threat.</p><p>To the East, P'küee enters her war room after many days deep in thought. Each South American leader has had their own take on the Paraguayan menace, and hers is especially unique. If she can’t beat Lopez, she might as well use his wrath to her advantage. Perhaps a two-front war could net her some Palmarean cities.</p>"

    scene_title: "Tactical Retreat"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene07.jpg
    narration: "<p>Wilhelm II was so elated to hear about the tiny, undefended city of Lutetia that he didn’t stop to listen to his generals’ warning about the terrain. Assaulting Lutetia required a nightmarish trek through Gaul-infested woods, and assaulting Gergovia required a grinding slog through marshy riverlands. The terrain proved too much for the exhausted German troops, and they were forced to pull back to Vienna. That city is safely in German hands, but the others may take longer than expected to seize.</p><p>To the West, Welsh forces bring Santiago de Compostela closer to collapse.</p>"

    scene_title: "Georgians in Exile"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene08.jpg
    narration: "<p>To the Georgian soldier, a plucky lad of 18 freshly deployed from Tbilisi, the lands of Gori were completely alien. The ground was totally flat, as if some god had come and chopped down the hills, and a nigh impenetrable layer of snow and frost coated the fields. It was miserable. Every time he asked his captain what they were doing there, he was told it was to guard the copper mine, but every time he checked the deposits, there was no such mine. What had he done to deserve this pointless, frozen hellscape?</p>"

    scene_title: "Ill-fated Amphibious Assault"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene09.jpg
    narration: "<p>War rages between Japan and Chukchi. Though the war was Kakuei’s idea, his forces have had little luck so far. Japan has enough ground units in the area to potentially take a city like Uvelen, but they’re scattered to the winds, split between Honshu, Hokkaido, and the Sea of Japan. Lawtiliwadlin isn’t in any position to take cities either, but the defense of his lands should be simple enough.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene10.jpg
    narration: "<p>Seeing Solano Lopez’s feeble attempts to invade Palmares, Lautaro gets a bit cocky and plops Newken right next to his enemy, a good ways away from his own land. </p><p>P'küee is fully committing to her war with Zumbi, but the jungle is dense and Subupira is well defended. The city may fall, but it will be a harsh fight to take it.</p>"

    scene_title: "Jacob Morenga’s Bad Day"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>Things are not looking great for Namibia. Rehoboth looks set to fall to Zaire, Seko is about to lock Namibia in with a settler, and Lesothan troops are swarming around Kactchanas. Favorable terrain and a decent army prevent these attacks from being existential threats to Namibia, but they could spell an end to Morenga’s dreams of being a regional power.</p><p>Meanwhile, Genseric realizes that what his fragmented empire really needs is some good infrastructure, so he builds a set of huge triangles to motivate his workers. In lands unknown to Morenga and Genseric, Thanadelthur ceases hostilities with Four Bears.</p>"

    scene_title: "Just Standing There... Menacingly"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene12.jpg
    narration: "<p>Thakhek is about to collapse, but the Vietnamese offensive’s one adjacent melee unit is weak. If Fa Ngum can play his cards right, he might keep the city. At least, that’s what he tells himself. Those Malaccan troops are awfully close, and if Mansur Shah declares war, it’s over.</p><p>Just out of view to the North is the last’s slide’s new religion. Though the residents of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom have long worshipped their leader as the brother of Christ, it wasn’t until recently that someone compiled Hong Xiuquan’s words into a holy text, forming the basis of Bai Shangdi.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene13.jpg
    narration: "<p>Though this screenshot just shows Kolchak declaring war, Kublai Khan also joined the fight against the Manchu. Nurhaci appeared calm in his speech to his troops, noting that the Yuan “are a bunch of dumb barbarians, so we have nothing to worry about.” But things changed as troops began to return from the front lines. They reported that the Yuan were at least as advanced as the Manchu troops, and a select few soldiers were furious with Nurhaci for supposedly lying to them.</p><p>Also of note, Hong Xiuquan peaced out with Kublai Khan, allowing him to focus his attention on Nurhaci.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Lenin’s grip on Danzig grows stronger by the day. Hermann von Salza rushes troops in from Konigsberg, but it may be too little too late. The Teutons can at least rest easy knowing the rest of the Red Army is contained in the Soviet core.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene15.jpg

    scene_title: "Hubris, Meet Lopez"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene16.jpg
    narration: "<p>Solano Lopez took Lautaro’s latest settle the same way he takes everything: as an insult. He was so insulted, in fact, that he diverted his invasion force away from Palmares, towards Newken.</p><p>Meanwhile, P'küee struggles to invade Subupira, but advances a settler to the South to box in Zumbi.</p>"
  - scene_number: 17
    scene_title: "More Anger at Morenga"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Last slide, we saw Zanzibar jump on the Namibia hate train, and on this slide we see the Vandals do the same. The fighting has drained both Morenga and Moshoeshoe’s armies to the point where the Southern front of the war is virtually empty. Instead, the action is centered around Kactchanas, where Zaire and Lesotho struggle to break the Namibians’ resolve.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>Uzbek troops push to the West towards the Kurdish city of Elih. Though war has not been declared yet, the residents of the city fear they will soon be sacrificed to the whims of Islam Karimov.</p><p>Nearby, a far-flung group of Georgian colonists undergo a strange transformation. Ever since the city received its name of Dvin, the residents have become enamoured with exercise, and buff legs are the new normal.</p>"

    scene_title: "Spanish Town’s Going Down"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>Spanish Town is on its last legs. Though Jamaican forces have managed to beat back Gran Colombia’s melee troops, it is only a matter of time before the city falls. Does this spell the end of the $JAM stock bubble?</p><p>To the South, Lautaro reacts to attacks by Solano Lopez by doubling down on traditional faith. A collection of beliefs are codified and standardized across the civilization, resulting in the newly-forged Witran Mapu religion.</p>"
  - scene_number: 20
    scene_title: "Subpar Subupira Invasion"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>P'küee utters a select few swears towards Solano Lopez as she receives word of the siege of Subupira. Sure, her forces are getting closer every day, but this was supposed to be a swift victory, not a grind. At this rate, she’ll be left much more vulnerable, even if she manages to take the city.</p>"

    scene_title: "Bashed By Boats"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>Lawtiliwadlin, sick of errant Japanese troops harassing his citizens, decides to finally strike back. He calls for two ships in his core to venture to the city of Nagaoka and see what they achieve. The triremes likely aren’t enough to take the city, but they should make Kakuei a bit worried.</p>"

    scene_title: "Cleopatran Chaos"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene22.jpg
    narration: "<p>With the Red Sea between it and the rest of the empire, Hermoupolis is an easy target for any Middle Eastern civ. Mustafa Barzani decides to go for it, sending a mass of troops from Sine. However, it wouldn’t be a Civ Battle Royale without peacekeepers, and today some Hejazi chariot archers decided to play that role.</p><p>Somalia also joined the war against Cleopatra, but with many miles of tiles between them, it’s unclear how much Barre will be able to contribute.</p>"

    scene_title: "Trading One Foe For Another"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene23.jpg
    narration: "<p>In the time since we last saw Laos, Fa Ngum managed to peace out with Vietnam, but just as feared, Mansur Shah quickly swooped in to attack Thakhek instead (along with Hong Xiuquan). The defense of the city is going well enough, but there are enough Malaccan troops to take it in time.</p><p>Malacca itself has taken on an interesting shape. With most of the islands blanketed by jungle, Malacca opted to expand by water. The result is a civ that spans the critical waterways of Southeast Asia, but leaves many openings for opportunistic neighbors to snatch nearby land.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>Thomas Sankara has been busy since we last saw him. He launched a war against the Tuareg back on turn 64, and quickly plopped down the city of Fada N’gourma in the golden hills near the Tuareg capital. The Tuareg’s defensive prowess and the army surrounding Abalessa may slow the Burkinabe troops down, but that may not be enough to keep Sankara’s revolution out of the desert.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cleopatra makes peace with Kosovo.</p>"

    scene_title: "(Really) Spanish Town"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>Gran Colombia has finally captured Spanish Town! Though now the Spanish-speaking troops are a little confused on what to call it. English Town? Town? When asked what he would call it, Bolivar simply replied “Mine.”</p><p>This slide also gives us a good perspective on how empty the Caribbean is. Cuba, Hispaniola, and roughly 13 other islands lay up for grabs.</p>"

    scene_title: "The War that Wasn’t"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene26.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Ural Mountains are quiet. Believe it or not, Perm and All-Russia are at war right now. However, nature has blessed Saint Stephen with a defense Kolchak cannot overcome. Kolchak has since founded two cities closer to the front, Arkhangel’sk and Chita, but they have yet to bring him any closer to victory.</p><p>In other parts of the world, Cleopatra makes peace with the Tuareg, Punjab formally adopts Sikhism as its religion, and Wales, though its notification is not present, adopts Anglicanism.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Hussein bin Ali finally begins the work of claiming the Arabian Peninsula for Hejaz. Since the end of last episode, he’s settled Yanbu and Tabuk and has another settler ready to go. These cities, particularly Tabuk, can only stay around as long as Kurdistan tolerates them, unless Hejaz can seriously build up its army.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mansur Shah celebrates his (hopeful) victory over Laos by constructing a massive monument in Malacca: the Parthenon.</p>"

    scene_title: "Boats Work? Who Would’ve Guessed?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene28.jpg
    narration: "<p>The Chukchi seize Nagaoka, which leaves Osaka completely cut off from the rest of the empire. This is a disaster for Kakuei, and throws a major wrench into both his war against the Chukchi and his efforts to form a continental empire.</p><p>The Manchu settled the city of Girin nearby. If Nurhaci makes it out of this war with the Yuan, then we could see a Manchu-Chukchi war along this border.</p>"

    scene_title: "Everything’s Coming Up Morenga"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene29.jpg
    narration: "<p>Against the odds, Namibia not only managed to hold on to Rehoboth, but it also drove away the remaining Lesothan troops. Zaire is still a bit of a threat, but this war is proof that Jacob Morenga should not be underestimated. If he can rebuild faster than his neighbors (which he already has a leg up on), he may become a regional power after all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wales finally makes peace with Spain. While Llywelyn didn’t strengthen his foothold on the continent, he did hold on to his settlement in Brittany, which is better than many previous British powers can say.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Dene and Chukchi’s chances of settling Alaska are growing dimmer as the Chinook creep up the coast, settling Wahkiakum and preparing to follow up with another city. Thanadelthur’s fiery wrath has thus far been concentrated on Four Bears, but Comcomly may have to contend with it soon enough.</p><p>Down in South America, tensions over Cerro de Potosi boil over into all-out war between Peru-Bolivia and the Mapuche.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The mountains, jungle, and Punjab have shielded the Chola and Bhutan from each other so far, but fighting finally breaks out as a Chola ship pulls into the waters around Phuntsholing. Though this battle will not be consequential, both leaders hope to demonstrate their might as they prepare to expand towards other civs. You can see one Chola settler and two Bhutanese settlers preparing to head out.</p>"

    narration: "<p>A new settlement of pale-skinned strangers popped up near the city of Niagara. The local Neutral delegation quickly arrived with a peace offering: beaver pelts, which the pale-skinned settlers had always gone wild for. Yet these strangers rejected the offer and seemed to only want to talk about fish.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Antonio Canales Rosillo was frustrated by the loss of Saltillo, but he wasn’t the sort of man to wallow in self-pity. He wouldn’t just roll over and give North America to the Mississippi. Without hesitation, he sent two settlers to the East, one of which quickly settled Tampico in the Mississippi River delta.</p><p>Over in Great Perm, what had once been a quiet reverence for Saint Stephen had grown to a fever pitch as the “war” with All-Russia went on. Soon, Stephen’s influence over local faith had grown so strong that it branched off into a new religion: Eastern Orthodoxy.</p>"

    narration: "<p>La Guerra de Potosi quickly ground to a halt. Lautaro’s troops are too sparse to make a meaningful assault on Lima and Andres de Santa Cruz’s troops are stuck in the mountain passes. Barring a miracle or major intervention, this war likely won’t go anywhere.</p>"

Solano Lopez, content to see Lautaro stuck in a war against Peru-Bolivia, turns his attention away from Newken and begins to damage Dambrapanga, while P'küee finally damages Subupira.</p><p>Back in Asia, Kolchak is content that Punjab will be a good ally to Bhutan, and exits the war with the Chola.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Hejazi peacekeepers finally abandon their efforts, leaving Hermoupolis to the mercy of Kurdistan. Cleopatra seems to have realized that the city is a lost cause, and opted to keep her troops in Africa. Or perhaps she’s preparing to mount a defence against Two Sicilies now that Ferdinand I is attempting an assault across the Mediterranean.</p>"

The desert may burn hot, but Sankara’s revolution burns hotter - so hot, in fact, that Ubari begins to burn to the ground. Sankara has sent a clear message to the Tuareg: those who do not join the revolution will be crushed by it. And he is more than happy to spend production replacing them with a city of his own.</p>"

Those frustrated soldiers from the start of the war turned into full on revolutionaries, spreading word that Nurhaci was a liar and an unworthy ruler.

    narration: "<p>After countless years of war, Palmares and Paraguay finally make peace. Zumbi, seeing his army weaning and the Marajoaran army still advancing, trades away Dambrapanga in exchange for a quicker peace. Lopez expected to feel joy when he finally got his hands on the city, but after such a long and exhausting war, all he could feel was frustration.</p><p>“What should we do with the city, Presidente?” one of his troops asked.</p><p>Lopez let out a long sigh as he turned away and walked towards his horse. “Burn it.”</p>"

Cleopatra founds Dodekatheism, calling back to the 12 gods supposedly living on top of a mountain in her ancient homeland. Mustafa Barzani founds Yazdanism, or the “Cult of Angels” as some call it, rejecting the faith pushed by nearby Jerusalem.</p><p>And there we have it, that’s every single religion that can be founded! Though other civilizations carry their own beliefs, the weight of these faiths will soon push out and bury these “heathen religions” and the civs that founded their own will come to reap the benefits.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Elih is back in Uzbekistan’s hands. After that little stunt, Islam Karimov wants to teach Kurdistan a lesson, so he moves his troops closer to the Kurdish core. But Kurdistan is ready for them, and if Karimov expects another easy capture, he’ll be sorely disappointed.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Here we get a good look at Zanzibar’s core. Though the army isn’t especially intimidating, their cities are big and prosperous. Together, these are more than enough to hold off the paltry Somalian troops struggling to get through the mountains.</p><p>We can also see Zaire slowly attempting to fill out the rest of the Congo, partially encircling Lesotho in the process.</p>"

    narration: "<p>With his cities still on the brink of collapse, even after making peace with the Yuan, Nurhaci desperately seeks peace with All-Russia as well. Kolchak, high off of his recent victory in the war against Perm, and sensing Nurhaci’s desperation, manages to snag Girin in the process. Of course, he didn’t even want it. He burns it to the ground, savoring the feeling of taking it away from his old foe. The air is rich with ash as a tenth city begins to burn.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mobutu Sese Seko still proudly flies the banner of the Jacob Morenga Hate Club, even as his allies abandon him and the war grinds to a halt. Both sides have decently sized armies, but both armies are destined to die in a meatgrinder.</p><p>Over in North America, Antonio Canales Rosillo declares war against Lautaro, not because he thinks he’ll capture a city, but because he knows Bolivar could be a key ally down the line.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The battle for Alesia continues, and Ferdinand I’s navy has gained the upper hand. Even if the city would be hard to keep, merely flipping it could be a major blow to Vercingetorix.</p><p>The web of wars in South America grows more complicated as Zumbi declares war against Lautaro.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The residents of Osaka found the city of Kashiwazaki. The citizens of this new city have never been to Honshu, and Tokyo is but a legend to them. They would say they were Japanese if someone asked, but their loyalty is primarily to Osaka.</p><p>Hoping he can pull off a repeat of his success with the Manchu, Kolchak declares war on the Chukchi.</p><p>Down South, Hong Xiuquan finally calls off his ambiguously holy war against Laos.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Having spotted a Spanish settler, the German trireme followed it farther and farther until it found itself alone in an unfamiliar part of the world. Whereas before you could always find land if you went far enough, this part of the sea seemed to stretch out forever. They dared not cross into the deep water, for fear they would never return.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode3-scene103.jpg
    narration: "<p>Here we get a good look at a couple of fairly new Tuareg cities, Kidal and Ubari, and the western Vandal empire. The war with Spain drained most of the units from the region, but otherwise the Vandals got by with minimal damage. It helps that the Tuareg are in no position to invade. The Vandals also settle Cirta on what I believe is Cape Verde.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rio Grande settles Monclova farther East, giving us an excuse to finally see New Netherlands. Peter Stuyvesant hasn’t been especially active in this episode, but he has been happily (if slowly) expanding and growing each city to impressive sizes. I wouldn’t call New Netherlands irrelevant, but they’re hardly out of the running.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mandukhai was watching the Yuan-Manchu War carefully, and she was quick to notice that none of the chaos was due to Yuan troops. Surely Kublain Khan must be an incompetent commander. This was enough evidence for her to launch a new war, one that would prove once and for all that Northern Yuan is Best Yuan. However, both civs look equally matched at the moment.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mansur Shah finally gets his hands on Thakhek in a peace deal and, well, you can guess what happens. The VOC employees stationed at Pontianak look on in horror as a great trading partner goes up in smoke. That’s number eleven, folks.</p><p>Vietnam ignores this destruction and founds a new city, with another on the way soon.</p>"

    narration: "<p>And now, Australia! What is usually a highly contested and closely watched continent has been quiet so far. The Kulin and Anangu have slowly worked to claim their halves of the continent and so far haven’t come to blows over it. To be honest, the most exciting part of this scene is the Hawaiian city of Hilo in Papua New Guinea, but even then, I don’t expect a crazy overseas empire from Lili'uokalani.</p>"

    narration: "<p>After throwing Spain around, Vercingetorix gets a taste of his own medicine from Carlos’s son, Ferdinand. Alesia falls to the Two Sicilies.

    narration: "<p>We started this part with Vietnam and Laos at war, so as we near the end, let’s get back to that, shall we? Between the terrain and Laos’s defensive ring, Ho Chi Minh may not break through easily, but he could soften them up for later.</p><p>In perhaps bigger news, the Gauls and Two Sicilies make peace, with Alesia still in Ferdinand’s hands. This is a tremendous loss for Vercingetorix who lost a valuable coastal city and gave Ferdinand a staging ground on his side of the Alps.</p>"

    narration: "<p>I gotta hand it to Lautaro, he’s beaten my expectations multiple times. I expected this war with Peru-Bolivia to be a total dud, but not only did he take out Lima, he’s now busting into the core. That Peru-Bolivian settler will buy him some time, but it seems like the beginning of the end for Andres de Santa Cruz.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Ranjit Singh declares a war on a foe he can’t reach, and Mustafa Barzani gives up on Hermoupolis. But the focus of this final slide should really be on one settler. After a tense ride through the chaotic waves of the Pacific, the Tahitian settlers have arrived on a beautiful paradise - a land they dubbed Aotearoa.</p><p>I want to thank BC again for giving me the opportunity to narrate one of the season’s opening episodes. It’s been an absolute blast!</p>"
