Take a good long look at it folks, as these borders surely will not last. </p><p></p><p>While we’re at it though, a big shout-out to you other map makers out there, wherever you are!

    narration: "<p>Someone was gonna have to make the Anangus joke eventually, I, u/yaampa, just went ahead and pulled the trigger. Looking back, this is probably the worst tribute I’ve ever seen to a civ, ever. What did Tjilpi do to deserve this slander (other than send his troops to drown in the Pacific but that’s neither here or there)? What sins have I committed here?</p>"

You’ve been quite the whack civ this whole season, but that doesn’t mean you weren’t entertaining as hell to watch. Godspeed.</p>"

The Kulin do look to have reinforcements coming from the west but I don’t know if it’s enough to get all the way to South America.</p>"

    narration: "<p>For the absolutely appalling crime of doing borderline nothing these past couple of episodes, the world’s leaders have come to the conclusion to place an embargo on Mansur Shah.</p><p></p><p>Also we see Nigeria take an L as their bid to enact Cultural Heritage sites fails.

    narration: "<p>Al Jumum falls to Punjabi paratroopers as the Cholan bid to try and take it back looks worse for wear.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the navies of both sides here aren’t looking so hot. Though we can see Ranjit Singh’s distinct tech advantage here in comparison to Raja Raja.</p>"

    narration: "<p>As expected the Dene catch onto Tuskalooska’s shenanigans and take back Jaketown, and with no melee units nearby his antics on the Lakes have come to a close. In fact, Thanadelthur strikes back by taking Spiro and Mound Bottom.</p><p></p><p>Also what in God’s name is a Chukchi carrier doing in the Great Lakes?</p>"

    narration: "<p>You forgot this war was still a thing didn’t you? Don’t worry, I forgot too.</p><p></p><p>That said, it looks like things are beginning to heat up between Malacca and Big River as Yaanga begins taking damage. They do have the units to take it, but reinforcing it will be tough, especially with the mass of Kulin vacationers, who especially are enamored by the ruins of an ancient civilization known for their loud language and comparisons to another ancient society historians refer to as “New Zealand.”</p>"

    scene_title: "Wrath of the Chanclas"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode17-scene17.jpg
    narration: "<p>Kanchipuram and Katharagama have fallen to Punjab, meanwhile Chola has recaptured Sarpang. Both sides still have a ton of reinforcements to continue this flipfest.</p><p></p><p>Inspired by the status of their cities, as well as low ammo reserves, soldiers on both sides seem to have resorted to throwing discarded flip-flops. What was once thought to have been somewhat painful at first is now regarded as a WMD by both sides, capable of inhumane amounts of pain and suffering. Both sides agreed to completely ban it’s usage immediately.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Uzbekistan has seemed to consolidate its newfound Swedish gains quite well, and despite some cities still healing, the peninsula has found itself a nice light green carpet.</p><p></p><p>The actual Sweden, on the other hand, has seen skyrocketing cases of hypothermia, for fairly obvious reasons.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Paraguay and Palmares have made peace, leaving Zumbi to his stay at Papaloapan resort, which in reality is just some homeless camp within a Marajoaran super-citadel but don’t tell him that.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile the Vandal navy here is looking quite sparse, which is even more concerning seeing as the German and Marajoaran navies both surround and outnumber it considerably.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The war between Big River and Malacca has found it’s way towards Malacca’s Pacific holdings, as Antonio’s Missile Cruisers begin to engage Mansur Shah’s privateers, in a battle between tech and numbers.</p><p></p><p>Back on the mainland, I have devised a crackpot theory regarding Rosillo’s stupid high defense numbers: Rosillo is obviously this season’s shonen protagonist (well, fallen protag now) and those city defense levels are merely a visual representation of his plot armor.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We finally see a flip in this war as Yaanga has fallen to the Big River. It looks to be temporary, however, as Malacca still has a considerable force adjacent, and Rosillo’s invading force is still pretty pitiful.

P’kuee looks to be able to retake Meheti’a with a spare ironclad.</p><p></p><p>What was once a riptide is now nothing but a little ripple in the waters of the Pacific.

It can build railroads, but upon moving a rail route it loses all mobility, and becomes a powerful ranged unit. Could be of excellent use in a defensive war.</p><p>Also look at those city populations! If you read up on the Power Rankings, you’d know that PARG’s food production has glitched to ridiculous levels. Will it be inconsequential? Will it be as stupid broken as the River’s defense levels?

Alas, they were none of those things, and had practically doomed themselves to irrelevancy by Episode 3. They would be one hard nut to crack due to the terrain, however, and through that they managed to live. It would eventually be the Vandals that would end the Neutrals long watch over this world.
