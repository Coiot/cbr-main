  narration: "<p>We gaze upon our current PR leader… the kings of cool, welcome the Chukchi! If you glance at their empire, they have everything you can ever want to succeed. A powerful army, good stats, and a recent evisceration of your closest foe. Will they keep the throne though? Lets find out!</p>"

  scene_title: "Past The Urals"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>In our first slide, we glance at the capture of Ufa by a heroic ulhan division. Overseen by the Great General, comrade William “The Conqueror”, this capture helps solidify some good news for the red Russians and bad news for the white Russians - the USSR has overcome the Ural wall. Ufa will not stay red for long, and the other city beyond the wall, Samara, is also prepped for an assault from Kolchak. However, this remains a bad omen for the White Russians</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a look at Malacca, now a husk of its former glory. Just 2 episodes ago, it was looking rather fine and dandy. Now, they have been completely eviscerated by a coalition led by the Chukchi and Kulin. The remains of the core can hold on for a bit thanks to the brave souls of the Malaccan army. However, never again shall they stand anywhere near the peak. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh, how can we forget the other major component of this brutal coalition! Lesotho! After some rank incompetence resulted in the green boys holding on to the coast, they are sweeping the undefended Malaccan African Territories. Every single city in this episode of the world is at threat of falling to the bulls in green, and there is nary a thing Mansur Shah can do about it. He chugs another bottle. He knows no god, and all he can do is stare at the abyss. </p>"

  scene_title: "Mare Nostrum"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, an eye at the great Vandal heartland. A highly advanced steppe horde led by the great warlord Genseric, the Vandals control the Mediterranean, and have recently acquired new properties in Wales. While their land army is nearly non-existent, their steadfast navy is more than enough to keep them safe. They just entered the atomic era, and in spite of the threat from Lesotho they are otherwise in a fairly decent position. </p>"

  scene_title: "Hard Starboard!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca continues their erstwhile retreat to the east as Kananga falls to Lesotho and Malaccan Yemen is due for the same treatment. The Punjabis and Vandals look on in awe at the collapse of a grand empire. Speaking of Lesotho, they did make a big comeback in this cycle. From the runt of Africa to an eminent world power, things seem to be looking up for Moeshoeshoe and his pals. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Herein lies the Chukchi Chinese Sea, consisting of a snapshot of their domains in southern Japan, China and Indochina. The Chukchi navy isn’t quite as massive as it once was, but its still an incredibly impressive force more than capable of cleaning up most world powers. Destroyers, Landships, Infantry and more litter the speckled coasts, awaiting further orders. </p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Its Cold Out Here"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Dene huddle together in their arctic megacities. Their UA and their great growth focus have resulted in fairly large cities in spite of the poor terrain, particularly looking at the 88 pop city of Somba’Ke, one of the largest cities on the cylinder. The Chukchi people live their happy lives under the great guidance of the great bear in the sky. They don’t have much, and they know their doom will come one day, but Thanadelthurs theocratic state has well prepared them for their meeting with the great spirit in the sky. </p>"

  scene_title: "March of the White Walkers"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi navy glances menacingly at the pitiful remains of the Malaccan empire. A menagerie of destroyers and embarked horsemen. Pathetic. Though the Chukchi fleet isn’t committing much to the front anymore, they don’t need to commit much of anything. Singapura is doomed and Malacca is in the yellow. This has been an overwhelming victory for Lawtiliwadlin. In one fell swoop he has established hegemony across his half of the cylinder, and booked a ticket as one of the final powers. The White Walkers shall march!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ranjit Singh eyes deviously at the collapse of Malacca. Left and right, his erstwhile foe is losing massive ground. It is time. Time to repay them for bottling them in by sweeping Southern India. Immediately, the outpost of Vaga is seized by a destroyer battalion, and Malaccan Dravidia is highly undefended, especially since the Malaccan navy, once oh so powerful, is now fairly obsolete to the cruisers and destroyers that dominate the cylinder. </p>"

  scene_title: "We Aren’t in Gaul No More"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Gaulish expatriates of Cenabaum left the burning lands of Europe to live in the frigid north of America. Unfortunately, the local Dene seem to disagree with their adventurous plight, and the defenseless town is integrated into the Dene domain. They don’t mind too much. Its safer this way, and the Dene won’t massacre them. </p><p>As an aside, this also means the Gauls only city is the former Finnish city of Turku. They have literally become Finland. </p>"

  scene_title: "Abandon Ship"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mansur Shah launches a sneaky plan to prevent his demise. At the umpteenth hour of Malacca being lost, he gives out the entirety of his domain to the Chukchi, barring the doomed overseas colonies. This should theoretically provide a shield that prevents Kulin and Punjabi incursions into his core. Which may be necessary, as the Punjabi army is flooding into the undefended Dravidian area and the Kulin just took Rawalpindi, securing Java. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>He also gave Mokotholong to the Chukchi as an act of spite against Lesotho. The Malaccan African Project is still doomed nevertheless, with the Basotho tide crashing past the hull of the once mighty ship. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Line of Skulls"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>A look at the All-Russian Ural Line shows a strange sight. The All-Russians have gotten into train fever, building dozens of Bronpoezed, a powerful landship replacement that can only move across rail. Since many of these wastes have no railroads, the skull-signed men can’t exactly approach too well. However, they serve as an ample barricade to prevent further incursion into Omsk. In addition, these trains actually passively build railroads beneath them to allow movement, and a legion of lancers are available to take back Omsk from the Soviet landships. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Southern Front"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Urals and the Line of Skulls prevent progress in the north, the Red Army have mustered their forces for an assault in the south. The brilliant great general Mordecai Gur is in charge of this operation, and the plan is simple. Push through from the damaged city of Samara, flank the Wall of Skulls and capture Omsk. Surely they cannot be repelled, can they? </p>"

  scene_title: "Melter"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>In spite of their move to envelop themselves in permafrost, the Malaccan empire continues to melt away, with Pazhaiyarai falling to Punjab millenia after they were robbed of it. The former Chola lands should also be ripe for the picking from the Orange Gunners. </p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Intercontinental Agreements"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho and Marajoara sign a research agreement with one another. A mutually beneficial signal of friendship between two rising powers. Remember, the Marajoara have a small colony in the Ivory Coast, taken from the ruinous corpse of Nigeria. Also, a brief reminder that Lesotho is still operating with a 19th century navy in 2026. Aside from the carriers. They’re probably made from wood. </p>"

  scene_title: "Charming, Eh?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Marajoara celebrate the completion of the Camutins (CN) Tower, a behemoth of a broadcast tower that sends out a subtle signal encouraging reproduction. It also helps send out cultural propaganda, though that doesn’t quite matter. P’Kuee looks proudly from its top observatory. Her cities are massive, her armies sprawl across the continent, and things are looking quite swell for the no.1</p>"

  scene_title: "Another Glance"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a look back in Indonesia, where a trio of Soviet scouts have been enveloped within Riau. You were way too late for ScoutCon buddy. Meanwhile, we also eye the relatively developed Kulin navy brandishing their new gain of Rawalpindi, and the pitiful Malaccan navy. </p>"

  scene_title: "White Silence"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, Siberia, a peaceful domicile. With the exception of Karakorum, the cities here are noticeably smaller than most major global cities. There is also nary a unit here, be it from the Chukchi or the PARG. Barring the Great Ice Sheet Fleet 2.0. The people here live their honest lives off the land, the once blazing fires no longer visible in the frigid waste. What once remained of Mandukhai is but a burning memory. </p>"

  scene_title: "Guess Whos Back"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Genseric has a dream. Of a different time. When the Vandals ruled the waves in the American east coast. When they didn’t just rule the Atlantic, they dominated it. He then realizes that there is a prime opportunity to make that dream a reality. Rio Grande is crumbling under the might of the Marajoara, and from the outpost of Carthago, a regiment of steamships are on deck to seize Pesqueria Grande.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hat-Fu"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Lesotho forces get to work practicing the sacred art that all people must know - the humble art of Hat-Fu. Pioneered by the great general Fu Hao, this marshal art has taken all the rage in the Basotho domain, with even Moeshoeshoe taking up the sport. These newly trained warriors are well on their way to crane kicking Malacca out of Africa, though they may need to figure out how to get down from those helicopters. </p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Friendly Army"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Marajoara send a small armored regiment into the newly acquired, and unfortified, Sahelian possessions of Lesotho. Its just a small military training exercise as a show of friendship. Nothing more, nothing less. The local citizens look on with little awe. They have seen these types many, many times before, in many, many timelines. They’re just happy the Marajoara are just flexing muscle… for now. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Qacha’s Nek gets captured, choking off Morija and Quithing from one another! This brutality all but dooms the remnants of the Malaccan African Project. It might take just a bit longer though, given the position of the Basotho armed forces. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Red Sea Sharks"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here, we get a sight at the newly consolidated Red Sea. The blood of thousands of Malaccans, Vandals, Nigerians and Basotho lay under the pristine waves, but that matters not now. Jos is Lesotho’s land, while the Punjabis have seized Vaga. In addition, it seems that there have been several enterprising citadels filibustered through the Rub-Al-Khali, causing Jos and Wazirabad to have direct borders with one another and greatly increasing Lesotho's power projection into the east. Could this be a source of strife? </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>After a few decades of uncontested rule under the fist of Malacca, the people of Morija decide to Morj’ up and assist the antique Lesotho navy into their shores. A regiment of paratroopers parade around town to celebrate the recapture of a once out-of-grasp loss. If only the poor people of Quithing can get the same treatment…</p>"

  scene_title: "The Samaran Offensive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Red Army flex their might on the town of Samara. A reinforced and experienced retinue of tanks and infantrymen march into the near-undefended town, held only by a brave retinue of artillery and their Anti-Air support nearby. The PARG army seems fairly thinned out, and what remains have elected to form a defensive line between Novonikolayevisk and Namangan instead of supporting Samara. It seems almost inevitable that the city, currently in the red, will be waving the red hammer. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>After 2 millenia, Punjab manages to almost completely stake their claim on the Dravidian plain. Remember, at the very start of Cycle 2 they bodied the Chola to completely annex their lands only to get bodied themselves by an unexpected Malaccan invasion. Ranjit Singh grins menacingly. Yes, its coming home. Once more. We’ll get it all back. We’re coming back. With a vengeance. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Man, aside from Malaccas collapse and the Russian Wars of Unification, things aren’t really that bloody in the cylinder are they? Well, lets take a look at the civ with the Bulls Blood warrior UU, Lesotho. Once thought to be the rump of Africa, Lesotho has established themselves as quite possibly the biggest contender in the continent. Though the Malaccan invasions have left their mark on </p>"

  scene_title: "Mother Russia’s Grasp"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Samaran offensive was a resounding success, with the city being secured in Soviet hands. However, The Wall of Skulls, now made of a mass retinue of retrofitted, highly mobile armored corps, have proven to be a threat to the somewhat sparse Soviet army, and will certainly pose difficulty in pushing deeper into All-Russian territory. As a result, Lenin opts to make peace with his erstwhile rival, letting them off the hook relatively lightly, with only a couple of cities falling. </p>"

  scene_title: "Grim Embrace"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>The remnants of Malaccas once sprawling empire are about to fall. Terangganu is the last non-capital city Malacca still holds, as the once Punjabi city of Hazara gets secured by Lesotho forces. And even that is being enveloped by a horde of Punjabi seamen!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Terangganu falls to the clutches of Punjab. The bright moon shines as the last Malaccans throw up the white flag. The moon shines on Ranjit Singh. He has taken what was rightfully his. And he plans on getting the last laugh. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>We see the town of Kaduna, captured by the Kulin recently in the Malaccan war. A tiny tundra isle, it is of little importance, but William Barak uses its capture as a cause of celebration anyways. No worries mate! </p>"

  scene_title: "You Held Me Tight"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Malaccans hang on to their hats. Peace has not been signed with the Punjabis, who are out for blood. Excursionary forces are threading past Chukchi lands, and there really isn’t much needed to take Malacca itself, the last stronghold of the empire. Mansur Shah brings up what remains of his generals. The fleet is gone. And they shall defend to their last breath. Unease fills the room. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the Kulin heartland, the vast continent of Australia. As we can see, their cities have very respectable stats, and have become a popular stopover for enterprising Marajoara army men. In fact, they have gotten fairly absorbed in the local culture, many declaring theres no place like the Kulin empire.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Pesqueria Grande gets taken by the Vandals once again, reducing the city's population even more.Though it will likely flip back, Genseric made his mark by defacing the local monument with insulting images and rhymes.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a look at the vast, yet compact Soviet empire. Decently populated cities enveloping the territory of the European Warsaw pact, and a loyal orchestra of seamen and armymen stationed across the nation. The fugitive rapper the Notorious B.I.G. has made waves across the nation, his great hymn “Juicy” helping wake many to the plight of the Soviets. A Kulin explorer observes in awe, from a German farm just outside of Nizhny Novgorod. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Two episodes ago, Malaccas army was one of the biggestin the (admittedly small) world. Now it has been reduced to 2 poor infantrymen and a destroyer. The Siak battalion oversee the crossing of two battleships into the Straits of Malacca. Mansur Shah is quickly becoming a king of nothing. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Inspired by the dark, brooding and violent lyrics of the Notorious B.I.G.'s biggest hits, Lenin surmises that the best way to prevent such scandalous incidents from rocking the Soviet veneer of stability would be to pay a visit to his more vulgar southern neighbors and to politely ask them to stop inspiring such tracks. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Rio Grande (Big River) would probably be more accurately be referred to as Pequeno Grande (Small River) right now. Pesqueira Grande has fallen yet again to the clutches of the Vandals. And lets be real here - that absolute evisceration by the Marajoara has done quite the number on the fragmented empire. They aren’t even on a river anymore, they’re on a lake! Formerly owned by the Neutrals!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Remember Mansur Shahs ingenious plan to envelop himself in the Chukchi to prevent incursions? Yeah, that is not going to plan. The Punjabis have sent a large task force through Chukchi lands in order to end Malacca once in for all. Battleships and landships have congregated near the Isthmus of Kra. The end is coming. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The citizens of Dalu Twe find an ancient book, a travesty of the Dene teachings. In it, lay a strange collage of wars and battles, a great series of teachings. An epic tale of struggle, bravery and victory, of rebellion and struggle. It was written in a dialect strangely reminiscent of the Rio Grande dialect, leading them to believe that it is fate that Rosillo will save them. The defection of a 21 citizen city is surely a massive blow in the Denes' already tiny empire, and a nice prize for the struggling Rio Grande.</p><p>The books title? How to fight wars good. Mexican edition. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode32-scene48.jpg
  narration: "<p>We take a moment to chastise the most uncultured civilizations within the cylinder (although most of them are already long dead). Taking a look in the list of corpses, we find a very big discrepancy which explains the defection of Dalu Twe. Somehow, the Dene are making absolutely no culture. Like, their cultural output is 0, making their empire susceptible to cultural influences and ideology flips. Even the Finnish Gauls, a pitiful OPM, and the long dead civilization of Zaire have higher cultural output than that. How in the name of the frigid gods is that possible! (Probably bankruptcy and glitches if I have to guess) </p>"

Mansur Shah smiles wryly from his crumbling palace. He made it further than any one of his foolish early rivals could've predicted. The VOC, Taiping, Laos, Vietnam. He outlasted them all. But here it comes. His fall.</p>"

William Slim, in shades and in command of the local forces in the frontline town of Cologne, opts not to push his luck, retaining the local Vandal defense force in a defensive line. By contrast, the Vandal navy continues to bombard Frankfurt into the red, despite having no easy way to take it. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Alexa, play Pedro Pascal crying over Space Song. </p><p></p><p>We cry over the death of a legend. Malacca came into the BR with the lowest of expectations. A bad start, an AI not renowned for being particularly expansionist, uniques that at first glance aren’t game-changing. And yet, by the will of the gods, they managed to go on an absolute tear of a run. A series of very good settles early on provided a great power base, compounded by the incompetence of the VOC and Anangu. The Jong proved to be an absolute monster of a unit, thanks to upgrading as a cheap Caravel and helping provide Malacca an additional powerful middgame naval unit. And Laos, Vietnam and Taiping all proved to have languished. With that, the Jongs rang their gongs and helped sweep up practically all of the China Sea. From the coasts of Canton to the outermost isles of Nusantara, if you had a coast in the east, you were liable to getting eaten by Malacca. They led in science and growth, and were the number 1 seed for very long stretches of time, never leaving the top 2 within Cycle 1. Hell, in the very last episode of the cycle, they even managed to stake their claim as the one true Chinese civ! </p><p></p><p>Come cycle 2, everyone knew that they wouldn’t replicate their miracle run to the same extent in spite of their massive buffs thanks to the amazing cycle 1. Nevertheless, they still managed to bring the hype with the conquest of the Dravidian Plain from Punjab and the invasion of Madagascar, creating an empire that dominated the Indian Ocean instead of the China Sea. Unfortunately, their ambitions grew too wide in the latter conquest, and after incompetent management ruined what should’ve been a sweep of the Swahili coast, the Chukchi and Kulin browed down the once mighty empire with a great coalition, before the Punjabis drove in the blade. </p><p></p><p>Have a good one in the party sub Mansur Shah.

The crewmen in said boats are set on a new task - scout out locations for an offensive in Greenland, the last holdout of the Imperial Germans. Wilhelm sweats. The wind blows. It smells of smoke and crimson. </p>"

The tank of Tashkent sits by the outskirts of the city, determined to slow the Punjabi hordes down, even by a little. Its in red, so it can reasonably be flipped…</p>"

Namagan is well reinforced with an aerial battalion of 8 planes and a bunch of tanks and artillery nearby. If Punjab is to take the city, they must give their assault with caution. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Wilhelm despairs within a bunker in the city of Kattowitz. The eastern coast had just fallen, and there is little hope left. The voices. They are getting louder. When he sees the mirror all he sees is him. He calls for shouts of purity and for aggression. But that is impossible! As he continues to tap around and go mad, the German high command simply sigh in resignation. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Panning the camera a bit we see that Wilhelm has good reason to worry. The Soviets are rounding the bay and planning for a decisive strike into the heart of the western shores of Greenland. Though no harm has been dealt just yet, a large invasion could end the Germans once in for all. </p>"

  narration: "<p>P’kuee has determined that the recent Vandal action against Rio Grande is one step too far for these marauders, and decides it is high time to send them back whence they came! Immediately Saltillo surrenders to Marajoara forces, with the rest of Vandal America instantly prepared for a swift capture. This war is complete ruination for Genseric, given how open he has showed himself lately. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The last slide has failed to account how the Marajoara have a very large armed force prepped off Onitsha, showing such an operation has been in the spanner for a while. Saldae is taken to the black, and Caralis and Cartagena should probably be on high alert for the upcoming Arthropod Swarm. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we get a brief intermission to see who can read! Well, it seems like our gamerunner u/Lunarneedle can’t, and Vercigetorix flunked out of 9th grade despite not being a dead civ. Wilhelm and Thanadelthur, both rumps, sit at 78 and 77 respectively. Seeing the tech numbers, its highly likely we’ll be capping out on tech in a couple of episodes. </p>"

He’s down to his last 2 cities, and the Soviets aren’t slowing down. Something has to give, but the voice refuses to let him give anything. Lenin wouldn’t accept any offer.

As chief of the armed forces, the situation looks dire. The German army is decimated, and the Soviets are approaching from all angles. There may be no other choice but to plan for a final evacuation.

Tricamarum, Tecape and Cartenna are all in grave danger of falling to the Marajoara. And their forces have been somewhat hamstrung by the failed operation. Now, this madness may lead to chaos in the Vandal Imperium!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hadrumetum and Stuttgart both fall simultaneously, bringing an end to the German Reich. In spite of the demands of the voices in his head, Wilhelm refuses to take the coward's way out, instead escaping from Hadrumetum via U-Boat to live the rest of his life in peace somewhere distinctly less red. He takes one last glance as what remains of his empire smolders away, the bastard William the Conqueror due to become the leader of the puppet state in its remains. He moves back in as the U-Boat submerges. Its going to be a rocky ride. </p><p></p><p>Wilhelm came into the BR with lofty expectations. He was touted as an aggressive AI who would build and settle competently. The latter 2 things came true but the former… is far more up for debate. On one hand, they did undergo some pretty aggressive stances. They helped bring the ruin of Sweden early in Cycle 1, and scrapped a lot with Kosovo, the Gauls and the Two Sicilies, famously rumping the former in the very last part and eventually taking North Italy from the latter. On the other hand, if something epitomizes Germany this round, it's missed chances. They could’ve become an undisputed superpower had they bothered to actually invade the Gauls in the middle of either cycle. They could’ve chosen to ignore the 2 Sicilies instead of wasting the entire cycle in pyrrhic victories in North Italy. They could’ve probably invaded the Soviet Union and taken a few cities in Cycle 1. They should’ve probably done something with Finland, though in fairness they were so quiet literally everyone forgot they existed. It was a wild ride in the Wilhelm Wheel, and its probably pretty frustrating. And eventually, Wilhelms aggression and that frustration caught up with him, leading to the denouncements that caused his doom, while somehow their eternal rivals the Gauls managed to outlive them by practicing Finn-Jitsu. Germany is out in 12th place. F. </p>"

Immediately sensing a good opportunity, William Barak and Moshoeshoe team up to take down Punjab! We take a look at one of the primary fronts - the Arabian peninsula.

Meanwhile, we get reminded of the existence of Hazara, and its importance to the war. It serves as a forward base for potential Basotho assaults, Terengganu already in the red and primed for capture, but the Punjabis know and have sent a force to dispatch the town. </p>"

Having completely subsumed Germany, Lenin has made his mark as the strongest power in Europe, slowly building his fort up to a high power level.

  narration: "<p>And for our last slide, we get a cleaner look at the newly consolidated Marajoara Empire. The east is looking distinctly earthy, and that spreads across the deep south and all of Mexico as well. We see glimpses at the juggernaut of the Marajoara war machine, with the vast garrisons across the country. And we also spy the pitiful segmented corpse of the Rio Grande and Dene reservation up in the north. The band OutKast has started making waves there, daring to go against the sacred theocracy by pushing funky beats about isolation and expulsion. We also get a glimpse at the Chukchi lands. Interestingly, at first glance it looks like they are rather empty in America. Is their power over concentrated on the Ice Sheet Fleet? </p>"

In terms of city numbers, the Chukchi, Marajoara and Soviets establish themselves as the top 3 with 68, 56 and 28 cities respectively! The next 4 powers hover around 20, before a steep decline into All-Russia with 10, and then an even steeper one into the bottom 3 with Rio Grande’s 4, Dene’s 2 and the Gaelo-Finnic settlement of Turku. And yes, we can indeed confirm that the Germans and Malaccans are dead. </p>"
