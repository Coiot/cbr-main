  narration: "<p>And here’s something new: Governments! These are part of Rise to Power and were originally meant to be part of cycle one, but were cut due to an accident. This early on there isn’t much to say- most civs are still tribes- but there’s a few standouts. Northern Yuan bow before their new Queen, Mandhukhai, while the Nigerians, in a more democratic vein, have formed a republic and elected Awolowo to be their lawspeaker.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Marajoara have also formed a monarchy, but P’kuee seems to be more a queen of the people, compared to Northern Yuan where the nobility hold sway. Mansur Shah, sick of his old Idol lifestyle, has taken to the nomadic life as he leads the Malaccans north into China. However he’ll have to contend with the burgeoning might of the Kulin republic, lead by firebrand William barak and his populist government.</p>"

The Kingdom of Chukchi is led by their stern but fair King Lawtiliwadlin, revered by the common folk for treating them with respect and benevolence.Chola meanwhile is a much smaller Kingdom, where the constant onslaught from the Punjabi Tribe has blurred the lines between noble and common.</p><p></p><p>Goat: </p><p>Aboard the sub the small factions of exiled former tsars, god-empresses, kings and so forth ultimately pledged their united loyalty to Chieftain Nebuchadnezzar II.

Rugova folds his arms and smirks, for he had an ace up his sleeve: Gjilani. Kolchak, having heard tales of this metropolis, hastens to throw his support behind Kosovo.Also if you’re wondering why the cylinder is suddenly Mexican, it’s a feature of RtP that tints the screen in golden ages.</p>"

  narration: "<p>When it came to navies, Kulin’s got the quantity, and Malacca’s got the quality, but truth be told neither was really worth shit. Despite being far outnumbered, the crew of the Carrack guarding the Java sea are holding the line against the Kulin navy. Barak frowns from his vantage point in Marpeang Balug, and sends word to his shipyards to kick up trireme production. Malacca is absolutely huge for some reason. As far as we know it’s something to do with the food bonuses scaling a bit funny for some civs - so yeah, sorry Orange, Malacca isn’t the only one with the buff.</p>"

Mobutu is actually pushing on Hlotse! “We’ll have those idiots carved up in no time!” says Moshoshoe.

The Dene build their cities to last, however, and the presence of 2 rivers between him and the blue and green insult prevents Rosillo from making any headway. “You gotta like, just clear your chakras man!” says Tsouharissen, who’d gotten into a lot of new age stuff while in the afterlife</p>"

  narration: "<p>Mandukhai certainly has the catapults to take cities but so far is only using them to lead the line against the Heavenly warrior bands. Forests, hills and archers make for a tough enough approach to Tianjing but Best Yuan may be making things harder on themselves by splitting focus between multiple targets. </p><p></p><p>Goat: </p><p>NY did well to plant a couple new cities to the east at the end of last episode, blocking Taiping from heading north and maybe making Chukchi think twice about extending further into Asia when all of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest are sitting open in North America. </p>"

Rumour has it an unknown man pushed past Mannerheim in the pregame planning room and beamed down to the cylinder before anyone could stop him. Apparently he was bald and had thick rimmed glasses.</p>"

The Germans were already fortifying on the other side in their new settlement of Cologne. </p><p>Lenin himself seems to be doing a fine job of building up a core, settling cities in all directions to fill the newfound space. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Hello observers, due to scheduling issues a bunch of the upcoming narrators have banded together and are going to be narrating the rest of the episode. One of those are myself, Rosay. For some background, I discovered CBR all the way back in Mark 2 in highschool, and have been fortunate enough to become one of the power-rankers, and now I am lucky enough to narrate a big chunk of this episode, along with discord user GoatontheMountain, who helped narrate a bunch of my slides and may others, and one more person who i’ll let introduce himself later. This is my first time narrating so please be gentle, but please point out anything I missed in the comments. With that out of the way lets get back to the slides. </p><p></p><p>The next set of slides are displaying which civs have successfully rushed the early game wonders, right now we have Malacca, Punjab, and Nigeria all securing three wonders, followed by The Soviets, Chukchi, Rio Grande, and Kulin…</p>"

  narration: "<p>Scrolling over to a quick look at the PARG carpet lookin pretty damn thicc ngl, so thicc that Northern Yuan surrendered in fear. Western china and siberia are also still up for grabs too, with PARG looking like the most likely taker of both. Also while Uzbekistan does look decently defended for its size, Parg has plenty of catapults which may result in an early elimination if they close in on the city. It is important to note that PARG was heavily nerfed when going into endgame, and we may be about to see why two giant swaths of land are in their control.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ok so at first i thought Chukchi pulled an AI moment and settled far too far away from their core, but then i looked further and saw that they just successfully sniped mount fuji. There is also another settler on the outskirts of northern Japan which can just settle the north anyway and get those sweet sweet luxuries.</p><p></p><p>Goat: </p><p>Best Yuan appears to have designs on the former best Korea. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Nigeria and Zarie have somehow made peace with both in worse positions than they began. The Nigerian carpet is looking even more scarce, now featuring vandal troops literally between the Nigerian cities of Kano and Abuja. Meanwhile Zaire has lost any expansion hopes with Lesotho successfully stabilizing basically all of south africa. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Across the pond, Rio Grande continues to assault Echaot’l Koe with a barrage of units, which may successfully take the overextended city, but I honestly don’t see the assault going much further than there. Also, Chola built the oracle. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Northern Yuan has sent a massive force to take Tianging early, though it is quite frankly futile due to the famous “no melee unit” problem. Well yes there are technically melee units but the majority of them are likely to die before reaching the city because of terrain limitations. </p><p></p><p>Goat: </p><p>Ordos is settled and Queen Mandukhai and King Lawtiliwadlin look ready to extend their border further. Whether it’s love or rivalry between them remains to be seen. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara has not only settled two more cities, but they have also somehow managed to fit all of China into one city, especially impressive considering a one person city in civ is roughly equal to a population of a thousand. In serious terms though, Marajoara’s capital nears 30, which is especially impressive considering that were still in the Classical Era</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>By comparison Kulin has multiple cities around 8 population, which is usually a bad strategy competitively because of happiness issues and the fact that you just can't get the fancy new buildings fast. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Northern Yuan has made peace with Uzbekistan as it decides that it may be a bad idea to settle western China with a quagmire directly west of that. The new city is named Hothot, which ranks up there in the funny names rankings (though nothing will ever beat owo)</p><p></p><p>N. Yuan has yet another settler out to the west here and looks to be playing a wider game than we saw from them last go around. </p>"

  scene_title: "Not so Great Wall"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>So for some unknown reason, Chukchi has built the great wall to protect their peninsula of a capital, which covers a grand total of one city. The only reason to build a great wall would be to play keepaway, but even then Chukchi isn't exactly near anyone’s main military force and doesn't need to expand militarily. Also they still haven't settled northern Japan what the hell. </p><p></p><p>Goat: </p><p>They do, however, begin to move further east into the west with very defensible Nasuk. That said, if they wind up defending Nasuk from the Dene it will mean something has gone very wrong and they’ll have already ceded far too much space to chieftainess of drums. </p>"

  narration: "<p>GoatontheMountain here, taking the next ten or so slides! </p><p></p><p>Malacca is raining naval hellfire down on Cholapuram, though we are continuing to run into the no melee units problem. A little persistence and a single embarked swordsman could easily mark Raja Raja as the first to depart for the golden party boat hidden in the far south. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The accolades from earlier clearly went to Mannerheim’s head as he pushes ever farther and the world unites to teach him a hard lesson. Most of those declarations aren’t particularly relevant but the hammer and sickle sure are. Was it Mikkeli that sent Lenin over the edge? Pori? Or the strange imposter in the glasses suddenly wielding Mannerheim like a marionette, dancing his merry expansionist ballet into the Soviet backyard. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Tianjing takes damage but it’s a slog and the Northern Yuan don’t look likely to break through any time soon. Hong Xiuquan’s army remains robust though all those purple composite bows could turn things quickly if used well. </p>"

  scene_title: "What Are Friends For?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mandukhai decides to open another front, though scrubbing a single unsightly smudge like Gjilani from the map hardly qualifies as a war. What’s the worst that could happen, it’s Kosovo? Ah, that’s right, that lovely UA! Lungora’s trap is sprung. </p><p></p><p>Already PARG forces flood the north to defend Rugova’s passion project on the permafrost. Shangdu could be in trouble but horses and siege equipment are not ideally suited to these great swaths of boreal forest. Mountains and lakes protect HotHotHot and the fledgling Xilinhot in the absence of garrisons. </p>"

  scene_title: "Maybe I Need Better Friends"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>PARG also springs to Kosovo’s defense in the south but this time it’s purely a symbolic declaration of war as the notification on the sidebar is the only blip of All-Russian white and blue on the screen. Genseric’s trihemiolia UU isn’t super strong (it’s a trireme replacement) and Peje only has one tile of coast but Ibrahim can’t be feeling good about this one. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Rio has brought Echaot’l Koe into teh red and while no one is in place to take it next turn those bows should have no trouble keeping the defenses knocked down and the Rosillo’s swords can easily reach the city before Thandelthur’s reinforcements. </p>"

  scene_title: "Nizhniy Novgrorod and the Neglected Navy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Mikkeli is in trouble but the real story here is the Soviet naval domination! Every one of those boats launched from Nizhniy and the Gulfs of Finland and Bothnia are both firmly in Lenin’s hands with no hope of salvation. Even if Germany gave Finland open borders these cities will be lost long before Viipuri and Porvoo could build a meaningful fleet. Pitiful defense values on these Finnish cities is not helping matters. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Lesotho/Zaire war continues to grind on with no breakthroughs. Moshoeshoe has a good idea with a settler on lush Madagascar but if that unescorted band out of Mohale’s Hoek is sailing for the Horn of Africa we could see a repeate of Hlotse very quickly. </p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Tampering with Tampere"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>Unsurprisingly Mikkeli falls (privately Lenin thinks of it as St. Petersburg, though he can’t for the life of him say why), though the number of swordsmen who apparently died in the process at least deserves mention. Similarly, half the Soviet fleet is gone and Tampere hangs on just below half health. These Finnish folk don’t go down easily…but so long as Lenin is serious about this war they will go down nevertheless. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Cholapuram sinks slightly deeper into the yellow as the Malaccan fleet swells. Wasn’t there a war with the Kulin just off screen? Is Lawspeaker Barak so ineffectual that Warlord Shah can ignore him completely? </p><p></p><p>Raja Raja does have an escape plan in place now with Pazhaiyarai but the new city is even more exposed to naval invasion than his capital. </p><p></p><p>Also, I believe Chola are still at war with Punjab, though I’d forgotten until I saw that injured sword at the capital’s gates. If so things are far more grim than I had realized. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Care analysis reveals Zaire managed to push the battle lines precisely one tile south as the meat ground on. Mightily intimidated, Moshoeshoe agrees to peace before things get any worse. </p><p></p><p>The war may be over but Lesotho’s settlers still opt for the Seychelles over Somalia, and can you blame them? </p><p></p><p>Back to you, Rosay!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Thank you, Goat! Going back to Chola and it seems that it’s going to come down to the wire in Cholapuram. Malacca finally remembered that swordsmen were a thing and is now sending their men to take the city before Punjab gets it. Punjab is cutting it close with only two places to melee attack the city from, one currently being blocked by a composite, taking up that precious movement space. Pazhaiyarai is looking like fresh prey too, taking damage with a balanced unit composition nearby</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode23-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Soviets continue their attack on Kosovo, to minimal success. It appears that Kosovo has embraced the turtle style of army build, as they have an almost entirely ranged defense force. I'd say that there’s a small chance that Prizreni falls just by attrition, but all of the units traveling across the sea are unfortunately destined to seek a watery grave.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh, right, the game–and would you look at that, Cholapurma has fallen to Punjab, Malacca was only one turn away from taking the city too, that’s unfortunate. Pazhaiyarai seems to have taken almost no damage, as a matter of fact it has actually healed since the last time we saw it. I’m pretty sure Punjab’s unit composition just got worse too and.. oh no we’re gonna have another rump aren't we.</p>"

  narration: "<p>You know if it weren't for Tampere being in the red, I'm pretty sure it’d be impossible to tell a war was still going on here. Heck there's even a peaceful prayer circle on the borders of a war in Minsk. The Soviets really seem to only be sending triremes over the Baltics, and while that's going to succeed for Tampere, the rest of Finland should probably be fine. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Few things to mark down here: First, Gauls have finally gotten into Britain. That's going to be a good expansion opportunity. Second, Germany looks to settle the Upper Isles which sort of invalidates the Gallic expansion. Third, both Gauls and Germany have massive carpets and we may see a meat grinder. Fourth, italy is looking pretty exposed and we may see the Vandals kicked out of Europe before they even began. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Kosovo continues to successfully fend off the Soviets in what I can only describe as an Anatolian Winter War. Prizreni is faring a bit better than previously and is probably going to survive the Soviet Onslaught. The Vandals approach Peje in hopes of doing a bit better, and they do appear to have access to Nigerian waters, providing a bit more landing ground. In Central Asia the Soviets settle Voronezh which is more or less destined to be slaughtered by Uzbekistan.</p>"

Tampere has been secured with more boats in the Baltics to take back the city. This is looking to be one of those cities that flips infinitely as the Soviets will retake the city by sea after the Finns take it by land, entering a quantum state Finnish-Soviet limbo. </p>"

I know I've criticized many civs for running into the “no melee units” problem but it appears the opposite might be the case here, as Northern Yuan’s core is almost exclusively melee Units. This makes it hard for civs to safely accumulate damage on a city without losing units in a meat grinder, though it is a little better than the “no melee unit” alternative.

In this slide, they are embarking most of their army in what appears to be an invasion force of the NN city of Michilimackinac. Being so isolated, Marajoara is able to dedicate so much of their army to one task because they don’t yet have any threat of invasion on their home continent.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kulin and Malacca reignite their war, with Kulin troops moving towards the Malaccan cities in Indonesia. Kulin does not have a major naval presence in this part of the ocean, as compared to Malacca who already has their unique caravel replacement, the Jong, along with galleases. If Malacca moves their navy over to the east in response to this war, it very well could be Kulin that loses this war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Neutral Nation keeps going back and forth on whether or not to burn the traitors, and eventually decide to burn them, with their razing of Liidli Kue. The razing of the city will not negatively impact them too much, as they will likely just re-settle another city where that one was razed, as there are no other civs who can contest that settle spot.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The end of this episode brings us some of the religious statistics of the world. Most notably we see Nigeria at the top in both cities following their religion and number of followers. It seems like Taiping and Uzbekistan founding a religion didn’t help them much this game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We finish this episode with a religion map of the world, showing the dominance of different religions around the map. Fitting that the mapmaker’s last slide is of a map, though I personally prefer my own! It’s been a great honor to be able to narrate a portion of this episode, and I hope that I was able to narrate this episode to elevate its best moments to greater heights. Keep an eye out for this episode’s map, coming to a subreddit near you!</p>"
