  narration: "<p>Hello and welcome to episode 17. I am Random Strategy, you may know me as the keeper of the stats page (whose quality has admittedly lessened as of late) or as the official *best* power ranker according to the Vihreaan metric. Last episode saw the elimination of Uzbekistan, the rumpification of Finland and Malacca expanding into the Indian Ocean using the power of Jong. Many more exciting events lie in wait ahead, so let's get going.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Civ is fun when it's just a game and the only people harmed are virtual. It's distressing when scenarios from civ games start occuring in real life. Real life should not resemble a civ game. The rest of this narration was written before the invasion of Ukraine started, so I'm just using this space to express my support for the people of Ukraine and to denounce Putin for bringing war back to Europe and for threatening the world with nuclear war.</p><p></p>"

  scene_title: "Chukchi number 1"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season2-pr26-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi retain the first place in the power rankings, due mostly to having vastly more cities and production than anyone else on the cylinder. </p>"

  scene_title: "The “democratic republic” of Nigeria"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-06.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see that more and more nations are becoming republics, with the 2 latest additions being the Neutral Confederacy and the Marajoaran League. Monarchy still remains a strong second choice.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, despite becoming the world’s first autocratic nation last episode, Nigeria also remains a republic. I don’t know what the trigger is that makes a civ change government, but it appears picking an ideology isn’t one of them. </p><p></p><p>One last point I would like to make is to look at Punjab, whom I was very impressed by in cycle 1 for their rather unique strategy of opening piety first and making it look strong: usually a piety first opening is a recipe for an israel-style instant rump, but Punjab found a way to make it work, and it worked well. This time around they have repeated the exact same strategy of opening piety first and thus have become a theocratic state, ruled over by priests.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Bureaucratic Provisional All-Russian Empire"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Perhaps thinking of cosying up to Malacca against the Chukchi, the Dene imitate them in becoming a merchant league. It also seems there is a mass migration of Gauls heading northwards to safer lands to escape the Vandals. Finally, in the wake of Uzbekistan’s death by Punjab, the wandering Uzbek Great Prophet has anointed Kolchak as Emperor of All-Russia. </p>"

  scene_title: "South America is FINALLY interesting"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-08.jpg
  narration: "<p>We start the episode off with a new war:, Rio Grande and the Vandals team up against Marajoara. Marajoara are currently science-turtling down in South America, so slowing them down now while their tech lead isn’t too bad is a good call for both nations. Marajoara have apparently not been using their high science on naval techs: they appear to still be on exploration tech with their UU snake canoe galleas replacement out, so they should be pretty beateable, if not by Rio (who also have bad naval tech), then at least by the Vandals. OK, I will admit being on exploration tech with a UU out is exactly the same as Malacca’s situation right now, but you need to realize that the snake canoe is not a jong, so don’t expect Marajoara to achieve the same results as Malacca.</p>"

  scene_title: "South Atlantic Squirmishes"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-09.jpg
  narration: "<p>And indeed, the Vandals fleet is more technologically advanced than Marajoara’s, fielding frigates and privateers which normally dominate the sea at this stage of the game. The only problem here is they are keeping most of it at home and the few that are crossing the Atlantic are very scattered. I also notice as musician has also boarded a frigate going into battle, to sing inspiring songs for the crew.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Nigerian fleet have successfully captured Thaba Tseka from Lesotho, and are now moving in on Butha-Buthe. The battle on land, meanwhile, appears to be fairly stale-matey due to the jungle cover.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Now I have a jong too"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-11.jpg
  narration: "<p>Malacca captures Rawalpindi and Nar Nar Goon in what I think is the 4th? war between the two that started at the end of last episode. The Kulin has frigates which, as I mentioned 2 slides ago, would ordinarily win a war of this type. However, the Kulin also had frigates last war and Malacca still won anyway because apparently jongs are apparently just that good. Faced with such an OP unit, Barak has deployed privateers with the aim of stealing and using the jongs for himself. They have already captured one of them.</p>"

- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Horsemen? really?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Germany has a (near-)full carpet. There’s just one problem: horsemen are a classical era unit: all they would do in a war would be to blindly charge at the first enemy and die doing minimal damage. Meanwhile the Vandals seem to be struggling with the concept of inland cities: Bibracte is protected from any attack from the sea by hills, which means the vandals have got to bring in their own siege equipment and melee troops. So far they have brought in… 1 cuirassier.</p>"

  scene_title: "Colony vs colony"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Marajoara have sent a small expedition of galleons to try and capture Andachkhrob, but the fleet has unfortunately been blocked by Gaulish borders. However, they do find a vandal frigate newly constructed in Hadrumetum so they decide to kill it instead. The Gaulish colonies here are also trying to capture Hadrumetum though without much success. To the far left the Dene are having happiness problems.</p>"

  scene_title: "Wilhelm, class dunce"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see that Germany, on top of having an outdated military, also has everything else outdated. They’re behind even the Gauls in tech! This is going to be a serious problem if they don’t fix it soon!</p>"

  scene_title: "Bottom in tech"

  scene_title: "It’s time for round 2!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-21.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s time for round 2! The Chukchi have prepared an enormous invasion force to take on Northern Yuan. The last war went extremely well for the Chukchi, as can be seen clearly by the entire Chukchi side of the border being ex-Yuanish cities. They are evidently looking to replicate that success a second time. Joining them is Punjab, who will have a difficult trek through mountains to reach the front lines but should still be helpful.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lesotho have recaptured Thaba Tseka, though it looks like it will continue to flip. The Nigerian fleet that had originally captured it are down to their last boat having only taken a sliver of health from Butha-Buthe.</p><p></p><p>The Kulin explorers on this slide also appear to have lied and falsely reported back that there was settleable land in africa, because why else would a Kulin settler follow them here?</p>"

  scene_title: "Comrade Pküee"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-24.jpg
  narration: "<p>And here is the news that Marajoara is second to an ideology. Rather than follow Nigeria in getting autocracy, something which would give them immediate military benefits in this war, Marajoara have chosen order for its science benefits to large empires. At least 1 person is unhappy enough with these new developments that they have grabbed a spear outside Ilha os Marcos. </p>"

  scene_title: "Trio down to Duo"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-25.jpg

  scene_title: "Blue Indonesia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-26.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, on the main front of the war, Malacca have captured Woori Yallock. The Kulin frigates are resisting as best they can but there are just SO many jongs. They are cheaper than regular boats so Malacca can just spam them out and create a veritable swarm.Oh and the west Malaccan jong fleet appears to have arrived too, back from bullying Lesothan and Nigerian islands.</p>"

  scene_title: "Finland is Bosnia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-27.jpg
  narration: "<p>After a soviet citadel, Finland only have a single tile corridor to reach the sea. They are almost an enclave of the soviets. Their best hope is to be the new Tibet, who survive through protection from the larger civ.</p>"

  scene_title: "Attacking a retirement home is just cruel"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-28.jpg
  narration: "<p>While the Malacca/Kulin war rages on at the bottom of the image, the Chukchi attack the small isolated Northern Yuan colony of Avarga. Usually you would build a colony like this to act as your retirement home once the rest of your civilization has been conquered. However, Northern Yuan will not have that luxury. They do manage to barter a peace with the neutrals, but somehow I don’t think the neutrals have enough influence to make civs follow their lead.</p>"

  scene_title: "Skirmish in the jungle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-29.jpg
  narration: "<p>Thaba Tseka has flipped back to Nigeria and it looks like Nigeria is also slowly winning the ground war ever so slightly: the front line looks to have moved about 1 tile south since the start of the war. However Lesotho’s brand new enlightenment era units have just reached the front line, so the situation might reverse again.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Frigates are what’s needed"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-30.jpg
  narration: "<p>The snake canoes are attacking Onguiaahra. However, the greenland Marajaoaran galleon expedition we saw earlier is getting shredded by vandal reinforcements. The Dene are making sure to protect their colony of Ounonisaton with a good up-to-date navy: the plan will no doubt be to connect it to the core at some point.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "The pale horde"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The massive Chukchi horde has crashed into Northern Yuan like a wave and have got Bayan Tumen down to the yellow. The war is being fought with equal units: crossbows, muskets and cannons vs crossbows, muskets and cannons, the difference is that the Chukchi have so many more of them.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Peace in russia"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-32.jpg
  narration: "<p>The 2 Russias put aside their differences for the time being. The war was going nowhere what with the Urals in the way. PARG was the overall winner with the capture of Smolensk and Krasnodar.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "How are there so many jongs?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-33.jpg
  narration: "<p>A privateer has managed to take back Nar Nar Goon. However, Malacca just has more and more jongs; those units are just way too cheap to build. However, the Kulin are making the mistake of embarking their crossbows: against jongs, it appears that the only thing you can do is stay on land where they can’t reach you. And a line of crossbows on the shore would be very useful at thinning out the swarm.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Dene core"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-34.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Dene have frigates before the Chukchi, which means they should be safe on that front for the time being. They have a pretty good core though I’d rather they have a few more musketmen standing in front of Deline and Dettah in case of a surprise Rio attack. </p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Pacific weeds"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the array of various pacific island colonies. In cycle 1 the Kulin spent a large portion of the game cleaning them all up, only to have more spring up as soon as one was razed. This time around the Kulin are rather too occupied with Malacca to uproot these weeds growing in their backyard.</p>"

  scene_title: "How many frigates does it take to clear out a jong infestation?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-36.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nar Nar Goon has flipped again. However, Malacca’s indian ocean fleet does appear to have been destroyed at last. All that remains are 2 jongs attacking Eumemmerring and its 2 defensive frigates.</p>"

  scene_title: "Forward march"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-37.jpg

  scene_title: "Blitzing through"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-38.jpg
  narration: "<p>And just like that, Bayan Tumen falls and Yingchang is already in the red. The Chukchi war machine is showing no signs of stopping.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Siege of Kinshasa"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-39.jpg
  narration: "<p>It turns out fancy new enlightenment era units were not enough to turn the tide, as Nigerian ground forces have moved south far enough to start besieging Kinshasa. The cores of both civs appear to be very thin: now it’s a battle of production.</p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "Punjab core"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-40.jpg
  narration: "<p>Punjab is struggling to get through the Himalayas to reach Northern Yuan. They do have a decent army, the issue is getting it somewhere useful. I would normally say that if they could upgrade their navy from galleases to frigates they would have a chance at retaking the Chola lands but, as the Kulin show, jongs are apparently better than even frigates through sheer numbers. Also PARG is evidently unhappy at Punjab getting the elimination on Uzbekistan and getting to keep their cities. They have spammed citadels all the way from Voronezh to Samarkand.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-42.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vandals have finally captured Matinados, and immediately set it to flame. Marajoara does have a settler ready to immediately resettle it it.I can’t help but be reminded how in cycle 1, the Vandals captured the Palmares capital on this exact spot.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Fortress Bibracte"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-43.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vandals have also finally worked out they need ground forces to attack Bibracte. However, now they face a different problem: Bibracte has 60 defense: the units they have can’t deal enough damage to bring it down! I don’t know how the Gauls got to be this good at turtling, all I can say is that it’s doing a great job at keeping them alive for the time being.</p>"
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: "2 wars end and 2 more begin"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-44.jpg
  narration: "<p>Apparently there were even more jongs in the indian ocean as they have just arrived to start harassing Australia’s southern cities. Before they can do anything, peace is declared. Australia lost all their Indonesian holdings this time round, though the mainland is still safe. In total it’s +2 cities for Malacca overall.</p><p></p><p>In the sidebar we see the reason why peace happened this turn: the Kulin have agreed to help the Vandals in taking down top tech dog Nigeria. This is a very good idea seeing as Nigeria is currently slowly beating Lesotho and if they succeed in that conquest, then they would become unstoppable. And what’s more Nigerian troops are exhausted from long years of fighting. Lesotho itself is just glad for the reprieve and leaves to recover.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-45.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Chukchi have captured Northern Yuan’s planned retirement home and burnt it to the ground in a show of spite. We also see that Malacca never bothered trying to get Kei’YerGyn back and the frigate privateer duo are still hanging out there.</p>"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: "Front lines of Vandals vs Nigeria"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-46.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we are at the front lines of the Vandal/Nigeria war and I can immediately see a problem. The Vandals forgot to bring ground forces. Sure, their Mediterranean navy looks pretty scary, even including the cylinder’s first cruisers but the only city they can attack is Port Harcourt. Meanwhile Nigeria can use their ground forces to attack the entire southern half of the Vandals. </p><p></p><p>A lone Nigerian surveyor uses the war as an opportunity to make a bold expedition into the heart of Vandal territory. In the desert of north africa, he will discover the tomb of a certain Abdelkader, containing many relics which he plunders. They will come in helpful in about 13 turns….</p>"

  narration: "<p>Marajoara has recaptured Matinados, though there are still a few Vandal ships lying in wait to re-recapture. The Vandals splitting their atlantic navy by attacking two civs at once is a pretty bad move - it would have been better to peace out with Marajoara so that the ships currently fighting Marajoara could be reassigned to fighting the Nigerian fleet. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-48.jpg
  narration: "<p>Vandal dominance over the Atlantic is so strong that even the two small Antarctic colonies of Zama Regia and Thapsus were able to capture and burn Benin City from Marajoara right under their nose. I’m guessing they will try to capture Ilorin next.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-52.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we get to see that Lesotho ended the war with Thaba Tseka, which means the war was a draw. A small Nigerian expedition of 3 galleons heads south to try and capture Thagaste. Nigeria does have very little navy remaining, so should be thankful that the scary Vandal navy is too stupid to path over here.</p>"

Northern Yuan’s army concentrated in two pieces around Erdene Zuu to the south and Gjilani in the north, but there’s nothing in the middle to defend the capital! It was all taken out by the Chukchi’s initial blitz! </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrz-season2-episode27-56.jpg
  narration: "<p>And Nigeria is the one who scores first blood against the vandals with the capture of Cirta. The Vandal conquest of Port Harcourt was delayed by the arrival of Nigeria’s red sea fleet, who then actually used the canal to enter the mediterranean. However, all this means is that the Vandal navy can start actually fighting instead of sitting there being useless. And we also see a small detachment of Nigerian cuirassiers flanking round the side to go attack Peje.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Marajoara seem to be putting a lot of effort into capturing Jimenez, the only spot of South America they don’t own… (well that and Matinados which has also just flipped again). Unfortunately the Andes protect it from attacks by land. As for attacks by sea, Rio’s Pacific navy is so far successfully holding off anything Marajoara sends at it, and I’m pretty sure that Marajoara’s Pacific navy is getting killed by the Vandal colonies of Thenae and Tripolis anyway.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Chukchi have delayed the siege of Karakorum to first grab the Taiping capital of Tianjing. In the sidebar we see two wonders. Nigeria has built the Crystal Palace, an enlightenment era wonder that gives a bonus to great people based on great works, as well as having 3 great work slots of its own. This is quite useful to Nigeria’s strategy of simply dominating the culture and science game. The Vandals on the other hand have built the Kronborg, which provides25 hp in all coastal cities and +50% production for naval units in the city it was built.This also fits quite nicely into their boat-based strategy, and is particularly useful with Nigeria sieging a few of their coastal cities right now.</p>"

I must say the defenders of that city did a much better job than the defenders further south. Gjilani started the war as a puppet on the front lines and it took until now for it to fall. In that time the Chukchi had time to capture Karakorum even though it had to get through Bayan Tumen and Yingchang to reach it, all 3 of which were core cities, which therefore should have been better defended than some puppet.</p>"

The naval core is indeed filled with frigates and ships of the line, powerful enlightenment-era units that should be able to win most wars of this era. Much better than the horrendously outdated horsemen that occupy the land core (and greenland) .

Not ones to question the wisdom of the ancients, Nigeria immediately promoted every single sailor of their small navy to admiral. </p><p></p><p>In case you’re wondering about the real explanation of how did Nigeria get so many admirals in 1 turn: it’s an RtP bug and it will be fixed by next episode; the great admirals will also be deleted.</p>"

So the end result is Rio up 1 city and the Vandals up 2 cities. While Marajoara certainly lost this war, they didn’t take much damage: they are still first in science and will soon overtake Nigeria in overall tech, so the science turtle strategy is still going fine.

  narration: "<p>But they won’t get it. The Chukchi eliminate Northern Yuan in 17th place. Total gains: Punjab 1, PARG 3, Chukchi 7.</p><p></p><p>Northern Yuan were actually ranked 1st before the game started, due to their spacious siberian start. While they did successfully settle their space, they always had one very major problem throughout their existence: tech. Northern Yuan spent the entire of cycle 1 seriously behind in the science game. They were dead last to ideology by a long shot (excluding rumps and civs that were already dead) and this lack of key techs such as industrialisation also hurt their production. Later on, they would stop researching techs altogether and ended cycle 1 still on atomic-era/early information-era units. This made wars very difficult. Southern Yuan was one of the only nations with worse tech than them so that’s where they ended up conquering, though it was a slow and difficult process: Northern Yuan’s usual tactics involve spamming so many citadels that the opponent has no land left to store troops. They were also able to pick up some inland Japanese colonies. Their relationship with PARG was strained: PARG even captured Karakorum for a while, though Northern Yuan was eventually able to push them all the way back when PARG started having economic difficulties of their own. In total war they again used their citadel spam tactic against Taiping, but got utterly demolished by Malacca, saved from elimination only by the bell. One civ that had curiously never troubled Northern Yuan in cycle 1 was the Chukchi, and this was pretty lucky as the Chukchi could have stomped them. In cycle 2, this is exactly what we saw: despite no longer having all the advantages of future worlds tech, over the course of 2 wars the Chukchi just came in and blitzed through the entirety of Northern Yuan extremely fast and efficiently. I’m not sad to see them go. Failing to research any tech at all is one of the worst mistakes you can make in civ, one that should end with you getting utterly demolished by anyone remotely competent. The demolition by Malacca in cycle 1 was frustratingly cut short so I am happy to see it happen again, except this time by the Chukchi.</p>"
