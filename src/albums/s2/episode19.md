  narration: "<p>Hello everybody. Msurdej here, and I’ll be your guide to this week’s episode of the Civ Battle Royale. I’ve been a Power Ranker for several years now (starting all the way back in Mk2), and have narrated several parts as well. I’ve been lucky to get some eliminations in my two prior parts, and am hoping to go 3 for 3. Considering how bloody the cylinder’s been though, I like my odds.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As it turns out, we won’t have to wait long. Marajoara easily take the last two cities of Paraguay, knocking them out at 39th place.Oh Paraguay, you wanted so much to be like your big brother Uruguay. But sadly, you lacked the skills, drive and AI to make a big difference. You mostly just sat around the bottom of the upper half of the curve. It looked promising when Solano attacked Marajoara, but it the end, the power of P’kuee proved too much for Paraguay.F</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back in North America, the Dene are bombing Clatsop. While the city is in red, it will be safe for now, as the peacekeepers will prevent Dene forces from getting near the city.

Despite everything, the city of Pangan has a staggering 91 population, which is even more than the Burkina Faso megacity of Ubari. How Barghash has managed this, I do not know.

With the Punjab to the west, and the Taiping to the east, the number two civ  has no shortage of civs looking to take clay from them.

Between Nigeria, Zaire, Kurdistan, Two Sicilies, and Kosovo, the map of the Middle East looks as mangled as a regular map of the Middle East.Speaking of Kosovo, they have done fairly well for themselves.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode19-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>After last part’s humiliating defeat to the Northern Yuan, Punjab decides to take a shot at Kolchak. Bhera is a sore spot on the map, an exclave that is lightly defended and out of the way. Capturing it should be an easy feat for the PARG, with their tanks and bombers and PARGchamps. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Dene finally have a solid way into Northern Yuanmerica, and manage to capture Clatsop. But the forces of Northern Yuan are still numerous, making a flip a possibility.

  narration: "<p>In a shocking turn of events, Punjab  has managed to blitz the city of Chelyabinsk. The few Punjab troops went on the offensive, and have certainly taken Kolchak by surprise. All in all, things aren’t going PARGchamp for PARG.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well folks, prime your F keys. Uzbekistan has had enough of Cleopatra, and is deciding to put her out of her misery. Already Medina is down to half health, and Uzbek forces  are primed to invade. Short of massive foreign intervention or some amazing moves by the Kulin peacekeepers, the Pteolemies may not be long for this cylinder.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, we have a much nicer scene, down here in Hawa’iindoneaisa. Sure, it may be a carpet of outdated ships and rifles. Sure, it can probably be crushed by either the Kulin or Malacca in a matter of turns. But for what it is, at this point in the game, it's the best Lili'uokalani can hope for.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kolchak may have managed to retake Chelyabinsk, but the Punjab strike team simply respond by taking Kansk. Kolchak has a tank battalion encircling the city, but Ranjit Singh is reinforcing Bhera with more paratroopers. Paratroopers that can keep pestering PARG throughout this war. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Somewhere in the world,the Vandals build a new marvelous wonder: The Kalt Geymsla Data Haven. This gives increased yields from Tundra and Snow tiles worked by the city by 2 Science and 2 Culture, alongside +2 Gold for each Server Hub in the empire. However, the city must be built on a Tundra. This, naturally, cuts out a lot of the Vandal cities, meaning it's probably somewhere in Vandal North America.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With relative ease, the Uzbek forces march into Medina. Cleopatra is found with an asp at her side, and the Ptolemies are eliminated in 38th place.Cleopatra did remarkably well for herself. Sure, she didn’t make a canal city on the Suez, but they did manage to carve out an empire in Africa and the Middle East. But when Nigeria and (to a lesser extent) Zaire came knocking, the empire crumbled, mostly due to being predominantly desert tiles. They spent their final days on the coast of the Red Sea, looking out over their former lands. They did better than expected, but not good enough to win.F</p>"

  narration: "<p>We take a break from the action on Turn 650 to see the top hoarders in the CBR. Leading the pack, with more than 400,000 more gold than the runner up, is Nigeria. The Vandals, USSR, and Punjab are in a much closer position to each other than the competition, so the 2nd place could change soon enough.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Another war starts, this time between Rio Grande and the Vandals. Rosillo is definitely the favored civ in this match up, thanks in large part to their futuristic army, terrain advantages, and glitched defenses.How Genseric plans  to take a city with over 600 defense, I'll never know.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we can see Rio Grande going on the offense, pushing the Vandals back into the sea. The tech difference is truly noticeable here: Rio Grande has Giant Death Robots, while the Vandals are fielding Great War Infantry. Whether that tech advantage leads to cities though, remains to be seen.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And here we can see... Hey wait a minute! Who put this United Nations session in the way of the map? While it’s important that Nigeria is trying to enact Heritage Sites and Germany wants to repeal the embargo on Germany, it's not as important as the fate of Yuanmerica.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode19-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Rio Grande has a lot of insane defenses, those defenses don’t automatically transfer over to their conquered cities.

  narration: "<p>Beverside has fallen to the Rio Grande, and multiple Vandal cities are starting to fall under attack. How long does the Vandal Coast have? As Rosillo focuses his efforts on the East coast, he also closes out a war with Great Perm, to better cut down on the war processing paperwork perhaps.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We get a shot of the PARG homeland, and see Tanks. Tanks, tanks, tanks, nothing but tanks as far as the eye can se-Breaking news! As soon as the war started, it seems The Vandals have managed to get a peace deal with the Rio Grande. How Rosillo had managed to be convinced to end a war he had the upper hand in, I’ll never know.

I think it’s Tongva time.And so does Thanadelthur, who has begun to fight Toypurina.The biggest enemy here though, is terrain, as the Rockies prevent the Dene from unleashing their full might against Tongva.

  narration: "<p>Over in this portion of India, We can see that the Punjab lands are sparsely defended. Chola has more troops in the vicinity, but if the Punjab PARG war taught us anything, it’s that Ranjit Singh can pull a lot of troops out of nowhere.</p>"
