    narration: "<p>Uhhhhhhhhhh, Genseric? You good? Did you have too much to drink there buddy? The purpose of a peace treaty in these issues is to save your empire, NOT THROW IT TO THE WOLVES YOU BUCCANEERS WANNABE.</p><p></p><p>Yep! The Vandals have just given up every single one of their remaining cities to Mara. Well, every city except Peje, which the USSR has taken.

    narration: "<p>The Soviets make peace with the Vandals, and as you can see at the bottom, Peje remains in red hands. The Vandals have officially been eliminated at 11th place (*cries*)</p><p></p><p>The Vandals are probably X2’s Merriam-Webster dictionary definition of an underdog. They were the 3rd worst civ per the Part 0 rankings, even worse than the Tuareg (remember them, neither did I MOVING ON). They did pretty decently for the first bit of the game, until they started trademaxxing, with the Vandals glitching out and receiving stupid amounts of traders. Fueled by certified drip, they became X2’s Buccaneers, settling the Caribbean and even rumping (and eventually killing) the New Netherlands. From then they would stagnate for a bit, and even lose some territory from Total War, but would still move into Cycle 2 with a good hand. They started C2 with a gamble: using their unique unit to settle undefended cities and establish a solid mediterranean core. This gambit paid off, with them trapping Nigeria and even rumping the former science giant, becoming a frontrunner yet again to win. Though it wouldn’t last, as Marajoara’s snowballing led to the Vandal’s demise. </p><p></p><p>Genseric, you may have blundered at the very end, but you come out as one of the great unexpected rulers, a true legend. Keep that chin up king, your crown is slipping.</p>"

Lenin establishes a provisional capital in Helsinki, a capital of the former empire of Finland that he himself conquered in what feels like the distant, distant past now. As Vladimir looks out on the burning fortresses in the distant, the sound of explosions littering the landscape, he thinks about if all of the other immortal leaders that he conquered himself had this revelation, that in order for their to be winners in war, there must also be losers.
