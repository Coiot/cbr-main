  narration: "<p>Greetings Babylonians! It’s Arilasqueto, aka /u/aredundantsofa, and I’ll be your captain for today’s flight. Now be sure you buckle up, cuz this one’s gonna be turbulent. Most of you probably know me from the art I’ve done around the community, such as the banner and title cards.</p><p>For those of you watching on the 14th, change your name to Brick and guillotine some aristocrats, cuz it’s both Bastille Day and International Non-Binary People’s Day! Alternatively for y’all still in the 13th, it’s… Patrick Stewart’s Birthday and the 36 year anniversary of the Wembley Live-Aid concert. Cool.</p><p>Also wanna put in a lil plug for the “Kings of the Wild Frontier” event the modding community has been working on recently, which is adding a bunch of new Native American civs. Plenty of potential candidates for next season in there as well as all-round some qt civs, if you feel like checking it out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The same civ stays in first, and it’s Malacca, a Malaysian civ! Not sure anyone could have predicted they’d rise this high given the region’s track record. While I’d definitely call them fan favourites, not everyone is entirely happy to see them up here, especially not Taiping supporters. Will they keep bearing the torch, or will another civ knock them off their pedestal to claim the crown this episode? Who can say?</p>"

  scene_title: "Fallout: New Kuravunga"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We jump straight into the action with, well, not much of it. Rosillo’s attempt to project his power into the Mojave has been a resounding failure so far. While the early battle of Chowiinga was a big boost for Rio Grande morale, since then the old jingoistic fervour has wilted a bit. Now the slog over the Rockies to the Great Basin is dreaded rather than relished.</p><p>Over in Kuravunga, a regiment of Chinook soldiers, out of work after the Chukchi campaign, have come down to sightsee. “Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter” says one of the pikemen, to which the musketman replies “what the hell is a nuclear winter?”</p><p>We can also see in the sidebar that Marajoara have adopted Autocracy (expect to see a lot of this). Clearly kicking Bolivar’s ass has inspired the people to rally around the coral flag even more than before.</p>"

  scene_title: "Prepare for trouble..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene07.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile in Africa, Mobutu goes up against Cleopatra once again, seeking to get revenge for the absolute embarrassment that happened last time. It may look weighted towards the Ptolemies at first glance, but the Zairean army is far better equipped. However, Mobutu had the advantage there last time and still had a fool made of him. It all depends whether Cleopatra has another ace up her sleeve.</p>"

  scene_title: "...And make it double"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene08.jpg
  narration: "<p>Predictably, Mobutu has brought in his old ally Awolowo in his battle against the Ptolemies, showing that friendship can still bloom between ideological opposites. Nigeria looks a lot better prepared for this war, but they lack open borders with Burkina Faso (who obviously aren’t Nigeria fans after getting btfo in episode 2). This creates a relatively small chokepoint for them to go through.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pacific Problems"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite P’kuee taking the Lion’s Share, Lautaro also signed up to the Bolivar Beatdown, and is making a token effort to assault the Galapagos. Bolivar is probably more distracted by the fact that he’s about to lose the Panama Canal, which would put all his pacific cities at the mercy of the Marajoaran Navy. In the face of that, a few Mapuche galleons is pretty insignificant. </p><p>Purea, for the time being, seems to have avoided disaster.</p>"

  scene_title: "Shivaji’s Protege"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene10.jpg
  narration: "<p>Barzani is struggling with the concept of moving his army into position. Instead he’s using the interesting tactic of slowly pinging Jerusalem to death with crossbow bolts. It doesn’t help that he has literally 2 melee units in this shot, and neither are anywhere near the front lines. Apparently Kurdish generals developed this strategy from hearing tales of a mythical civilization known as “Maratha”. </p>"

  scene_title: "Hiding in plain sight"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Genseric’s first wave of attack seems to have died back, the New Dutch are nowhere near out of the fire yet. A veritable armada of Vandalic ships has formed outside the island port of Caput Vada, and this time the ships have a land army on board. Clearly Genseric is intent on holding down his new colony.</p><p>Marajoara are also mustering a fleet in the area, as well as showcasing some new military tech. Notably, scientists have discovered a way of completely camouflaging buildings, and trialed this in the city of Matinados.</p><p>Also where the heck is that Gallic settler headed?</p>"

  scene_title: "Spain without the S"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The first German ships start to arrive in the bay of Biscay. Despite Spain’s sharp decline in recent years, their navy is still top of the range, and Carlos is confident he can drive off the invaders. The same can’t be said of Vercingetorix, who is still fielding Galleases. Or maybe oceaning would be a better word?</p>"

  scene_title: "Cuirassier conga line"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>Look, Hong, I get that you’re Jesus’ brother and everything, but you can’t work miracles, and you sure as shit need a miracle if you ever hope to make anything of this Bhutan war. Well, that or a good peace treaty. There are literally 2 tiles the Taiping army can move through, and they aren’t even next to each other.</p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Vandalism"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>Genseric probably won’t even need that Armada. The initial troops he sent over seem to have had no trouble grinding the New Dutch beneath their boots. Stuyvesant has moved back behind the safety of the Appilachians, having practically lost hope of ever retaking the eastern seaboard. On a clear day in the mountains you can see the smoke plume rising from the remains of Nieuw Amsterdam, or “Novum Amstelodamum” as the Vandals now call it.</p>"

  scene_title: "Blood in the Amur"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>It’s pretty clear that Japan isn’t retaking those cities. The republic of Osaka long prided itself with its independence from Tokyo, but when Mandukhai’s Chongzu marched into Kashiwasaki, they realised their solitude had left them no one to turn to.</p><p>And of course, we have to wonder what that Neutral warrior is doing. Just standing there… menacingly.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Cheers love, the cavalry’s here"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Awolowo’s strategy seems to just be “Horse!” and it appears to be working so far. Meanwhile to the east, the Zaire army have successfully reclaimed the outpost of Mwene Ditu, though they’re looking a little thin on the ground already with few reserves in sight. Cleopatra is also looking a bit worse for wear, given that the army she had at the start of the war appears to have been split in two by the hooves of the Nigerian cavalry.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "She sells Seychelles on the seashore"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile off the Horn of Africa, things seem to have stabilised. Mogadishu has been properly integrated as a province of Nigeria, and Hejaz have fended off the worst of their attackers for the time being. Zanzibar’s Seychelle territory is also flourishing, but under increasing risk of getting cut off from the African half by Lesotho’s nautical claims.</p><p>We have another civ adopting Autocracy. This time it’s the Two Sicilies, as the people rejoice in the strength of their navy and clamour for Ferdinand to use it.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Dancing on ice"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The once bountiful province of Markland is now a shadow of its former self, as the Icelanders lose control of Staten Eylant for likely the last time. The two remaining cities lack melee units of any description, so each city flip will be unrecoverable for Eldjarn.</p><p>Iceland is truly a sad sight to see. While once they were an up and coming underdog, now they’re a grey husk, hemorrhaging cities to their neighbours. For each city they lose in the east, they lose another in the west. Eldjarn’s Icy, he’s clean, but he’s not a bad motherfucker, he’s just bad. </p><p>Also hehehe “mound bottom”.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "I wanna Beaver very best"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>Stuyvesent’s troops have been so exhausted that even the Neutrals could have a shot at taking a few cities if they declared war. Things might be past their worst for Stuyvesent however, as the Vandals don’t seem to have much interest in the New Dutch heartlands.</p><p>I say that about Tsouharissen, but he’s currently at war with the Dene, and the army has just started trickling in. By the look of it they’ll only prove a distraction more than anything.</p><p>Also a look at the minimap shows us that Carlos stupidly gave away Barcelona to Wilhelm. So much for germans being bad at humour, cuz that peace deal’s a fucking joke.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hey mum, I’m on TV!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>And here’s a look at us, the people of the sub! So far no one appears to be aware of us, but the Malaccans, the current Blue Eyed boys, are getting fairly close. The Indian ocean became an absolute garbage patch last season, but that doesn’t seem to be happening yet.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Just touched down in Spanish Town"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>Things go from bad to worse for Bolivar, as he loses Cumana and Caracas, his second city, to Marajoara. The canal city Magangue looks to follow shortly. Frankly, nothing short of a little diplomatic wizardry is gonna save Bogota at this point, as P’kuee’s army circles in for the kill. Among the remains of the Caracas garrison, a lone musician plays an elegy to the man they once called the liberator.</p>"

  scene_title: "Nazibar"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Hejazi caravels skirmish with Punjabi galleons, as our latest Autocrats enter the scene, Zanzibar. Honestly I wouldn’t have pegged Zanzibar as the autocratic type- they strike me as the sort to go freedom- but I guess it takes all sorts.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Capsizing in the Caspian"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>So far, Georgia has done an admirable job fending off the Uzbekistani invasion, likely due to all the units needing to embark into the Caspian in order to attack. However, Tamar’s fate might be changing as Karimov sends a brigade of Cuirassiers the long way round through the persian highlands. This might just be the straw that breaks the Tadzreuli’s back for the Georgians.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "A man, a Plan, A Canal... Magangue?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Magangue garrison have managed to hold off the coral fleet for one more turn, but it might be all in vain, as the old walls of Bogota crumble under P’kuee’s onslaught. Bolivar’s had his fair share of fuckups this season, and though he wormed his way out of them previously, I can’t see any way he’ll get past this as more than a rump.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "10% pain"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Nigeria seems to be doing a far better job than Zaire in this war, snatching Mwene-Ditu from them and taking Berenike to bargain. The two have open borders, so Zaire’s not completely locked out, but it’s not a good sign in the circumstances. Meanwhile the Nigerian Cavalry bumrush charges up to the walls of Kyrene.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "The Kneecapping of Osaka"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>And that wraps it up for Northern Yuan vs Japan. Japan began on the offensive, but ended up losing half their Siberian territories to Mandukhai after a reversal of fate. In the circumstances the peace deal came at an opportune time, as Kakuei really has no way of reinforcing Osaka from the rest of his empire.</p><p>Yet another Autocrat joins the club. This time it’s Punjab, adopting an ideology surprisingly late for someone of their stature. I mean, come on, Zanzibar beat you to the mark, Singh. *Zanzibar*.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Eyes on the Prize"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>P’kuee immediately takes advantage of her new canal city, sending 3 ships of the line to take Santo Tomas and start mopping up Bolivar’s remains in the pacific. Bogota is still standing, but likely not for much longer. I know we expected Bolivar to come out worse from this war, but no one expected such a sweep.</p><p>Also, returning to the theme of “what the fuck are they doing there”, consider the Burkinabe settler across the andes from Lambare.</p>"

  scene_title: "Chukchinook"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>While interesting things are happening on the sidebar, let’s put them aside for a second and get a rare look at the Dene core. Thanadelthur has been surprisingly militaristic for a leader often known for being passive and unassuming. We also get a look at Chukchi Columbia, recently acquired from former power Chinook. The Chukchi’s (in my opinion hilarious) UA has actually completely severed Seepoosha from the rest of the empire.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "20% pain"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>I have to say, as a Cleopatra supporter this isn’t very fun to see. The Ptolemaic army just simply isn’t advanced enough to hold off both Nigeria and Zaire at the same time. Last time was lucky, but evidently Cleo spent her season’s supply and is now facing the consequences, as more Nigerian Cavalry sweep in.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Landships"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>While Chola’s navy is frankly pretty scary, even when compared to Malacca, it just isn’t worth much when you’re dealing with a landlocked civ, in this case Laos. Sarpang did look like it might go back to being Bhutanese earlier after years of Chola rule, but evidently the two have sued for peace. Meanwhile Laos has the opposite problem. They flipped Pontianak but have no way of stopping the VOC from reinforcing it navally, so it will likely stay with the company for the time being.</p><p>Up in the corner we also get a look at Malaccan Yunnan, which they managed to weasel out of Taiping in the peace treaty last episode.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Khanflict IV : A New Hope"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Khanflict is back for another hackneyed sequel. Frankly this series went downhill after the first one, and I can already see this being a flipfest. However, there is one spanner in the works: Mandukhai brought Manshur Shah in for a guest appearance. While Yuan lacks many coastal cities, if Malacca can get a few embarked units through they could cause a hell of a lot of trouble for Kublai Khan.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Headcannon"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Germany is looking awfully sparse at the moment. Contrast that with Gaul, who have a full carpet at this end of the empire. Okay, admittedly it’s entirely composed of cannons, but at least Vercingetorix is doing *something* with his production. Last I checked Wilhelm had the most hammers by a long way, but he doesn’t have much to show for it.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Namiberty point"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>Namibia was always expected to play second chair to Lesotho, but this is just sad. Moshoeshoe has subjected Jacob Morenga to a slow and painful death by citadels, reducing him to 4 land tiles that aren’t even contiguous. Bethanie still has access to the open oceans, but at this point that won’t be much help, given the last of the 1 tile islands have been claimed. While Lesotho is fairly lightly carpeted, they could still easily wipe Namibia off the map in a matter of turns. Maybe Morenga just wanted to pay tribute to Tahera.</p>"

  scene_title: "15% concentrated power of pain"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>*Sigh* there goes Kyrene. The Ptolemaic resistance looks feebler every time I see it. Cleopatra has flintlock now, bit it really is too little too late, as the combined forces of Nigeria and Zaire press ever northward.</p><p>Also worth noting just how stacked the Twosicilian navy is. If they wanted to they could easily kick the Vandals out of Africa or triumph over any one of their neighbours - other than Germany of course.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Kosov-oh dear"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>Another civ getting slowly citadeled to death is Kosovo, to the point where their capital has shrunk down to a mere 7 citizens (Essen is a pretty appropriate name given it’s eating Kosovo). It also means that the vast majority of their army is separated from it, especially since the Kosovar fleet is locked away in the black sea. If only Rugova settled the Bosporus back in part 1, or he might last a few turns longer when Ferdinand inevitably comes sweeping in.</p>"

  scene_title: "Citadel patrol"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>A collection of Namibian refugees, angered at the injustices suffered by their people, have sworn themselves to Zanzibar’s cause. They now patrol the borders, warily watching for any Zaire general that dares construct a citadel. </p><p>Speaking of Zanzibar, they appear to have caught themselves a pet Trihemiolia.</p>"

  scene_title: "Oooof"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>With the capture of Bogota, Marajoara have well and truly hammered the final nail into Bolivar’s chances. P’kuee seems to be losing steam in the pacific, but at this point there’s nothing there but Santo Tomas and a few insignificant towns. One last Gran Colombian musketman makes a brave attempt to climb the walls, but it is but a forlorn hope. Honestly I’m a Marajoara supporter, but after he got shafted out of last season, I was kinda hoping Bolivar would get a better showing than what he got, but at the same time, I’m a sucker for a surprise power.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Things are, shockingly, at a stalemate between the Yuans. Whoever could have predicted that? I say that, but it looks like Mandukhai might just break through on the northern front. Oh who am I kidding. Nothing between these two is ever gonna amount to anything.</p><p>We also get reminded that Kolchak, a once-frontrunner who has sunk into obscurity as of late, still has a fairly sizable army in the area.</p>"

  narration: "<p>An even better look at the Taiping lands ceded to Malacca - I didn’t actually realise how far north these went. Hilariously, Gelephu is totally cut off from any reinforcement, as Mansur Shah failed to check the small print in the treaty about connecting tiles. It’s a small act of pettiness, but that’s all Hong can hope to get away with against the current top dog.</p>"

Meanwhile, the hawaiian navy now consists of a single Galleas, after the rest was smashed into the walls of Fa’a’a. Even their land army is mainly melee units, so they can’t really hope to defend against the incoming assault. </p>"

  narration: "<p>You forgot this war was even going on, didn’t you. I certainly did, but Kidal might actually be about to fall, probably since Sankara brought some better siege equipment to the frontlines. If it does, there’s a good chance that it’ll be curtains for the Blue Men of the desert, since they only have a pikeman and a scout in terms of melee units.</p><p>It just occurred to me that the vandals don’t even have frigates yet.</p>"

In fact, I’d actually wager Coen could lose a city here if Lili moves her armies through the strait. This truly is not stonks for VOC investors.</p><p>Camouflaged amongst the Jongs are an increasing number of Ironclads. Whoever next draws Mansur Shah’s wrath is in for a rough time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Just as soon as it was resettled, New Dutch Florida is about to fall again, to the chagrin of Wiltwyck Man. Genseric keeps the majority of his forces around Caput Vada, oddly refusing to move them. At this point though, he hardly needs to. The New Dutch resistance has been so half-hearted that he’s been able to take their eastern seaboard with like 5 ships.</p><p>On the topic of ships, Marajoara is fielding some of the first Cruisers, the industrial upgrade of the frigate.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kulbai Khan is suddenly back on the offensive, holding his capital and flipping Khanbaliq. However, the Yellow Sea is starting to fill with Chukchi ships, ominously. Meanwhile in Kunming, we see some absolutely absurd border gore, and it wasn’t even Chukchi shenanigans. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Ahh, this is what the Malaccan declaration against Tongva was for - mopping up those cheeky settles around Fiji. We also see that William Barak, annoyed at missing out on the Bolivar partition, makes peace. I think VOC managed to flip Batavia, but it will likely remain Chola going forward.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh now this is big if true. Kulin and Marajoara have teamed up again to take on Mapuche, the other big contender for South America. However, I don’t think this is going entirely as planned for Barak, as he’s probably gonna lose his Antarctic colonies to Lautaro.Nevertheless, this war will likely decide who comes out on top in the continent that produced civs like Brazil and Uruguay in the past.</p>"

  narration: "<p>P’kuee already has a hefty army in the area to deal with Maracaibo, so Lautaro had better send a navy up to Pora Pora in case she decides to go further with it.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene113.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here’s a front I didn’t really consider: with the fall of Tabocas, the Marajoara-Mapuche land border is significantly bigger. This might actually be profitable for Mapuche, as even though the Marajoara are more advanced, they’re still a bit clapped out from eating Gran Colombia, while Mapuche are relatively fresh and energized from the warmup capture of Tabocas.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Punjab’s strategy of ramming individual ships into Ta’if is oddly not working very well. Funny thing, that. Then again, I never expected Punjab to be any good at naval combat so this is unsurprising. Chola flips Batavia again, just to show how it’s supposed to be done.</p><p>We also see another two civs join Autocraposse: Gaul and Finland. This is definitely gonna cause some heat in Europe, given the Gauls are Germany’s main rival, and Finland can certainly throw a punch if they need to. It also means that in a twist of fate, Finland and USSR are on the same team. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Gran Colombia, the cylinder’s latest citystate, has now been relegated to the old Peru-Bolivian city of Lima. A combination of peacekeepers and a distracted P’kuee means Bolivar can relax for a bit, given the spotlight is off him for the time being. Meanwhile the Marajoara war machine smashes into Pora Pora.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Despite Nigeria still having the units, this front has actually stagnated, somehow. The two core cities have kept flipping by the look of it. I must have missed it earlier, but Ferdinand researched armour plating, so *all* of his frigates are now cruisers. Scary. If only he’d actually use them for something.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Chola is running low on ships, but the VOC are running dry too, so I’d say Batavia and Ambon are gone for keeps. The old VOC capital, once a thriving hub of commerce and trade, is now a smoking shadow of its former self.</p>"

  narration: "<p>So apparently Raja Raja is aware of these cities in the south Indian Ocean, but doesn’t really care enough to capture them. I mean, other than Shebab’s palace, what’s there worth taking?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Genseric fancies a cigar or two, and moves on to New Dutch Cuba in his Atlantic campaign. Rio Grande’s navy is laughably outdated at this point, but even those carracks could wipe out Swaandael if Rosillo declared war.</p>"

  scene_title: "Northern Yuan best Yuan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode12-scene120.jpg
  narration: "<p>Khanbaliq falls to Mandukhai! I guess we can now truly answer the question of who the best Yuan is. I expected this war to just be another Khanflict, but when Kublai Khan’s neighbours jumped in it really went south fast. Almost as fast as the Northern Yuan’s army did.</p><p>From this point on I’m not sure what position Mandukhai sits in. The newly acquired Yuan cities will provide some desperately needed non-tundra cities to build infrastructure in, but in such a competitive asia, will she be able to claw her way back to being the contender that the episode 0 PRs predicted? It’s gonna be hard, and there aren’t many options for expansion left without getting lucky in a coalition war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This war seems to be stalemating so far, though Nayxoxar has flipped to the Chinook. Other than that the Great Basin is a meat grinder, with no significant progress from either side. On the naval front, the Tongva have wiped out the Chinook navy, though the actual capital is probably too well defended for them to capture.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Marajoaran Pacfic navy seems to be running out of steam, though Pora Pora flipped at some point. As for Lima, I can’t see embarked field cannons taking it any time soon, so Bolivar is still safe.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah, that must have been what that army was for. Rosillo avoids trying to attack Stuyvesent through the Appalachians by simply being on the other side of them. What a handy trick! We also get a reveal of just how empty the Mississippian core is. They have twice as many naval units in this shot as on land - and they’re practically landlocked! Okay sure they have the cities on Hudson’s Bay, but a conveniently placed ice tile prevents the navy from leaving it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And in the final shot of the episode, we see that Rosillo did in fact have naval techs, but was probably just too broke to upgrade his ships, and Swaanendael begins to come under bombardment from them.</p><p>What an episode to narrate! It was only 30 turns, but in those turns we had so much happen that it’s easy to forget. For starters:</p><p>- The Ptolemies were ripped into by Nigeria, losing half their empire.</p><p>- Marajoara reduced Gran Colombia to a city state and moved on to fight Mapuche.</p><p>- Chola humiliated Laos and the VOC, rising to become a naval great power to rival Malacca.</p><p>- Yuan was partitioned by its neighbours, notably spearheaded by long time rivals Northern Yuan.</p><p>- The Vandals solidified their hold on the East Coast of America.</p><p>- Hawaii got btfo</p><p>And that’s not including all the small things that we saw happen: little saplings that will eventually grow into great drama trees in future episodes.</p><p>So there we have it, this has been Arilasqueto writing, and have an acceptable rest of your week!</p>"
