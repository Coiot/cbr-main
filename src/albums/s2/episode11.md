  narration: "<p>Hello, everyone! My name is FortVectortude and I am honored to finally narrate a part of the Civ Battle Royale! I’ve been a fan and member of the sub since the days of Mk. 2 (Trung Sisters!), but I’ve just been lurking in the background without interacting much. As an avid Civilization fan and a history nerd, this has been a source of much entertainment and joy over the years. Hopefully, this narration is good enough for a rookie to get invited back again. Now let’s get going!</p>"

Even though I just set up our goal to fund our new recording machine necessary to begin next season, we’re already 26% of the way there! Most are coming in from one-time donations (which still get a month’s access to rewards), but if the show is something you enjoy, please do consider our suggested $3 a month pledge to push us into the next season and hopefully several more years to come.   </p>"

That’s what you get in Mansur Shah’s Malacca. He must be a disciple of the Cobra Kai dojo because he lives by these three principles: strike first, strike hard, no mercy. Coastlines beware, you’re in for a scare!</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin with a look at the Chinook interior, as Comcomly is forced to reposition his main army and defend against Tuscaloosa. Lawtiliwadlin did give open borders to the Chinook, forcing the dejected army to drag their cannons through the lands they once called home. Meanwhile, Nemah takes some crossbow and cannon fire, but the Chinook general holds steadfast against the Mississippi, for now. With more cannons coming from the east, Nemah needs those reinforcements to come quickly.</p><p></p><p>The wholesale loss of Neacoxie will sting Comcomly for some time, as it also squeezes Seepoosha into a very vulnerable pocket ripe for the Dene to attack.</p>"

The terrain may help Solano Lopez stall for time and pump out units to hold Northern Paraguay.</p><p></p><p>P'küee, on the other hand, seems to be faring much better, bearing down on Quito with muskets and cannons. Bolívar entrusts the city’s defense to a contingent of crossbows, as they await reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>Across the Atlantic, Mobutu Sese Seko bolsters the defenses of the Zaire capital with the completion of the Fasil Ghebbi wonder.

Laos has the firepower to finally make a dent into the Malay peninsula, but if Fa Ngum mucks it up, this could be another meatgrinder on the Cylinder.</p><p></p><p>The Chola citadels around Uraiyur continue to fend off Laotian advances. And would you look at the Jongs of Mansur Shah? Oh yeah, and he’s also rocking 4 line infantry units in this slide.

The Dutch Caribbean is sparsely defended enough that the Vandals capture Haverstroo with just their advance fleet. Even the Rio Grande has a better naval presence in this slide. Do better, Pete, or prepare to kiss those tropical beaver pelts goodbye.</p><p></p><p>Lesotho is also enjoying a golden age in southern Africa.

With only a lone galleass and three wandering trebuchets in the vicinity, Gran Colombian’s Polynesian penal colonies are no more.</p><p></p><p>The smoke rising on the distant horizon does not trouble Tahiti, as Queen Purea’s core thrives with Tai’arapu and Pape’ete at 29 and 31 pop, respectively.

Mitrovicë is flipped and will be flipped into oblivion. Such is life. Out west, we see a German cuirassier unit seemingly taking on the walls of Gjakovë by itself. If so, then it’s a bit stupid, but not bad, Wilhelm II. You’ve blunted Ferdinand I’s offensive with minimal effort.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Rocky Mountains are proving to be an excellent natural defense for Antonio Canales Rosillo, allowing his cannons to rip through advancing Tongva troops. Sure, the knight right outside of Matamoros is a little nerve-wracking, but the single-tile river crossing required to attack the city should hold up against a Tongva attack without siege weapons. Any real encounters between these warring neighbors will have to be made further south.</p><p></p><p>The Qwatsamts salient of the remaining Chinook lands is devoid of any major troop presence, a worrying site for fans of the Fighting Salmon. The Mississippi appear to have committed their armies toward the capture of Nemah, leaving their southern border undermanned. If the Rio Grande had more substantial forces, they could stretch Tuscaloosa’s capacities with some shady backdoor raids.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah yes, the front of futility, the trenches of trivial trials and tribulations, the meatgrinder of millennia, the dreaded dance of death and destruction; welcome back to the Yuan-flict. Brutally bloodied and battered bastards hold the line here at the front. Both sides are tired, having known nothing but the constant orders to advance and retreat to no permanent effect. Mandukhai believes that will change, as the Northern Yuan begin to field their 2nd UU, the Chongzu. This lancer replacement could turn the tide if trained in numbers, as it has no city attack penalty, gains XP faster, and can be sacrificed in a friendly city for production. Can Kublai Khan weather this new oncoming threat?</p><p></p><p>Our world-traveling Neutral Nation warrior wisely avoids the frontlines of the Yuan duel. The Twin Sicilians did not get the memo, as a lone bowman(?) unit wanders too far away from its cuirassier escort.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Kolchak begrudgingly makes peace with Saint Stephen after no gain whatsoever.

Wilhelm II cannot rest easy though, because that interior is emptier than a vegan’s stomach at a barbecue. Stack up quickly, or Vercingetorix may come calling at Berlin’s doorstep.</p><p></p><p>Iceland may be in a golden age, but Kristján Eldjárn actually receives two new declarations of war this turn. No need to worry about the warring words from Ferdinand I, but Tuscaloosa throwing down the gauntlet means that Icelandic Canada could actually be threatened.</p>"

Take a look at Mandukhai’s cities. Every one of them has sustained damage, which means Kublai Khan’s UA, Mandate Lost, has come into play. Yuan scholars will research a tech of their enemy during wartime, and their opponents’ cities will take damage each turn once they’ve been surpassed in tech. That time has come for the Northern Yuan. Will it really truly change anything at all?</p>"

The Nigerian snipe-post of Mogadishu is defended by the Cylinder’s first riflemen, while the navy is about to be boxed in. The new African Hejazi core is well carpeted, but Jeddah is left vulnerable on the home peninsula. The Chola holdings here are developing nicely, rocking the most modern navy in this slide. Bargash bin Said’s Zanzibar isn’t doing too shabby either, but Lesothan Madagascar’s border growth could make the sovereignty of the western Indian Ocean even messier.</p><p></p><p>Peep that sidebar, y’all. Ferdinand I gives up on his invasion of Germany. Maybe next time, use those big boats in the Mediterranean on a close target you can actually reach, pal. No? Ok, fine, he declares war on… the Northern Yuan. I SAID “CLOSE!” The Two Sicilies get Jan Coen and the VOC to join him in the war against Mandukhai.</p>"

King Karl XII had promised them that reinforcements were on the way, but these veteran commanders knew better. Time was of the essence, and it did not favor the Swedes. The southern citadels were already covered in smoke. With the Red Army at their doorstep, any reprieve would arrive too late. Their subordinates might retake the city, but the watch of the admiral and general would soon be over. As they sent out their final orders, the commanders broke out a bottle of akvavit, a spiced vodka, knowing that the burn of this drink would almost certainly be their last. Skål.</p><p></p><p>For you Teutonic Order fans, check out the brand-spanking-new ritterbrüder unit, Hermann von Salza’s UU. Useless for a tiny landlocked city-state, but still pretty cool.</p>"

The smoking husk of Anqing has flipped 5 times so far, and the considerable Taiping mainland army ensures that the port city will continue to change hands for quite some time. Further up the coast, Longping falls into the red from Mansur Shah’s jongs. Malaccan ground forces had better move quickly before Taiping reserves begin streaming in from Gelephu and Wuchang.</p><p></p><p>Check out that defensive carpet draped over the Himalayas by Bhutan. Sure, Wangchuck are almost exclusively crossbows in this shot, but in rough terrain, range can do a world of hurt.</p><p></p><p>On the upper left, we see that William Barak had decided to join the growing Communist bloc, adopting the Order ideology.

Northern Yuan troops have left their eastern border worryingly empty, allowing the Japanese to march on Xilinhot relatively unopposed. You Northern Yuan fans had better hope that Mandukhai has only shifted her forces south to defend Avarga and block the Yuan from approaching Karakorum. Otherwise, the Yuan-flict could tip in Kublai Khan’s favor with the assistance of Kakuei’s surprising ambition.</p>"

Our noble leaders decide to rest their eyes upon the peaceful waters of northern Spain, basking in the praise from their people.</p><p></p><p>Our first good look at the new Spanish island capital of Samarobriva is not one that inspires confidence. The Spanish Armada is virtually nonexistent in its home waters of the Bay of Biscay. The Gallic navy, while outdated with its spread of galleasses, could probably blow the lone Spanish ship out of the water. If there was ever a time for Vercingetorix to try an amphibious assault to enter Iberia, there’s no better time like the present.</p><p></p><p>And check out that chain of Vandal caravans heading east into the European interior.

While the Marajoaran defenders are few in number, they are technologically superior to their gray-on-gray foes. With 3 attackers already deep in the red, P'küee’s navy should be able to hold the city.</p><p></p><p>Peter Stuyvesant continues to try and fight, but his battle strategy isn’t doing too hot. Tsouharissen laughs at the half-hearted jab thrown at Niagara. Don’t laugh too hard though, as an additional schutterij UU and a trebuchet could start hitting the city proper.

Since the nearest Gran Colombian melee unit is a measly scout, May Pen might be a solid grab for the Marajoarans. P'küee has significant naval superiority over Bolívar, both in tech advancement and in numbers. El Libertador might have those Jamaican “liberations” snatched away from him soon, and for good if he can’t get some melee units out in those waters.</p><p></p><p>Up north in the Bahamas, Haverstroo is still smoking from its conquest by the Vandals. Peter Stuyvesant has mobilized a rescue team in Wiltwyck, but has sent a galleass and trebuchet ahead of them.

  narration: "<p>The Yuan-flict is back and it’s still as wack as ever. My hunch was right and Mandukhai did reposition her troops to better defend her capital of Karakorum. There’s just 2 problems with this plan. One, about a third of visible Northern Yuan forces are weak scouts or outdated composite bowmen. Two, her soldiers are doing NOTHING. Avarga has been captured by the Yuan by walking in with a single unit of musketmen. Meanwhile, Bayan Tumen is in the yellow despite having a numerically superior defensive force around the city, and every one of Mandukhai’s other cities have lost even more health to Kublai Khan’s Mandate Lost UA.</p><p></p><p>Don’t trip though, as Kublai isn’t exactly playing up to his potential. His interior is looking a little too wide open, while his amassed armies in Kaifeng and Kaiping have not fully committed to the frontlines yet. You have a UA that’s putting in some work, Kublai. At least meet it halfway!</p><p></p><p>And check out the border gore to the southwest.

Staten Eylant being a flaming dump heap seems to be just as true here on the Cylinder as it is in our world. If the Mississippian reinforcements around Etowah can reach the front quickly, then Mosfellsbær and Andachkhrob could be next on the flaming chopping block.</p><p></p><p>Peter Stuyvesant looks to send troops to accompany his galleasses in attempting to capture the icy Vandal outpost of Saldae.

The Japanese have taken advantage of the Yuan’s Mandate Lost UA to knock the 12-pop city deep into the yellow. Mandukhai has plenty of reinforcements on the way though, so any city capture will likely be flipped right back. Both of the Yuans let a single melee unit walk right up to a frontline city’s walls, trusting those brave souls to take on the city by themselves. Chukchi cuirassiers watch on from behind Japanese lines, wondering if they might see some action in this part of the world.</p><p></p><p>Just out of frame, Avarga is reclaimed by Mandukhai.
