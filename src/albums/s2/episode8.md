    narration: "<p>For the fourth episode in a row, Ranjit Singh’s Punjab is number one, and it isn’t hard to see why. Their military and production are second to none, though they could stand to be a little less… quiet. Are they unstoppable?

    narration: "<p>We begin this episode on turn 210 in the Pacific, where the Tahitian navy continues to repel the Kulin navy from its shores. While superior in tech and production, the Kulin just don’t seem that interested in bringing their A-game to Tahiti, opting instead to treat their tropical excursion less like an invasion and more like an overpriced timeshare.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, the city-state of Saigon makes peace with the Manchu, while in Africa, Namibia declares war on Burkina Faso-- a bold move, given the trouble they’re facing on the homefront.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In Manchurian Korea, Chukchi and Japanese naval units continue to whittle away at Manchu defenses. Chukchi galleases are clearly doing most of the heavy lifting here-- if Japanese triremes were just a little bit better placed, Tanaka Kakuei could potentially unify Honshu under his banner.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, Burkina Faso trades peace with Jerusalem for Chola joining the dogpile.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We turn now to the Red Sea, where Cleopatra has embarked the bulk of her eastern forces in her push to conquer Hejaz. The capture of Al-Qunfidah opened up a zone of control that should be helpful in eventually taking Medina. While the Ptolemaic navy and army are technologically and numerically superior, we’ve seen the AI fail at hybrid land-sea invasions on far too many occasions to count. If there’s any silver lining for Hussein bin Ali, let it be that the AI is still the AI-- and that Cleopatra only has one melee unit anywhere remotely near Mecca, where the siege hasn’t even started yet.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, Zumbi has declared war on Wales, perhaps in an effort to learn the secrets of the Lord of Light, as Palmares will likely be enveloped in Vandal flames very, very soon.</p>"

    narration: "<p>On the western front of Cleopatra’s empire, the cities of Paraitonion and Elephantine are probably wishing they had some of those units currently sailing towards Hejaz, as they’d come in handy in the fight against Thomas Sankara. While the Ptolemies clearly have the technological knowhow to produce an army that could crush Burkina Faso, they’ve left their frontier dangerously exposed to an invasion by that civilization. There’s definitely room for some city flips here.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, Tahiti and Mississippi call it quits.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In the South China Sea, Malacca continues its impressive push against the Heavenly Kingdom, sending its navy into an area spanning from the Qiongzhou Strait to the Pearl River Delta. Having annexed Qingpu, it’s clear Mansur is playing for keeps.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, another War for Winter begins as the Chukchi declare war on the Chinook, likely as a result of that civ’s consolidation of Alaska.</p>"

    scene_title: "& Thanks For All The Fish"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene11.jpg
    narration: "<p>Right from the start we see Alaskan waters filled with the Chinook’s unique unit, the Equai-ah. This workboat replacement deals a modest amount of ranged damage and is quick to retreat from combat. Compared with the Chukchi navy they aren’t very powerful on their own-- but in large numbers, they could be enough to repel an invasion, or at least soften up Seamysty ahead of recapture.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In Japanese Siberia and Yuan Classic, Northern Yuanese (Yuanite?) troops continue to trickle into the realms of both civs, dealing modest damage to Kashiwazaki and Kaifeng-- on the whole, however, it’s status quo Siberian meatgrinder. </p>"

    narration: "<p>In the Sahel, Burkina Faso continues to fortify its desert holdings along the Vandal-and-Tuareg border. As predicted, Cleopatra was caught with her kalasiris down as Elephantine falls to Sankara’s troops. If the Ptolemies don’t send reinforcements west ASAP, they risk embarrassment not seen since the Neutral Nation got boxed in by New Netherlands.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, Punjab and the Manchu make peace.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Wangchuck’s expedition against Raja Raja continues to backslide into disaster as the season three drag superstar sends a naval pincer to soften up Phuntsholing. If that city falls, the Bhutanese will have a hard time taking it back, given the apparent ranged-to-melee ratio between the two sparring civs.</p>"

    narration: "<p>On the Arabian peninsula, Cleopatra finds success in taking Hejaz cities. Haqi has been captured and set ablaze, while the siege-- and citadelification -of Mecca has begun. Still, the Ptolemaic carpet seems to be fizzling out, even here where it was pervasive just a few slides ago.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Over in North America, the Chinook seem less-than-interested in finishing off the Three Affiliated Tribes. While Four Bears could take back Seepoosha or even take Nemah, it probably won’t be enough to save them-- especially with all those Mississippian troops moving into the area.</p>"

    scene_title: "$JAM Tomorrow, $JAM Yesterday"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene18.jpg
    narration: "<p>It looks like the OG World-Ender, Gran Colombia, may just have enough juice to exact revenge on Jamaica and sack Kingston. $DOGE, $JAM, my ego-- it doesn’t matter: what goes up must come down.</p><p></p><p>In the Pacific, Hawaii and Tahiti sign the Treaty of Two Pineapples and enjoy peace once more.</p>"

    scene_title: "Formosa? I hardly know her!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene19.jpg
    narration: "<p>Malacca continues to impress, and the capture of Huangmei has created yet another staging point from which to invade mainland China. With no heavenly navy in sight, the balance of power in the South China Sea probably won’t be changing any time soon.</p><p></p><p>To the north, Japan and the Manchy make peace, evidently without any cities switching hands.</p>"

    scene_title: "You Tried"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene20.jpg
    narration: "<p>Back in North America, it’s becoming abundantly clear that Seepoosha and Nemho are just too defensible for the Three Affiliated Tribes to capture at this time. Still, Four Bears deserves *some* credit, as he’s not going down without a fight.</p>"

    scene_title: "Chieftain Difficulty"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene21.jpg
    narration: "<p>To the east, the Neutrals have taken Stuyvesant’s Icelandic trophy in a rather skillful snipe, but it is of no consequence as Mosfellbaer contains a distinct lack of beavers.</p><p></p><p>That said, Stuyvesant’s insistence on throwing mounted units at Kandoucho is… I mean, it’s a choice. Not a very good one, though.</p>"

    narration: "<p>While the Tahitian “core” of single-tile islands seems safe from Kulin invaders for the moment, the same cannot be said for their holdings in New Zealand. If William Barak puts his mind to it, he can take South Island and really get to consolidating his little corner of the cylinder-- unless, of course, Malacca decides to start trying again.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Raja Raja captures Phuntsholing, puts on some Paula Abdul, and makes things hot-- by setting the port city ablaze. With only two damaged triremes nearby, Carmen-- er, Wangchuck --has virtually no chance to take the city back before it completely burns down.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene24.jpg
    narration: "<p>In German Scandinavia, the Kaiserreich has once again turned its impressive industrial might towards making a mighty army-- and navy. Honestly, at this rate of shipbuilding, Germany doesn’t need to send units to the Icelandic front-- the carpet will just eventually make its way over there on its own.</p><p>Offscreen, Gran Colombia and what’s left of Peru-Bolivia make peace; the Soviets declare war on at least one Sicily, but no more than two.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season2-episode8-scene25.jpg
    narration: "<p>Another look now at the Kulin-Tahiti war where Purea can be seen making a bold play for Woori Yallock. It won’t work, of course, but this is causing the Kulin to commit some serious manpower to their Oceanic front, when they should really be shoring up their defenses against Malacca.</p><p></p><p>In the top-left we see evidence of the continued existence of the Tongva, which is cute.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Back in west Africa, we-- wait a sec, what… the Tuareg captured Elephantine? A Burkina Faso city that was originally Ptolemaic?! I… well then. Eat your heart out LRS, and Aaron? Have a drink on me.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, in west Africa we catch a glimpse of what is easily the most fortified border on the cylinder. In this one shot alone I count at least 37 forts and a citadel. Burkina Faso continues its rampage against the Ptolemies, capturing Paraitonion from Cleopatra, who has a very sparse force available to take it back.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere in the slide, Awolowo continues to press forward with his tech-and-wonder obsession, allowing Nigeria to claim for itself the powerful Himeji Castle. Meanwhile, the Tuareg-- evidently on a high after taking Elephantine --make the very ill-advised decision to attack several Sicilies.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Bolivar’s trireme navy continues to chip away at Kingston’s defenses, but the plucky Jamaican military seems to be holding its own-- for now. If Gran Colombia finds a way to take out that swordsman fortified west of Kingston… well, it would be bad news for Marcus Garvey.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, a potentially major development unfolds as PARG declares war on Northern Yuan.</p>"

    scene_title: "A Girl Is No Yuan"

    narration: "<p>The two Asian powers share a complicated border that spans the Siberian steppe while snaking through the Gobi Desert. Along the front are several defensible cities positioned between lakes and mountains alike.</p><p></p><p>At the outset of this war, PARG doesn’t seem organized enough to mount a major offensive-- that said, the Northern Yuanese (Yuananite?) core has been completely sapped over these last few episodes, and raiding parties of Yuan Classic™ horsemen have been able to reach Karakorum with startling ease. This may not end well for Mandukhai.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Ooh, now things are really starting to heat up: Vercingetorix has declared war on no fewer than two whole Sicilies, igniting a conflict that could cost millions of lives.</p><p></p><p>I believe it was Napoleon who once said that one cannot hope to take Italy by invading it from the sea-- that one must enter from the north, like a boot. If that’s true, the Gauls and their massive land army have a decent shot at doing some real damage to Ferdiand’s empire. Having said that, Ferdinand’s Mediterranean navy is a staggering, diverse carpet of units, and his empire is almost exclusively port cities. Any place the Gauls could take by land could easily flip back the next turn-- and as a result devastate the large population centers of cities like Palermo and Alesia.</p><p></p><p>Still, Vercingetorix’s army is mostly ranged and mounted units. At least for right now, Ferdinand *should* be able to protect his people.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Back east, Taiping manages to land some knights onto the isle of Formosa, retaking the city of Huangmei from the Malaccan menace. Malacca, for its part, has sent a detachment of its navy into the East China Sea, albeit a fleet devoid of any melee ships. This war is a slog, and Mansur’s navy is far from home. According to sailors on some Malaccan vessels, the faint cries of Japanese missionaries can sometimes be heard on calm nights like a siren’s song; “have you heard the good word? Naruhodo!”</p>"

    narration: "<p>Elsewhere in Asia, PARG sends its troops into Northern Yuan through both the desert and the tundra. Erdene Zuu is in real danger of falling, while far too many PARG catapults are sent to retake Vladivostok. PARG is lucky that Northern Yuan is occupied with a two front war, as their carpet at home is looking more like an old bath mat these days.</p><p></p><p>In Omsk, Kolchak’s economic advisor grimaces at the bill for the five scouts bouncing around the homeland, saying, “we have enough explorers to discover the world, please for the love of God, build units that can take cities.”</p><p></p><p>Kolchak waves her off, “right, yeah, more catapults, got it.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>Over in Central America, U Kix Chan begins to desperately search his jean jacket pockets for any pendants of life he may still have hidden away somewhere as the New Netherlands navy and a flotilla of Tongva units inch towards the Olmec capital of Tonala. To make matters worse, fully half of the Olmec land army is embarked and unaccompanied in the Caribbean Sea, where they are easy pickings for Stuyvesant’s navy.</p><p></p><p>Note to the Olmecs: “Blue Barracudas” is a team name. You’re not actually barracudas. Come back to dry land.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, the Finns make peace with Northern Yuan, which apparently sparks a new Finnish Renaissance.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In the North Pacific, the Chinook navy’s unique units appear to have devastated much of the technologically superior Chukchi fleet. Perhaps it was a numbers game, or perhaps it was because wild-caught salmon is the latest superfood-- regardless, with more melee units near Seamysty than the Chukchi, Comcomly has a golden opportunity to reclaim his former port city from Lawtiliwadlin, if only for a short time at least.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Hey! We haven’t seen these civs in a while. Zanzibar, Somalia, and Lesotho still exist! Regarding hostilities between Somalia and Lesotho, the former seems to be protected at the moment by the dual factors of a) Zanzibar and Lesotho not sharing open borders; and b) Lesotho lacking any units that can cross ocean tiles.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, Uzbekistan goes back to war with Georgia.

Kolchak’s army does not appear to have taken too many hits in the assault, but Mandukhai’s forces are howling, and her core largely undefended. To make matters worse, there also appears to be a rather large horde of mixed units filing in from the east towards Bayan Tumen out of Yuan Classic™.</p>"

    narration: "<p>On the Arabian peninsula and in the Red Sea, Hejaz’s last stand is starting to look like a military masterstroke. Not only has the Ptolemaic assault on Mecca been halted, but both Al-Qunfidhah and Haql have been recaptured. While Cleopatra has superiority in tech and numbers, she just cannot quite crack open Hejaz. If she were smart she’d peace out and move her forces to deal with the real threat to her west: Burkina Faso.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, the Neutral Nation breaks bread with Marajoara.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Looking east again, we have… still quite a lot of border gore, as last episode the Manchu capital of Mukden was citadeled from both sides, with Yuan and Japan reducing the city’s holdings to a narrow hook at the base of the Korean peninsula. Kublai Khan continues to pump out units, bringing down Bayan Tumen’s health into the yellow while also sending a serious complement (Siege units! Melee units!) of troops towards Mukden. Meanwhile, the Chukchi are doing the same, albeit with less Manchu resistance along the way.</p><p></p><p>If Kublai manages to snipe Mukden after a Chukchi siege, well, there are going to a be a lot of people on #stonk-chat laughing their way to the bank.</p>"

While Ra’iatea can knock out a swordsman or two, it looks to me like it will be too little too late. Tahiti’s navy, while putting up a valiant effort, is simply outnumbered by Kulin reinforcements streaming in from the west.</p><p></p><p>Offscreen, the Vandals make peace with Northern Yuan, and then presumably build another thirty trade routes to celebrate.</p>"

Seamysty is safe for now, and the Chukchi navy is making its way east, but Ujvyn is at serious risk of falling to Chinook chariots, and I don’t see many naval units in the area that could take it back. Sure, it’s a frozen hellhole, but it’s *their* frozen hellhole. I mean, it’ll probably be burned down regardless.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere else on the cylinder, it looks like a capital has fallen!

Sure, Kactchanas is taking damage, as is Gibeon, but at least Gibeon has an excuse-- it’s Gibeon. It exists to take damage and be flipped. That’s not Namibia’s fault.

William Barak’s empire is well-fed and productive, sure, but if he doesn’t find some luxuries soon to balance out his lust for island massacres, this problem isn’t going anywhere. Vegemite and Foster’s can only get you so far.</p>"

The problem here is that this is *before* capturing any Yuan cities (which they will most definitely burn) and *after* losing cities to Malacca.
