  narration: "<p>Welcome to the first, and probably only, session of the ExplosiveWatermelon Literature Club! (or EWLC) Today, we’re gonna be reading the Hero’s Journey, a historical piece written by famed Scottish poet Algernon Charles Swinburne. (Of note: Not the guy on the Sub) Anybody who has complaints with the authenticity of the book, or that of its contents are boring, are immediately to be kicked out of the literature club and sent into the OC mines. Let’s get started.</p>"

  narration: "<p>OrangeChrisy on the sub made this prediction that Tonga, despite not reaching prime Tonga Time just yet, will eventually reach a height that is unprecedented. As the creator of Tonga myself, I thought it would be fitting.</p>"

  narration: "<p>However, for a unique twist Spherical_Melon (The obviously lesser melon) has made a unique theory that the world is Melon-shaped. Of course, it’s not true, but there’s always a few outliers. Here’s a map he made for if the world were Melon-shaped.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene05.jpg
  narration: "<p>At #1 is the Khamugs! Three parts, three different leaders of the power rankings! Lungora must be very proud of her mod to have made it to #1 in the rankings. Interestingly enough, these guys seem to be mimicking the Yakutia by expanding very early on and actually doing nothing, but who knows? It’s still very early, and I’d be very excited to see something go down between the Khamugs and, let’s say, the Qing. Now, let’s get to the story.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This is the story of me, Algernon Charles Swinburne.</p><p></p><p>Should death come for me as I write my many stories of the world I’ve travelled so well, I would wish people to know of the most beautiful place in the world- the simple riverlands of the Americas, where the Apache were soon to meet the Poverty Point’s warriors in battle. Geronimo Kujo, the lord-chief, spoke to me himself about his reasons for desecrating such a sacred place with the blood of his enemies. “I can’t kick their ass unless I get closer.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>“Ah Fuck,” I thought, “The Evenks.”Surely were their people not quite as notable as, say, anybody else in the world, but they did have two aspects of notoriety- being the birthplace of the inventor of the Snowman (Van Illya Eis), and for having the world’s beloved Scout-Con. Attendants are excited, claiming that “It’s almost enough to make you forget that you’re freezing to death!”</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>My Homelands, the Scottish Isles (Not including those Dastardly Isle of Man) is known for its emerald shores, relaxing activities (Such as Golf, Mini-Golf, and Enlarged Golf), and the occasional wisdom you get from junkies. (Like me!) Occasionally, on clear sky nights, you can see the lights of the Vikings shine. Of course, these are their funeral boats, but kids shouldn’t hear that!</p>"

  narration: "<p>On my visit to Pyongyang, I noticed the most delicious aroma in the streets, the city was lit up, and it was almost enough to make you forget that the city was actually on fire. The new overlords had tried to put out fires, but they quickly discovered something.“Yeah, we don’t have any way to put out massive fires yet.” One man said. “If only there was like… A large tube that could funnel water out the other end at high speeds, this would be easier.”Other news in Asia was the state of Xiang (EW’s note: Xia + Shang), a wonderful place to visit because it feels as miserable as it looks! It was so interesting to me I left one of my pupils stay there for studies. A lad named Thomas Jones. It’s a strange name, I know, but when I asked him, he said “It’s Not Unusual.”</p><p></p><p>The nations of Qin and Qing are very happy, despite citizens often forgetting which one they live in. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The region of Francia, connected to Al-Andalusia, is quite empty. Three cities litter the entire western half- Cologne of the Holy Romans, Murano of the Venetians, and Balansiyyah (Boy, I sure hope nobody reading this story years from now will ever have to read that) of the Moors. The Venetians of the period I spent there were at war with the Holy Romans, to whom they referred to as “Imperials.” Honestly, it seemed a bit boring, however, as only skirmishes dotted the countryside.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I remember crossing Konstantiniyye and seeing all the Palmyrene troops on the other side. I asked them what they were doing.</p><p>“Certainly no war-related stuff, nope, no sirree!” He said in a voice that was entirely non-suspicious. Since there was no war-related stuff, I carried on.</p><p></p><p>Oh yeah, the Czech Republic and Minoa also exist, but before I could enter Czechia I got stopped at the “Czech”point. Get it? Boy, that was a clever joke. I should patent jokes of that style, and call them puns. (Translator’s note: Puns were invented 2 years before this writing was published.) Oh yeah, Minoa. I didn’t even bother going there. Do you know how hard it is to find a boat in this era that can survive the journey to Crete? Very hard.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>In Asia, I found the most peculiar place- a desert, not torn by war nor settlement. It seemed surreal, as if that was how (Whatever deity the Scottish people believe in. Mel Gibson?) intended the Cylinder to be like.I didn’t like it, so I informed the Indians and they resolved to rectify this mistake.</p><p></p><p>The other nations were at peace, but I stopped by the ex-Seljuk city of Hamadan. Honestly, I would not recommend stopping by any city ravaged by war. Apparently they’re not very pretty.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Indian subcontinent was very beautiful. So much so that I forgot to write about it. There was the new city of Pokhara, deep in the rich vegetation that I stopped by. I don’t recall much about it, but I’m sure it’ll be important someday.</p><p></p><p>Oh wait, there was one thing I recall- there were a lot of soldiers doing non-war-related activities. It did not pique my curiosity.</p>"

  scene_title: "Mythical Peoples"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Euch, Tonga. Even the legendary god of Tonga, Ee Yoo, is reported to have hated these people so much that he cast them out of heaven, and that was how the nation was founded. They report that there’s a magnificent island across the ocean, but honestly? I couldn’t care. I stopped talking to those people in minutes. They always act like every second is “Their time” and won’t shut up about how much better the mythical people of Priamurye (What kind of name is that?) were.</p>"

  scene_title: "Two men enter, one man leave!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uruguay has a unique history. They have two parties, lead by two invincible leaders- Lavalleja and Totally-not-Lavalleja-with-a-mustache. (Must be foreign?) Anyways, the region was totally full of vegetation, so not much interesting there. I did meet the Kuikuro, who I honestly didn’t know they existed. I thought they were just another one of Tonga’s “Mythical People” like the Kyrgyz, or the Nenets.</p>"

  scene_title: "EXPAND NDONGO"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, the African people. They are truly magnificent! I remember traveling to Zimbabwe, and apparently they had this new installation called the “Mausoleum of Halicarnassus” which was really interesting to me! I even paid a local artist to sketch me standing next to it while it looked like I was holding it up. (Sadly, I was 2 inches off and now it just looks like I’m using magical powers to hold it up instead) Ndongo, the people of the funny names, were also very welcoming as long as you didn’t mention that their name had the word “Dong” in it.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Selk’nam. Oh boy! What an amazing trip I had to their territories. They took me to one of their ceremonies where they attempted to summon a deity of some sort, and I got to watch them as they sacrificed a virgin. (Sadly, he was my intern. I promised him he’d get college credit once colleges were invented.) Other than that, their land is really cold, but their hearts are warm. I should know, they let me feel one themselves!</p>"

  scene_title: "Sami-ches"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>During my travels, I acquainted myself with the Sami. They hold a lot of territory, and can easily get a lot of potential territory. Of course, they haven’t, but that won’t stop them.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>Holy fuck, it’s the Khamugs. During my travels to Asia, I was just enjoying my stroll, when I found myself enjoying a nice dinner with the Khamug Khanate- and boy did they tell me a lot. They told me about their plans of boiling their enemies alive, of conquering all the steppes, and finally conquering all the world. Strangely, the only things they didn’t tell me was what was in their delicious stew, and where my intern Moira went.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’ve received word from an acquaintance I made during my travels in Shikoku-Korea that the Koreans have gathered a force around the city. “We will take back what’s rightfully ours!” The Koreans yelled.“OH NO YOU DON’T” a Shikoku military officer said, lighting valuable things on fire. In other news, it seems that the hose has still not been invented yet.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Pirates of Canton hold a special place in my heart, because much like my mother, their leader was a prostitute. After an “Interview” with Ching Shih herself, she admitted that she had sent some units up north to perform some non-military activities. I don’t know where they’re going, but since it’s non-militaristic in nature, it probably doesn’t matter.</p>"

  scene_title: "Fertile, but barren."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Gulf of Mexico is rich. It’s a shame the Aztecs don’t settle it. However, it seems the population meant to settle new cities was instead expended in settling rituals. The Natives also seem to have an intense allergy to something in the Western American air, as all of them have been avoiding settling that region.</p>"

  scene_title: "In the Navy!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Luckily, I was able to find a Haitian ship to take me somewhere. Unfortunately, it took me to Venezuelan waters in a non-militaristic exercise. Luckily, by escaping overboard, I was able to only sacrifice two interns to the Haitian non-military forces and get to shore.</p><p></p><p>Venezuela is great! All the wagons keep their covers down, so you can’t see the streets, but all the people were crying out in either terror or joy!</p>"

  scene_title: "A new invention."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>While escaping Venezuelan authorities, I discovered a completely-military force heading towards the Kuikuro city of Nokugu. Unfortunately for the Kuikuro, their army is composed entirely of non-military forces. Luckily, I was able to meet with the Kuikuro leaders, and I discovered they invented a unique military strategy called “Turtling,” which involves doing nothing while your enemies completely fail at attacking your cities.</p>"

  scene_title: "Two sides of a different coin."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode3-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Evenks and The Khamugs hold a steady existence. In fact, they’ve forgotten each other’s existence. The Evenks are too focused on hosting scouting conventions, and the Khamugs are too focused on plotting world domination. They’re like the classic cave-drawings I used to read in my youth, known as Pinky and the Brain.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Germans, fresh off their war with the Czech, spin the wheel of enemies and point their sword to… The other Germans! Do I expect anything to happen? No. But the sight of bloodshed is always inspiring in art! In fact, I’ve already started a poem about the war, although my publisher told me it was “disturbingly sexual,” “not appropriate,” and to “please get out of (his) house!”</p><p>Reon‘s Note: The HRE Leader changes upon entering the Classical Era; they are now lead by Ashurbanipal.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Iroquois remember their own existence, and realize how pitiful it is. Lord-Chief Hiawatha spoke to his people today. “We settle not because we can, but because we must!” He spoke. He then gave a riling speech. Meanwhile, Poverty Point leader Tahera gave a speech of their own- “The fact that we are doing nothing shows our resolve!”</p><p></p><p>EW’s Note: The Iroquois somehow adopted an Ideology, if you were wondering what that Ideology notice was doing a while back, and we have no clue which one it is, so I’m just gonna say they’re Libertarians until someone figures out what happened.</p><p>Lime’s Note: Yes, we really don’t know how they founded an ideology.

  narration: "<p>The Fall of the city of Constantine was something I got to witness personally. It wasn’t very exciting, in all honesty. The Songhai just came in, took down the flag, and started their march towards Tlemcen. Apparently battles aren’t very exciting without a military to actually fight the enemy. Whatever, I welcome the Songhai overlords!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Madagascar is quite prosperous. Boring, but prosperous. However, it doesn’t seem like it will be boring for long, as I’ve heard from Queen Ranavalona I that they’ve set their eyes on African Mainland territory! Of course, they haven’t yet, but that’s as much information as I could get before they discovered us hiding in the throne room. Yet again I had to sacrifice an intern, and the worst part was that I liked this one- he never spoke! Not once! That’s the most I could ever ask for!</p>"

I found out about this during my travel to the Great Persian Clusterfuck, where 5 civs currently meet, and it is otherwise unexciting. You’d think with 5 whole civs in one region, there’d be SOME conflict!</p>"

  narration: "<p>After traveling with a band of Qing settlers, I discovered that, despite missing their capital, the Koreans still have plenty of territory. Busan was very lovely, and Daegu was very not. The Qing settlers pointed and laughed at Daegu and said they could do better. They probably could.</p>"

  narration: "<p>While I was in Canada, I discovered their “King” was actually a Prime Minister. That’s not as important as the ongoing invasion of Canada by Iroquois forces. The Iroquois demand that the Canadians follow their ideology of doing nothing, to which Canada replied “What’s an ideology?”</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Apache are trying to start up a great North American Scoutcon. They promise there will be snacks, and that it’s totally not a trap for Poverty Point scouts to fall into.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Czechs get a moment of rest as the two German nations turn towards each other. It appears that there can only be one. And by that, I mean, there could only be 1 unit on the battlefield. There’s nobody there. Nothing. It’s a war as cold as my heart.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Cold Hearts, the Gothic bard “Thy Chemical Romance” sings tales of a black parade marching through the streets of Konigsberg. Their leader Alaric sighs, “Whatever,” he says as he approaches his army. “Let’s kill the Prussians.” Alaric’s general uninterest in the war was as evident as his general uninterest in everything else.</p>"

Ivan pleaded with his step-son to get in the carriage and be driven back to Arheimar, but unfortunately Alaric couldn’t hear his step-father over the sound of the bard “Slipknotticus.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Down where the Nile meets the rich Mediterranean, the Minoans prosper in denial. “Phaistos? Never heard of it!” They claim. Many lives were lost, yet nobody cares. They claim their newly settled canal city of Gournia is the best in the world, despite it not actually going anywhere valuable like the Red Sea.</p><p></p><p>Once I reached port in the newly Nubian city of Phaistos, things changed. Everyone had their special bows, axes, and whatever they could find that could be used as a weapon. It appears that Nubia had been declared war on three fronts- Libya, Zimbabwe, and Songhai. Libya seemed to be the only one taking it seriously, which makes sense when you consider the concept of ants only fighting other ants.</p>"

I’m sure this will lead to the spread of diplomatic relations!</p><p></p><p>… which by that I of course mean war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I received word from my intern Thomas Jones recently, who had now been living in a home with two sisters of unknown origin (Possibly Taungoo, he said, but that’s not quite right?) who adopted him to be their “brother.” It appears they had a previous adopted brother who ran away. Anyways, that’s not important. He wrote to me saying this:</p><p></p><p>“To Milord Algernon Charles Swinburne,</p><p></p><p>DEAR GOD GET ME OUT OF HERE. THESE WOMEN WON’T LET ME LEAVE, AND THERE’S A MILITARY FORCE LEAD BY CHING SHIH HERSELF ON ITS WAY HERE! YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CREDIT!! JUST LET ME LEAVE!</p><p></p><p>With Regards, Thomas Jones.”</p><p></p><p>It confused me, as the only force I know of in that area was Ching Shih’s non-military force. I figure Thomas Jones was just trying to escape to become a bard (Which he often dreamed of) and that he was just trying to escape my eventual return. Why do my interns hate me so much?</p>"

It was there they made an important announcement to me.</p><p></p><p>“Algernon, you know how me and Dick have been keeping our distance lately?” Gambu said softly.</p><p></p><p>“Yes, I presume it’s because he works a lot.” I said</p><p></p><p>“Actually,” Seddon sat down beside me, “It’s a bit harder than that.”</p><p></p><p>“What are you talking about?” I asked.</p><p></p><p>Gambu straightened up tall. “Seddon and I are declaring war.”</p><p></p><p>I was shocked.

  narration: "<p>President Totally-not-Lavalleja-in-a-mustache made an important announcement to the Uruguay people a while back. He had announced that “peace is no more, now is the time of war!” and commanded all citizens to be mobilized. Of course, this was right around election season, so Totally-not-Lavalleja-in-a-mustache won another term, after which he said, “You know what? Peace can stay for a bit more.” So now there’s a large non-militaristic force in Uruguay that’s really disappointed because they were ready for a war that didn’t happen.</p><p></p><p>In other news, the Selk’nam are weird. When they found out I was returning, they gave me an old intern of mine who I thought they sacrificed, who as it turns out was being possessed by an elder god. What makes it weird, however, is that I had already hired a new intern to replace them, so then I had to figure out an excuse to fire an elder god. Fortunately, they just sacrificed one of my other interns, so I had a spot open.</p>"

In the next world, perhaps we’ll be friends?”</p><p></p><p>My sisters immediately responded, “You failed in this world, but in ours we were queens. Death on the battlefield meant much more than cowering in a city waiting to die. We hoped we could succeed in this world where we failed in the last, but it seems to be not. You would not even be considered among one of our many siblings.”</p><p></p><p>I realize now that it is an honor to follow these women as their brother. I don’t know how I intrigued them any more than the immortal leader of the Xiang, but I clearly did. Failing without a fight is not an honor.
