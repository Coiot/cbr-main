  narration: "<p>Vihreaa delivers us another installment of the wonderful hand-drawn map. My eyes are drawn to the expansion of Maratha and Songhai, but many civs are doing well.</p><p></p><p>Except for Canada. Why did they have to be nerfed?</p>"

  narration: "<p>And as an alternative to the previous, we have the Melon Map, looking as impressive as ever. I’m so impressed with both, as while I enjoy making maps myself, they are never to the quality of these.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This week, we have Zimbabwe top of the rankings. Narrowly beating out their rivals. Through clever settlements all the way from south africa to Lake Victoria, Zimbabwe have built a stable core that has taken advantage of all available room, and a powerful military that threatens all of their neighbours. Zimbabwe are a dominating force.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>We open this part of the Battle Royale with a look at how the ongoing Shikokan-Korean war is going. Unsurprisingly, not much has developed over the past few turns, however, Shikoku’s navy is close by. Korea’s army seems much larger than last time around, so Pyongyang may be safe in Seonjo’s hands for now.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Two important city settles have been made. The Goths found Baiyara north of their existing settlements, attempting to trap Muscovy. Ivan however, anticipates this, and send a small colony of inhabitants north to found Nizhny Novgorod.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, you can hear Prussian settlers raging over yet another city spot being taken, although at least they have room to fall back on.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Qing has sent an impressive amount of civilian units towards Northern Japan, which would be perfect for the formation of a city.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Cixi in her infinite immortal wisdom, has recalled the settler. Apparently, snow is worth more than grassland in this part of China.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Apache, once predicted to be the kings of North America have fallen on hard times. Poverty Point has citadeled them, and the Aztecs are encroaching on their land through the south. It seems the only avenue of escape for Geronimo is through the Rocky Mountains.</p><p></p><p>That is if the Yupik don’t get there first.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The war between Palmyra and the Golden Horde ends.  Despite Palmyra making literally zero progress, Tokhtamysh decides to throw away Atil in the peace deal. Seeing as it has no strategic value, Zenobia burns it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The real question is who will end up settling that space when the city is gone. The Golden Horde have settlers in the region, but my money’s on the Seljuqs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>After sleeping soundly for the first few parts, the Selk’nam have awoken, attacking Paysandu. If Uruguay loses the city, it isn’t a huge loss but it is a huge gain for the Selk’nam, proving they can break out of their frigid cone.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Back in Europe, Venice has pushed back the moor attackers and look to keep Murano (although it may eventually become an exclave). They also found Ragusa on Sardinia. </p><p></p><p>I am so proud of Venice. Everyone glossed over their potential in the lead-up, and they’re finally having their place in the sun. I doubt they’ll win the BR, but they’ve been great to watch so far.</p>"

  scene_title: "Haida-ing Away"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>After what seems like an eternity, the Haida have another settler on the move. However, with the race to settle past the Rockies in the south and the Metis and Yup’ik on their land, the future looks grim for the Haida. At least they have an advantage in military over their neighbours, but that can change in an instant.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The second battle for Pyongyang rages on, with Shikoan triremes not willing to give up. Korea seems in a much better position this war, and I’d advise Shikoku to retreat. Even though the Qing aren't colonizing their Island, Korea still can.</p>"

  scene_title: "Taungoo = Taungood"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>Welcome to Southeast Asia, where Taungoo is on track to repeating Vietnam’s success in Mk2. They’ve defended their region well, and have the whole peninsula locked down. Now, however, they’ll have to choose an expansion target as the Qin are heading south and Canton has rebuilt Hong Kong in roughly the same location.</p>"

  scene_title: "Baltic Sea Wars"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we have the HRE who has been off to a great start, fighting with under-achievers the Vikings and over-achievers Prussia in a battle for the Baltic Sea. They all seem to be fighting each other, and while I don’t expect any cities to flip anytime soon, I do expect that any general commanding this area is going to have a bad time.</p><p></p><p>In the background, Venice and the Moors peace out, while the Selk’nam give up on attacking Uruguay. </p>"

  scene_title: "The third shot of Korea in 12 slides."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not much has changed here. Sakamoto has brought an extra trireme, however, the Koreans continue to defend a crucially important city for them. Only now am I noting how vulnerable Pyongyang is to sea invasions, and if Korea intends to keep this city, they’ll need a much stronger navy. Two triremes won’t cut it.</p>"

  scene_title: "Rahman’s predicament"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>So, what now Moors? Your invasion of Murano has ended in failure, but you still are one of the biggest threats in Europe. Your area is well defended, if sparsely populated and most of your military is still standing. An attack on Algeria would not go amiss, but I’d wait until the HRE attacks Venice before moving in myself.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>A few slides ago, the Minoas decided they’d attack Nubia. Now that we can see their territory and army, I have no idea why they did. Their army is disorganized and there is hardly a navy to threaten Piye’s cities. Minoa has been doomed to irrelevancy and they can’t seem to be able to accept it.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Sol del Mayo has shone brightly on Uruguay today, sending the demons of Selk’nam back to where they came. Paysandu remains Uruguayan, but I doubt the Selk’nam will stop until they take the city.</p>"

  scene_title: "Mk2 Flashbacks"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>I really don’t like seeing an Arctic civ this far south, I still have PTSD from the invasion of Canada back in Mk2. The Haida are willingly letting themselves be squashed by their neighbours and they are running out of room to expand. What could Koyah possibly be thinking?</p>"

  scene_title: "The Battle for India."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Maratha has begun attacking Hyderabad, and with so few Indian reinforcements nearby, I predict that it will fall. However, Gandhi isn’t stupid. She’s sent her massive army south from Bombay and Delhi to push into the Marathan core. I have a feeling this war will decide the future of this crowded area, and whether India will continue to do well, or be relegated to a mid-tier permanent mid-tier civ.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Algeria has nowhere to go. They’ve dodged death for a while, but time is running out for them in the game. Tagdemt and Blide are utterly surrounded by the Songhai and the Atlas Mountains. It’s a shame because I had high hopes for Algeria, but Songhai isn’t fucking around.</p>"

As he reads down his list one more time, he reflects on his travels and how lucky he was to see so much of the cylinder. At the bottom of his scroll, he writes one more sentence before heading to publish his work.</p><p></p><p>“In conclusion, I’ve discovered that people find happiness in the simple things.”</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back to the bloodshed. Apparently, I was wrong about the Shikokan invasion, as a mass of triremes has surrounded the Western docks of Pyongyang. The Koreans have put up a brave defence, however, I expect they’ll lose this city. And then they’ll be a bloody battle for who gets to keep it.</p>"

The town is peaceful, with children playing in the streets and families walking through the marketplace.</p><p></p><p>And just a sea away. Pyongyang burns.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Baltic stalemate continues, this time with notably fewer Vikings. It seems William has not followed up on his promise of peace with the Prussians, preferring to prolong this painful conflict. I hope they solve that problem soon, as the Czechs are growing stronger by the day, and I would hate for Frederick’s hard work to be taken away from him.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode7-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>South of Lake Baikal is the Khamug capital of Jadaran. The city is smaller than Ba’arin, but this is due to the nomadic Mongols spreading out across the region. Jamukha’s army is matched only by the Qing’s, and with recent declarations from Muscovy and Qing on the Evenks, he has the perfect nation to test his battle skills.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the time since we’ve last seen Minoa, they’ve lost all but one of their ships, allowed Nubia to start building a navy in response and now their capital of Phaistos is under siege. The only way things could possibly get worse is if they manage to give Malia away in the peace deal.</p><p></p><p>This what you all get for not voting for Yugoslavia.</p>"

The Seljuqs glare over the mountains at the land that could have been theirs. </p><p></p><p>The Seljuqs are not out of this by any means, however, they fight an uphill battle.

  narration: "<p>To the East of Seljuq land, Hyderabad continues to be hit by the Marathi navy. Indira hasn’t moved her forces to attack any cities, so I fear India will lose any advantage they once had. Alp Arslan would be wise to move in now.</p>"

They are a competent military-based civ with the terrain in their favour and a decent military. However, they’ve just been declared war on by their southern neighbour, and the most powerful nation in Africa, and have another extremely powerful neighbour right on their border.</p><p></p><p>Godspeed Ewuare.</p>"

  narration: "<p>What I thought would develop into an interesting conflict has sadly stagnated. Gandhi has refrained from sending her army farther south, while Shivaji has been defeated at the gates of Hyderabad.

  narration: "<p>The Ndogolese invasion has slowed considerably, due to somewhat competent defence and harsh terrain. Nzinga needs to capitalize on this option as it’s her only realistic way of expanding. I see this as some sort of trial given to her from Nyatsimba -Take Benin and prove yourself or face the might of Zimbabwe.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Nazca join in the fun, attacking Venezuela. While the terrain is still against them, at least they've committed an impressive military (featuring catapults and spearmen) to the cause. It’s a shame they’ll probably get caught in choke-points in the mountains. But I guess that’s how war goes.</p>"

That’s another five nations declaring war on him, to go with at least three more (that I've seen.)
