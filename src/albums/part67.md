  narration: "Welcome back to another edition of the Civilization V Battle Royale Mk. II, the Reddit craze over 10,000 Babylonian observers strong! I’m your host, /u/sonicnerd23. Last part was an absolute mess, as several new conflicts erupted across the cylinder that could see a good number of our major contenders fall from grace. Will this part deliver on that? Or will this be another Khanflict? Sit tight - you’re about to find out!"

  narration: "We also have our relationship chart, created weekly by /u/maserlazer! Looking at last part’s chart, no one’s satisfied with just straight up denouncement anymore, settling for wars, wars, and more wars. In the words of professional Oompa Loompa Donald J. Trump, “Sad!”"

  narration: "Here’s the weekly city map from /u/Malssistra and /u/LacsiraxAriscal! As you can see, the situation in the world has changed considerably in just this last part alone, with the Boers expanding their holdings in Europe and border gore galore in the Middle East.

  narration: "The Boers, as usual, top the Power Rankings for last part. For so long, they’ve been the undisputed masters of tech and military strength, and in these past few parts, they’ve finally been acting on their advantages, waging successful wars on the more cluttered powers of Europe. Should they keep up their momentum, they may very well have four more capitals under their belt by the end of the part! Be afraid. Be very afraid."

  narration: "Speaking of the Boers, we begin our part today with a shot of the tense Ethiopian-Boer border (boerder?). Bless Ethiopia, they’re trying their hardest to keep up with the Boers. With their blitzkrieg-like conquests of Carthage and Arabia, there’s no doubt that they’ve become a force to be reckoned with in their own right and have come a long way from their decently-sized empire in the Horn of Africa. But unfortunately, the Boers are just too far ahead tech wise for the Ethiopians to even stand a chance against them without heavy losses."

  narration: "Nuclear hellfire sweeps across the Baltics as a fleet of Swedish Advanced Destroyers launch a naval assault, retaking Helsinki and encroaching on Espoo. The war between the Swedes and the Finns has so far seen Sweden coming out on top. For how much longer this Swedish success will continue is dubious, however. Finnish forces lie within striking distance of Helsinki, and meanwhile, the Swedes are still at war with the Boers, who are drawing ever nearer towards their core."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene09.jpg'
  narration: "Zooming out from the frontlines, TPang gives us a shot of the Swedish core, which is surprisingly only lightly defended. Either the Swedes have already sent too many men into the meat grinder, the combined Finnish-Boer aerial bombardment has eviscerated their land forces before they could even reach the frontlines, or both. In either case, this is not good news for Sweden. Navally, however, the Swedes appear to be in a far better position, with a massive fleet of Arsenal Ships, Carriers, and Advanced Destroyers off the Norwegian coast. Unfortunately, this is pretty moot, seeing as how their war against the Finns and Boers is being primarily fought on land, but hey, it’s gotta count for something… right?"

  narration: "The Balkan front continues to be a sweep for Team FinnBoer, as a team of Boer XCOMs easily steamrolls through Swedish defenses. Finland retakes Constantinople from Sweden, cockblocking their Boer allies from sniping a capital for themselves. Finland are even seeing some successes in Anatolia in their war against the Sibir Khanate, as Finnish forces swamp the Sibir garrisons at Tigranocerta and Gyumri. Meanwhile, the terrified, technologically-inferior forces of the Armenians gaze on in horror at the carnage unfolding around them."

  narration: "Going deeper into the Middle East, we can see that just as the Finnish-Sibir front there is heating up, so too is the Vietnamese-Sibir front. It’s clear that Vietnam haven’t completely disregarded their recent conquests in what was Persia, stocking the hangers of Pasargardae with Drone Fighters galore. Already, several Sibir cities on this front sit in the red from repeated aerial bombardment. However, the mountains and hills in this part of the world will make it hard for Vietnamese forces to launch any sort of direct assault, and the Khanate’s forces are still too carpeted on this front for Vietnamese paratroopers to land near any cities."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene12.jpg'
  narration: "In fact, the Eastern Front has ground to a bloody stalemate thanks to the rocky terrain. Several cities are low in health - most notably Khost and Samarquand, which both look likely to flip a few times - but both sides are fielding enough forces to continue grinding away at each other indefinitely. Such is what happens when an unstoppable force (Vietnam) meets an immovable object (Sibir). Meanwhile, the Knights of the Maond Table survey the scene, one knight in particular annoying a group of Sibir forces on the way to Urgench."
- scene_number: 13

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene13.jpg'
  narration: "The Sibir-Finnish War, by contrast, has the potential to be a lot more mobile. As a column of tanks and VERTOL units descend on Moscow and Kiev, Finnish forces scramble to put together a sizable defense force. However, sandwiched between two hostile powers, their chances do not seem good. God, if they aren’t tenacious, though; their bombers are doing a number on Sibir cities close to the front and they’ve even sent a crack team of XCOMs and Paratroopers to seize Tashkent. It seems Kekkonen, taking a page from the Maori, has decided to go out swinging."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene14.jpg'
  narration: "The Second Great Pacific War continues, albiet modestly. There doesn’t seem to be much substantial fighting between Vietnam and Australia. Things are far from over, granted - Panduranga is shockingly close to having no health while scuffles continue near Cebu, Vigan, and Iloilo - but it seems that with both powers preoccupied with other major wars, this front is secondary to them at the moment… oh, yeah, and the Blackfoot are still there. Somehow I keep forgetting they have an outpost this far out even though I was the guy who narrated the part where they sniped it from the Champa. Go figure."

  narration: "Finally, Brazil finally breaks through the Chilean lines north of Concepcion. What remains of the Chilean army retreats south to their four remaining cities. Folks, we may be witnessing the end of Chile. The only thing in the way of their final demise at the hands of Brazil is, quite literally, Australia. Unless Brazil gets open borders with Australia, they will be forced to embark troops into waters where Chile (shockingly enough) still has the naval advantage. It will be a bloody endeavor, but should Brazil wish to see it through to the end, they will have finally rid South America of their centuries-old rival."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene16.jpg'
  narration: "North of South America, the walls are steadily closing in on Mexico. As Australian forces continue fighting for their coastal cities, Mexico is surprisingly (or not so surprisingly, considering the amount of fallout that now blankets Mexican territory) having a difficult time with Texas, of all civs. However, to be fair to Mexico, Texas is also struggling. Their capital, Austin, now sits at 0 health while Laredo isn’t faring much better. What’s left of their once-impressive carpet (for a former city state) is making a bloody push for Mexico City. It’s a bold gamble on Sam Houston’s behalf; should he succeed, Texas will forever go down in CBR history as the city-state that broke free of its classification in a daring, opportunistic declaration of war. But should he fail, Texas will likely end up eliminated in a blaze of glory… Actually, scratch that gamble part, it’s a win-win situation, if you ask me."

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene17.jpg'
  narration: "As Australian Japan continues to burn in a nuclear hell, the Koreans just… sit there. At this point, we know that Korea is more than capable of bringing the hurt on powerful civs. They blitzed Vietnam, taking a huge chunk of their northern territory. They blitzed Mongolia and Yakutia, taking huge swathes of their territory. Heck, in the one war Korea had against Australia, they were able to hold their own, and that was against an Australia who completely had their attention on them. Right now while Australia is distracted would be the perfect time for Korea to strike."
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene18.jpg'
  narration: "Once again, the war between Yakutia and the Inuit has ground into a stalemate. Seriously, there are more Finnish ground units in this shot than there are from either the Inuit or the Yakuts! Perhaps it’s understandable why Yakutia has such low military manpower, as they lost most of it against Korea and most of what remains is fighting Mongolia and Sibir. But the Inuit? They have no excuse. Right now, they are at war with no other nearby neighbor but the Yakuts. With their army, their navy, and their canal city of Iglooik, they should be advancing on Jokusai by now!"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "On second thought… where is the Inuit military? These are cities that are closer to their core, so you’d expect there’d be more land forces here, but most of the Inuit units I see in this shot are workers or naval. This could be bad for them; should they decide to go to war with a stronger power, the Blackfoot could easily take the opportunity to swoop in and do some major damage to these cities. Then again, considering the Inuits’ outrageous production, they could just as easily pump out an army for these territories should a scenario like that occur."
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene20.jpg'
  narration: "Here we see the Inuit city of… *sigh* Pasadena. As is known by now, the Inuit have founded so many cities at this point that they’ve run out of their own city names and started borrowing names from other civs in the game, resulting in ironic cities like this. But I digress. It seems there is no corner of the cylinder safe from the carnage of the Second Great Pacific War, as a Vietnamese paratrooper squares off against an Australian Bazooka unit on the outskirts of Pasadena. There goes the neighborhood."

  narration: "It seems my hunch was right that Yakutia’s military was primarily focused on the Mongols. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like they’ll be able to push through with all those Boer units in the way. Though he himself still has a substantial military, Genghis Khan has lost a considerable number of cities to Korea, Finland, and Yakutia. His best bet at the moment would be to make peace with his enemies - particularly, those who are actually bombing his cities to rubble and not so much the Blackfoot - and carpet up again so that he can hopefully last until he reaches the end of the tech tree with everyone else."
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene22.jpg'
  narration: "Meanwhile, a lone Finnish Machine Gun garrison bravely defends Khoro, the only thing keeping it safe from the wrath of Sibir being the thin line of Mongol hexes next to Mandalgovi. Should Sibir actually manage to break through the stalemate at Amga, things are going to get real confusing real quick between the Yakut, Sibir, and Finnish forces flipping cities left and right."
- scene_number: 23

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene23.jpg'
  narration: "A lone Canadian destroyer wanders the North Sea, trying to navigate through the massive carpets of ships from both Sweden and Iceland. Looking at this screenshot, I feel like, were Sweden not preoccupied with a Boer problem right now, they could probably take a few British Isle cities off of Iceland. Iceland’s land carpet in this area of the cylinder is not looking as intimidating as it once was, and by the looks of things, a lot of their ships are Carriers which couldn’t hope to stand up to the massive fleet of Advanced Destroyers at their door. Perhaps to make up for their ally’s’ meager defenses, Australia has based a number of its units in Ireland and Cornwall."
- scene_number: 24

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene24.jpg'
  narration: "HOLY FINNISH COUNTEROFFENSIVE, BATMAN! Proving they’re not out of the game just yet, Finland launches a massive assault against both Sweden and Sibir, retaking their capital and putting pressure on Sibir. Unfortunately for them, this will probably do little to deter the massive wave of Sibir troops poised to strike right outside of Moscow and Kiev, but it’s very clear that the war is just getting started."
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene25.jpg'
  narration: "On the Scandinavian front, a group of Finnish units applies pressure to the longtime Swedish city of Turku while Swedish Advanced Destroyers stand by for another strike at Helsinki. Both forces are weakened considerably, but I wouldn’t say that neither has the advantage over the other. Currently, Finland has a greater number of strong melee units on the frontline. Should they continue to apply pressure to Turku and defend their capital, they may eventually be able to come out on top."
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene26.jpg'
  narration: "Similarly, their prospects on the Anatolian front look good. They have taken Tigranocerta, and with minimal Sibir reinforcements in sight, Finnish hold on the peninsula looks almost absolute. Meanwhile, a brave Swedish tank launches an incursion into Ohrid and manages to retake it from the Boers. Judging by the growing Boer forces outside Messene, it doesn’t look like this Swedish counterassault will hold up for that much longer."
- scene_number: 27

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene27.jpg'
  narration: "The Siberian front, on the other hand, looks to swing the way of Sibir. Though the corridor of Finnish cities sticks like a knife into the heart of Sibir, look at all those units! As more Sibir units pour in from the north, Kekkonen is going to have a considerably harder time defending this corridor - doubly so if Kuchum Khan decides to use that nuclear weaponry"
- scene_number: 28

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part67-scene28.jpg'
  narration: "Look at all those nuked tiles! Nuclear weapons continue to rain from the skies, transforming the Siberian wastelands into just that - wastelands. No doubt, this is the most devastating war that has swept through Europe yet. Based on the amount of cities sitting at 0 health, it seems fair to say that this devastation isn’t likely to stop any time soon. It’s screenshots like this that make a man question the morality of killing millions of virtual people in a computer simulation."
- scene_number: 29

  narration: "Sweden appears similarly devastated, its core cities heavily pillaged from atomic fire. This will definitely hamper Sweden’s production, thus hurting their war effort. Meanwhile, the Norwegian subjects of the Swedish Empire, as of yet unaffected by the brutality of the war, sleep soundly and remember a day in which they weren’t a part of a warmongering civilization."

  narration: "Almost immediately after retaking Cebu and Caloocan, Vietnam loses them to Australian Advanced Destroyers, along with the mainland city of Vigan. This is bad for Vietnam. Slowly but surely, they’re running out of naval defenses while Australia just keeps sending in more and more from their massive carpet of death in the Pacific. If Vietnam, beleaguered with their war against Sibir, doesn’t make peace with Australia soon, they could very well start to lose some of their most valuable coastal cities. Meanwhile, realizing that there’s no way he’ll ever be able to fight a naval war again, Benito Juarez gives up on his ambitions for conquering the last Hawaiian island."

Enemies of Tibet beware: it’ll be slightly more difficult to eliminate them now! Meanwhile, the Vietnamese units surrounding the city-state give a hearty chuckle at the news before getting back to work looking intimidating"

  narration: "There’s Vietnam’s navy! It was over in the Indian Ocean the entire time! As Vietnam sends more embarked units into the meatgrinder at Borneo, one wonders why it isn’t over there helping repel Australian naval forces. It would behoove Vietnam to get open borders with the Kimberley as soon as possible so they can- Wait, they have a canal city at Mandalay? Then why aren’t they sending more naval forces?!\nMeanwhile, a Buccaneer frigate navigates the Indonesian isles. I’m gonna go ahead and assume that’s the Black Pearl en route for Singapore so that the crew on board can get the charts needed to find their friend Jack Spar-oh wait, I forgot that nobody really liked the third movie."

  narration: "The World Congress passes an embargo against Iceland, making their sparse military situation all the more difficult to remedy. And as we can see in this screenshot, the situation isn’t much better in their French territories than in the British Isles. Australian and Finnish forces outnumber the amount of land forces in this part of the Icelandic Empire, and they’re currently fighting a WAR in Icelandic territory! Iceland needs to carpet up and fast, before their neighbors take advantage of their predicament."

  narration: "Brazil indeed presses on in their war against Chile, taking Valdivia with a paratrooper. This is bad for Chile; the only melee unit they have left is the Marine unit stationed outside of Valdivia. Once that unit is finished, there is nothing stopping Brazil from taking at least the final two cities on the Southern Cone… except for the mountainous terrain which makes the cities only approachable by sea… and the remaining Chilean naval units which will make any embarked assault hell… and the lack of Brazilian naval units with which to support their embarked assau-You know what, never mind. There is a lot that could stop Brazil from any further Chilean gains."

  narration: "Unfortunately for Sibir and Sweden, the other embargo on the World Congress’ agenda - the one against Finland - was rejected. Also pictured is a considerable contingent of the Brazilian military in the Siberian wastes for whatever reason. Either they’re gearing up to snipe some random city from Finland, Sibir, or Mongolia or they’re just visiting Yakutia because they want to see the Great Wall. Either way - Guys, Chile’s the other way."

  narration: "This screenshot looks like something from a cyberpunk novel: A lone soldier dressed in the attire of a military class long faded from the collective consciousness wanders the technologically-swamped streets of a futuristic city, unaware that there is a major power out there that wants him dead. I’m not sure what exactly Krueger‘s problem is with the Knights of the Maond Table and their affiliated Chinese units. Perhaps he realizes that even if he’s number one in the Power Rankings, he’ll never be the meme epicenter of the CBR and wishes to rectify that."

  narration: "Semiramis uncovers a more relevant plot, revealing that the Inuit look to finish what Chile and the Blackfoot started and eliminate Hawaii. Such a war would be a walk in the park for them, but I don’t believe they’ll actually go through with it. After all, they’d eliminate a civ and suffer the warmonger penalties that would go with it, invoking the ire of… Well, no one that could do any massive damage to them in the long run. I suppose there’s no real downside after all."

The Buccaneers have managed to take Guadalajarrrrra again and have sent a Paratrooper north to hopefully slip into a weakened Ciudad Juarrrrrrez. Will it happen? Probably not, but hey - it could just be that my eyes are being fooled by the copious amounts of carriers around their core, but did the Buccs build more land units? It’s a step in the right direction, at least."

Expanding the Finnish corridor, they’ve managed to beat back Sibir forces from the north. Meanwhile, they continue to fight tooth and nail in their core territories, retaking Helsinki for the umpteenth time and checking a Sibir offensive just outside of Tampere. It may just be that Finland ends up coming out of this with more gains than losses."

  narration: "Oops, spoke too soon. Sweden makes another push forward again, retaking Adrianople and Constantinople, as well as Helsinki and Espoo offscreen. Also, by the looks of things, they’re gearing up for a counterattack against the Boers. This confrontation right here might decide the outcome of the game. The Boers have grown powerful not entirely because of their military might, but also due to circumstance. Because they were more technologically advanced than their neighbors, they were able to blitz right in with the full brunt of their military. But here, they’re fighting against a technologically-advanced civ far away from Africa with only XCOMs, Paratroopers, and Chimeras."

If they fail, then the Boers eventually come to dominate all of Europe, and with it, its production, making them practically insurmountable. If they, succeed, however, they free Europe from threat of outside invasion… At least until the Boers try again."

The dedication the Vietnamese are bringing to this war is certainly admirable, but these cities will likely flip back to the Australians next turn. The Australians continue to threaten the former Champa capital Panduranga, but now, looking at this screenshot, we can also tell that another Champa city, Kauthara is being softened up for an invasion as well. Vietnam had better watch out."

It honestly surprises me that they haven’t taken advantage of the chaos in Mexico yet. They could very easily make gains that would further build their insane levels of production (hinthint: PETRA) and set themselves up for further conquest southwards.

There’s a lot that can be said for a civ who knows how to use Paratroopers to capture cities multiple tiles away from their own territory, especially one that’s in such dire straits as Afghanistan.\nWhat would be interesting right now is if Armenia jumped on board the Sibir hate train. They have a (narrow) window of opportunity ala Texas in which they can easily capture one to three cities if they maneuver their forces just right, and with the massive amount of Finnish/Vietnamese/Afghani coalition forces in the area, it is likely that they would be able to hold these cities. Will Armenia make a comeback?"

By the looks of things, Finland’s AI is working in tandem with both the Vietnamese and the Afghanis to ensure the defeat of Sibir, launching raids and incursions on the Eastern Front to make things easier for the latter two… Or it could just be their AI wanting more exclaves.

Also, surprisingly, Vietnam has not made a move for Artashat there, even though one of their workers has ended up on a tile right next to the city, saving a spot for a paratrooper.

Miraculously for Afghanistan, Sibir still has not managed to send in enough forces to take Kabul.

Their latest attempt at actual expansion against Sri Lanka was thoroughly cockblocked by Australia, essentially locking them down to their home base in former Indonesian territory for the forseeable future.
