  narration: "Hellooo Fellow Armchair Generals and other bloodthirsty fans who love
    the sight of dead empires and razed cities, and of course the glory of seeing
    all but one of the 61 civilizations fight each other for supremacy on the most
    beautiful of all planets, Earth! (Now slowly becoming more toxic as the world
    fills with smoke from past Hunnic city razings). \nI am /u/Professor-Reddit and
    igraciously accept the offer from our glorious founding father and megaoverlord
    /u/TPangolin to narrate this episode! As always, it would be awesome for anybody
    who hasn‘t already to subscribe to /r/Civbattleroyale so that we can all collectively
    enjoy the great maps, Polandball comics, more maps, statistic porn and other forms
    of awesomeness that floods the subreddit each day! LET THE GAMES BEGIN! (or continue
    as we left off)."

  narration: "Our brave Babylon recruit Em who is secretly working deep in the underground
    rooms of the Kremlin has found out that a drunk Stalin after having 6 bottles
    of Vodka ordered his troops to go on vacation in South-East Asia. \nTo do this
    he has planned a botched invasion in which thousands of drunk Vodka ridden Soviet
    soldiers will build an enormous tunnel leading to Rangoon and invade the empire
    from there! He executed all generals who said that it would be impossible. Unfortunately
    these generals had a distaste for Vodka and now Stalin has pretty incompetant
    officers in their place. \nWhile this drama unfolds, Burma still hasn‘t done anything
    against Vietnam other than being target practice for volunteers defending the
    walls of Vijaya. In fact I wonder if the Trung Sisters even still remember that
    they at war with them in the first place. This war is irrelevant just like Burma.
    I spy with my little eye something beginning with ‘S‘. If you guessed Spearman
    you are correct, there is one just by the capital. Wow... NEXT!"

  narration: "It seems that with the brilliant and cunning help of Fyodar Ushakov
    the Carthagians should easily be able to clear out Antium without loosing a single
    ship! Because that was actually true. Fyodar was Russia‘s most illustrious Naval
    Commander and he never ever lost a ship under his command nor a battle. Thank
    you Wikipedia. \nAssuming this, Sparta stands no chance... Which would be true
    if Sparta was accidentally Ashanti. Nevertheless Antium is on the verge of been
    taken while reinforcements arrive on land and Ayyuuuuuuuuuuubid Scouts set up
    camps on the Italian peninsular dreaming of potentially becoming that Polish Scout
    but realising that to do so you need to camp on a choke point, Silly Saladin...
    Of note: ”Maria! We have a great opportunity to take Rome before reinforcements
    arrive! Should be dispatch a large fleet to take it? We can do a Bilma here!”
    “Meh, let‘s just party at Funchal and wait while the Carthagians loose some triremes
    and units.” Either Lazy Portugal yet again or a potentially Wise Portugal. Your
    pick!"

  narration: |-
    England has a made Peace with Ireland! Big news! Now Elizabeth will have to complement being just purely England and not (most of) Wales and Cornwell too! Big victory for Ireland too, they didn‘t do much on the northern front and they lost plenty of units but taking Nottingham enables a great edge on England and further squizes that little turtle back into his shell. And now she will have to deal with a channel owned by France, herself and Ireland and the sea route through to Hastings means passing through one tile owned by Ireland unless you go overland a bit. Also, York is almost empty of units defending. Come on Napoleon...
    And while this happens, Hitler can go blitzkrieg through Northern France, take back his beloved Cologne and sweep through France in 3 weeks thus help in easing the Lebensraum crisis because seriously... It‘s getting really crowded now. Meanwhile on the other side of the planet, Japan and Mongolia declare their love for eachother. But this is Battle Royale so this doesn‘t mean much unless they plan to work together in overthrowing their Babylonian watchers.

  narration: In revenge for loosing past wars to the Ayyyyyy‘s Ethiopa has taken revenge
    by building 3 citadels all the way up to Baalbek and Aswan. Whether or not this
    was here before i don‘t know but at least Haile‘s (Ethiopia) anger is somewhat
    dealt with one citadel at a time. Interesting to note that Arabia has open borders
    with Israel. King David (Israel) must always be cautious, least a long awaited
    and ridiculously easy invasion occurs which won‘t last long. I had faith in Israel
    at first, but he should stop doing god know‘s what and build UNITS!!!

  narration: "Buccaneer triremes hold off against Mayan ships but something else mysteriously
    looms. Polynesian warriors are marching in great numbers throughout Latin America,
    or more importantly the Mayans. If the Bucs or Texas continue fighting (haha not
    really likely right now) the Polynesians might shield them. Either that or they
    are plotting... Commiserating. Silently discussing future plans in utmost secret.
    Or it could just be that they like the vacation sites there god damnit! \nWhy
    are we always so suspicious about these completely explainable events! I mean
    come on! Haven‘t we all seen other countries send their soldiers to other sovereign
    nations fully armed, fully primed and constantly on alert and setting up camps
    and emplacements across the countryside?! Anyone?!"

  narration: "Jandamarra (Kimberley) decided to prove to Henry Parkes (Australia)
    just how cool he was at DOW‘ing people and asserting military superiority. Problem
    is is that he mistook the Indonesians for Timurids. Henry Parkes was quick to
    take note and reportedly laughed so loud in his nice Lodge™ that people as far
    away as Darwin heard him. \nNeedless to say Jandamarra was upset and felt bullied.
    A little peak at Australia‘s Grand Wobbegong Armada as well. It also seems that
    it is indeed stopping the boats as intended! Although not even the most advanced
    Babylonian satellites have determined exactly what is happening to those caught
    up by the armada. It all seems to be ‘Operational on-water matters‘ according
    to a former minister for women and ‘captain caller‘ who shall not be named."

  narration: "The city of Bundaberg in all it‘s glory! The settlers have always been
    quite intrigued by the Maoi rocks that would have belong to Polynesia but who
    have never actually visited the island! Plus the island should rightfully and
    realistically belong to Chile but those guys still don‘t have caravels! It has
    always been of massive debate in Asutralia about this. \nTalks of ‘a force unknown
    to man must be behind this‘ ‘I think it must be one of those weird looking mysterious
    ocean going babylonians!‘ and “Maybe it was a message sent by a mysterious super-god
    with untold powers who is watching us and setting up events and gatherings to
    watch down upon us and who hangs out on those weird looking black Babylonian ships
    every Sunday and Wednesday!” this last one angered many Australians citing the
    100% atheist population, as a result the man who made this hypothesis was ‘punished‘
    by being thrown into a giant tub of vegemite, it should be noted that many people
    do not consider this ‘punishment at all‘. The United States and Blackfoot are
    also now friends. Babylonians are angered by these movements of pacifism and want
    more violence."

  narration: Another incite into the dark continent. I can see why Babylonians always
    say ‘hmpf‘ and walk away. Nothing much happening other than some of those Polynesians
    moving further south wanting to experience the jungles of Cambodia infamous for
    their rum running hideouts by Buccaneers hiding from Brazilians and Incan patrols.

  narration: |-
    And boom! There goes the Second War of Really Tight Mountain Passes! The Timid Timurids already have the upper hand but this is a 1 tile passage. All Armenia needs to do is pull a ‘300‘ with ranged units behind and just fight. This might result into a lawsuit between Sparta and Armenia but Tridates just needs to worry a little more about his fleet in the Caspian more I think.
    Not having control of it would enable Amphibious landings by the Timurids which could be disastrous if left unchecked and if enough units land.

  narration: ScoutCon 1360 is going well. However attendance does feel a little less
    as Finish and Mongolian scouts leave citing boredness and yet again Israeli hosting.
    It should also be noted that the once unbeatable Yakutian carpet is also thinning
    out.

  narration: And boom second DOW! But let‘s hope that Mirwais Hotak is more prepared.
    If he learnt his lesson last time then Afghanistan will certainly become the graveyard
    of the Timurid empire or at least just a city or 2. I‘m loving these actually
    relevant wars! Aren‘t you guys?

  narration: "Ferdinand Magellan is now looking at helping out the Icelandish a bit
    now! He will personally lead an Icelandic expedition to the Orient in search of
    a western trade route for Iceland to follow. \nWhether the mutinies start to get
    boring and repetitive and whether he will die in the Philippines in a battle depends
    of course. Iceland is also adopting a strategy I normally do when defending strategically
    (or not) placed civs, defend the only ways to get to your empire and have spare
    reservists stationed a fair distance from eachother in the remote unclaimed/semi-safe
    areas. And have big navies. I feel like the AI is evolving. Unfortunately the
    year 1360BCE is not when Terminator is released :("

  narration: Aha! Here is what we have been waiting for! Texan troops have regrouped
    and are charging at Mexico city! Austin angered so many people Mexico is dead
    meat! If Texas can surround the city with shear strength and attack with shear
    force, then Mexico will certainly have some nice painful and agonising peace terms
    the like of Versailles. Rest assured, poor old Sam Houston now has a capital to
    rebuild... completely. 2 pop is 6,000 people. 26 pop (what they started off with)
    is about 9.5 million... HOLY SHI-! What the fuck happened?! Did the Reapers from
    Mass Effect 3 arrive briefly and just casually commit a galactic genocide (and
    left coinciding with the Mexicans?!) So many conspiracies!

  narration: "Ouchie ouch Ashanti ain‘t having a nice day today at all! Kongo just
    took Atebubu, with two cities left Tutu is fucked. But I can‘t stop noticing Kumasi.
    Did the Kongo go in, attack and just leave? \nAccording to the latest war map
    Morocco is just at war with Ashanti and Kongo. Malian horseman and a Boer scout
    blocks the road to Kumasi and Kongo has naval superiority so either tutu saw a
    quick attack on Kumasi with superior force before the Malians closed in (unlikely)
    or Kongo just saw a nice west African colony to take was available. Either way
    Morocco‘s prize of war from the Kongo is slowly shifting from his grasp so it
    was good while it lasted."

  narration: Enlightened Brazilians from across the empire all celebrate a new era
    in world history! Perhaps this era will turn the dark continent into a great centre
    of culture, art and science! But in the meantime, a large convoy of Argentine
    soldiers march northwards seemingly to inflict some revenge on the Bucs. Henry
    Morgan will have a delightful day ahead in more well paying fight scenes for future
    movie directors.

  narration: Brazil takes back! But will it last? Or more importantly, will they even
    capture Cartagena? Again more fight scenes for Henry Morgan! Brazil loves those
    beautiful stalemates so much! Even if Pedro succeeds, it won‘t last long. Buccaneer
    reinforcements are all around Port Royal the capital so it won‘t last long at
    all.

    Feyodar Ushakov was a genius! So much so that he must of taken the city without
    the Babylonians noticing! Damnit TPang! I feel like a detective doing detective
    work on finding out what did Sparta do with the Byzantines, where did they go?!

    of Balistas hiding from Spartan dominince in Anatolia! \nUnsurprisingly, inspired
    Babylons have watched it making the movie a major box office success on board
    the submarines! I just find this so sad however. And what will happen if the open
    borders isn‘t renewed? Seriously though, these soldiers must be really loyal to
    the empire! Especially after Ceasar‘s massive orgy death at the hands of Leonidas
    I himself and the fall of the empire. We need constant updates from our satellites
    about the movements of these brave fighters! What will happen I  dare ask?"

    indeed but Armenian troops line the coast watching out. Meanwhile Timid Timurid
    pikemen are at the gates to Bukhara so watch out! Also I thought Yakutia just
    signed peace with the Timurids and wrote a full blown 300 word satire report below
    about it before realising that it was the sword animation (signalling war) fading
    out periodically. \nI‘M TRYING TOO HARD TO NARRATE THIS!!! I DEMAND A FORMAL WAGE

    forget, the Sioux resettle their old city of Itazipcho again. Meanwhile Henry
    Morgan invited Eva Peron over to Port Royal and despite her defiance to being
    offered Rum to drink she eventually conceded and after more drinking and dating
    she eventually drunkenly signed a peace treaty. Ever since that day she will forever
    protest and strenously deny she ever made a deal with a pirate or have a friendly
    conversation with him. \nBut of course Pirates never forget. They know the truth
    she doesn‘t want other people to hear that she commited a humiliating ‘sin‘ in
    Argentina."

  narration: "Texas has made peace with the Inuit. There might have been a chance
    that the Inuit go through Blackfoot territory to fight Texas but it didn‘t happen.
    Also these wars must mean Sam Houston is considered a warmonger which is stupid.
    Sam was invaded by the US and Mexico and took Baltimore. Another war with Canada
    gave them a free Philidelphia and now a free Puebla. These guys face against all
    odds but they still loose their capitals in a double city flip! \nAlso I think
    Lincoln is secretly supporting Texas in helping him win the BR with both of these
    cities eventually finding their way to Houston‘s doorsteps. More conspiracies!
    Texan forces are having a massive difficulty taking the city, many units are massively
    damaged and that army which was seemingly going to take Mexico City just left
    and headed back to Houston. What?! Talk about retribution! “Hey guys let‘s go
    take our revenge on Mexico for committing genocide against Austin and allying
    themselves with a massive, ancient galactic synthetic race of machines and murdering
    9.5 million people! In the midst of fighting!” And then 2 turns later give up...

  narration: "The Grand Wobbegong Armada has taken Quezon! This opens up attack to
    mainland Phillipines and Butuan! Taking Butuan would open the front lines even
    more for the Aussies and will really tear them up. While there is a big threat
    of overextension by the Aussies there are still plenty of reserves at Pangasinan
    forcing their way up the coast to Quezon. No matter what happens, Pangasinan is
    definitly staying Australian for a looong time. Sorry Rizal but you better sign
    peace now. Or else Australia is going to snowball dramatically. \nAnd with these
    ridiculously OP ships now I mean SNOWBALL HARD!!!! Woo! Hey... Is it ok as narrator
    for being a little bias (or a lot?) I do have the power to effectively change

  narration: Whoah ok! Lazy Portugal maybe no more? Sneaky Maria sniping the prize!
    Might not last long but it shows the war spirit that is Maria and her stupid political
    decisions that contribute an enormous amount to Babylonian comedy and media. It
    should be noted however that Carthage has been booted out by Portugal as a result
    so Sparta will have to deal with this himself. Also just noticed that Spartan
    city at the base of Italy near Antium. Hmm Sparta is Spartanizing the Former Roman
    Empire just like what Rome did to all of it‘s provinces. Oh the irony!

  narration: A very detailed account from Recruit Em‘s about Stalin‘s plans for Socialism
    In One Country and how it is going! Almost a secret plot every 2 turns! Man, Em
    really is good! Either that or Stalin is onto us and is feeding us lies. Godamnit
    Stalin! Stop using your NKVD against us and instead focus on those damn Huns when
    sending them to the artic Gulag camps! Whatever he is doing (drinking more vodka
    it seems) I am stunned by just how many plots he has in storage now! The Kremlin
    must be full of these ‘top secret‘ documents of Stalin‘s plans hidden underneath
    in those secret tunnels and rooms! Fascinating.

  narration: Phillipine forces in a surprising twist recapture Quezon and slightly
    push back the Australians. But not for long. While we might need to say goodbye
    to that poor Caravel slight northwards the Aussies have an enormous backlog of
    ships tying back all the way to modern day Port Moresby! You know when bad things
    are gonna happen when a fleet extending several (IRL) thousand kilometres all
    densely packed is heading your way. Also note the Aussie settlers in the bottom
    left. I think it is pretty clear now of Henry Parkes‘ plans. Also Kimberley‘s
    are just standing back and watching. Do something Jandamarra! Quick! Capitalise
    on this war!

  narration: "A nice look at the frozen people up north. A relatively strong expansive
    empire with surprisingly good core cities (for these frozen lands) and a strong
    navy can only mean good things for these people. Although I can‘t stop noting
    those ships in the Arctic, I think the Inuit think we are hiding far up north
    and are hunting for our Sub! Haha good luck Inuits! I think Chile is a lot closer
    to us but do keep looking! And please don‘t kill those poor seals as you hunt
    for us :( I like Seals... And war. Lots of war. \nOh wait sorry! TPang specially
    highlighted a new city on the screen. My mistake! Oh yes, and uh... Yeah a new
    city guys in Inuit lands! Pretty cool uh? I know! Very impressive 2 food and a
    river?! Fascinating.\nTPang‘s note: I was mainly pointing that city out because
    it‘s evident that the Inuit have settled SO many cities that they‘ve burnt through
    their entire city list."

    border that will make the power rankers happy. The Kimberley also fittingly hire
    a Portuguese Navigator by the name of Henry to guide them in their age of discovery.
    Needless to say Maria is not pleased... Notable lack of land units on the interior.
    Seems like the fear of the wildlife and living conditions is preventing all out
    war, well there you go! Also with the Indonesian Galleases and triremes carpet,
    Kimberley might have a more immediate threat in his way. Regardless, taking down
    Indonesia will make his position far more formidable in diplomacy. \nDon‘t underestimate,
    trireme and galleas carpets can be scary especially at your back door. Luckily
    Kimberley does have a fairly formidable navy."

  narration: |-
    In the far reach of the south pacific Australian settlers set sail seeking a new life in the hopes of aiding in the growth and eventual snowball that is Australia. As a nation that slowly encroaches eastward towards the dark continent, settling cities along the way and building warships at breakneck speeds, one must wonder who in South America can catch up to this naval giant and carve a city in a part of the South Pacific for themselves.
    “Rule, Australia! Rule the waves! Aussies never will be slaves.” Elizabeth was considering a lawsuit because of this but promised that she will wait until she gets Ship of the lines which might take a little while for her. Oh and yeah, Quezon is ours again. Flipping won‘t last long... trust me, I think. We all remember Bilma don‘t we all.

  narration: Peace has been achieved! While Mexico was probably not going to turn
    the tables just yet if not at all Texas despite gaining Puebla will have to recover
    for a long time. Their army didn‘t take the greatest beating, but loosing your
    capital is a humiliation and sign of weakness. The 9.5 million people will be
    remembered for centuries to come but the pain will still live on for sure. Austin
    might not ever fully recover to it‘s former glory as being the baby capital of
    the world and for being one of the main reasons how Texas had such a massive pop.
    Mexico hit Texas where it hurt most.

    who‘s the real threat. The city of Geelong is also relatively undefended and easy
    pickings and the frigate over there is taking a beating but the fact that it is
    completely undamaged is saying a lot. Rizal did a good job initially holding off
    the Champans, Aussies, Japanese, Hawaians and Kimberley at roughly the same time
    but still loosing cities but now it is critical. He has lost or lost at one point
    numerous cities (even his core cities) even having a couple Champan ships shoot
    at Manila a little bit and this weakness is deepening himself more and more and
    more into a big sad hole. I know he can pull himself out but only if he survives
    this first. Oh hey! And if you follow that cursor in the bottom left you get to
    see those nice delicious fishes the Kimberley regularly fetch! \nApparently the
    Babylons have yet to discover sailing... What about Nuclear Fission, Telecommunications,
    Atomic Theory and Electronics, researched that Nebuchadnezzar II? Was this sub
    you have, secretly stolen from IRL and then time travelled back to 4000 BCE in
    another dimension? Even more Conspiracies! We need a sub for this now I think,

    and an Australian caravel meet. The captains agree to meet ashore and share luxuries
    at Hilo and try to avoid the huddled masses of many millions of polynesians on
    just a small island there. The Yakuts enjoyed hearing the stories of the wildlife
    and the joys of colonising islands rightfully belonging to Polynesia and the Aussies
    were intrigued by the doctrine of the Yakut people of declaring stupid wars of
    no importance and in the meantime hunt for bears in the Far East with their cool
    new boomsticks. Meanwhile the crews of the ships show eachothers weapons and even
    fire a few of them angering locals since they don‘t have caravels. After the 3
    day hangabout the Australians had to leave and resume their mission not before
    telling the Yakutians of the city of Bunderberg and it‘s nearby mysteries. The
    Yakutian captain is skeptical but curious if true and vows to see it for himself
    and also leaves port destined for this ‘island‘.

  narration: "Oh hello little children, I see you and Poland still have a couple spearman
    running about AND WARRIORS?!? Not good children. Upgrade them at once and then
    you may resume your little game of war. But speaking of Hitler, he is one littler
    persistent littler bugger. Loosing one city was an inconveneince to him. His Kriegsmarine
    isn‘t big but at least it has galleases (which most civs already have now but
    oh well) and at least he didn‘t do anymuch majorly stupid. He just needs to move
    up quickly! And fast. \nThis is the Renaissance. Failing now is failing this game.
    Take advantage of other‘s sufferings and wars and move in and blitzkrieg fast.
    Beside Lebensraum needs to be fixed up right?"

  narration: A nice kinda beautiful shot of the remains of England in actual England.
    Just 2 little stale cities reap for taking! Also note the brand new Pretty well
    placed Citadel in Wales? That is just one of many more cruel territorial annexations
    that will continue until somebody falls. A sad but true reality Elizabeth. I think
    you should just call in Winston Churchill in from the future and help embolden
    the British cause. No wait... Just English now of course.

  narration: The Trung Sisters have entered the Renaissance! And with that a new era
    of feeding back Mao cities and reminding Tibet who the real empire is, begins!
    Vietnam is also the intersection of 3 different religion; Shinto, Buddhism, Akkatt-U
    and the I-don‘t-know people. So don‘t be surprised if Japan, Burma (not right
    now) and Tibet start warring with eachother with great prophets and missionaries
    all happening in Vietnam.

  narration: Well,Paul Kruger just reminded himself that he had a declare war button
    on the leader screen and was curious and pressed it. This one has only supply
    line for Kruger and this could break him if Saladin is smart. One a single tile
    connects the core of the Boer empire to Klerksdorp which will be really really
    annoying for Paul Kruger. It can be widened by one if the Kongo offer open borders
    but until then the Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyubids just need to be smart. Saladin has a big
    army at Dire Dawa so if there is actual fighting it will be interesting.

    but forgot he had two really annoying cities bordering Saladin. Good job Mali!
    Saladin of course graciously accepts this double free city offer. Meanwhile Kongo
    forces advance onto Denkyira with defiant Ashanti rallying behind the city and
    Mali does stuff, as in not pushing the front line much further at all for reasons.
    Stalin has also entered the Renaissance too.

    is under fire on the ground. Which is troubling. The Trung Sisters have gotten
    so tired of Rizal and his wars that they join in on the gangbang moving their
    navy on to the border ready for war. This is an absolute disaster for the Phillipines.

    Mansa Musa is rage quitting at his stupidity and his officers are all disapointed,

    Balista are nowhere to be seen at all whoch is worrying. The Last Legion should

    And even more importantly, the map!! Catholicsm is snowballing through Canada and Inuit and is on the verge EDGE of spreading and having all of South America to itself! So that will be awesome. Eastern Orthodoxy has all of Africa to itself. And the Australian continent begins converting to Buddhism!! Indonesia first, then Kimberley, Australia and of course little turtle Maori.
    OK! That‘s it! Phew. I have been constantly writing, editing, revising, rewriting and thinking for the past 4 hours straight and am barely 10 minutes now to the deadline of it getting uploaded! As a result this might be delayed so I deeply apologise but I am pretty proud of the 6,000 words I was able to write in such hurriedness and panic. (I just got notified to write this at about 1:30 AM AEST technically this morning right now haha. Please feel free for constructive criticism and such. I worked hard ensuring this wouldn‘t be a massive disaster and ugly to read. I had to rush it in the end thus the less amount of writing near the end but still good quality. Again thank you! I am /u/Professor-Reddit signing off! Thanks!!
