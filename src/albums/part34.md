    Oslo already blockaded. The main Swedish troops are pouring in from the North

    only having a badly wounded privateer near by, I don‘t see this city flipping

  narration: Leningrad, a city that in real life survived a siege of 872 days, falls
    to a Siberian Lancer. The combat bonus that Lancers have against cities rely just

  narration: Blitzkrieged by stronk Soviet troops, both Leningrad and Morelia are

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part34-scene27.jpg
  narration: Iceland better watch out, Maori must be looking to expand its power in
    the Atlantic. Plus this look at Oceania shows that if Australia wanted to, New

  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part34-scene28.jpg

  narration: Hawaii decided to adopt the Autocracy Ideology, while an Inuit submarine
    looks on. No big surprise here due to the massive ideology pressure that Australia

  narration: Braga is at nearly half health, and the Portuguese are still pushing
    towards. Was giving Braga to Morocco Portugal‘s plan all along? Perhaps for the

    aren‘t looking good for Lincoln. New York isn‘t likely to fall back into American

    are dying in the funnel deathtrap."

  narration: The frozen Inuit holdings in Northern Canada are standing strong. With
    Infantry, Planes, and Battleships, without a doubt, the Inuit are ready to win
    it. The most technologically advanced civ in North America won‘t go down without
    a fight.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part34-scene41.jpg
  narration: Kimberly and Maori make peace, and the Coral sea is no longer running
    red with blood. Kimberly might have had a superior amount of units, but Pukekura

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part34-scene42.jpg
  narration: The Blackfoot have made peace with Canada, getting the sweet 1 population
    city of Itazipcho out of it. I find it odd that Canada would make peace due to
    their tech advantage, but perhaps they did not wish to fight a two front war.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part34-scene43.jpg

  narration: Alongside with a nice shot of the Icelandic Core, we can see that the
    Inuit has declared war on the the mighty Icelandic empire. Although. the Inuit
    have far more technologically advanced units, navigating their way around Icy
    chokepoints may seems somewhat difficult. No matter! The prospect of a war over
    Greenland makes me warm at night, and not just because I wet the bed on occasion.

  narration: Out of nowhere, Simhapura has been taken back by the Champa. With only
