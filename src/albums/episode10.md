  narration: "<p>The city of Sunud might fall with the entire battalion of composite bowmen around it and the warrior in wait. This does not concern the Khan though, as it seems that he brought just another settler in case he lost the city. I wonder if the citizens of Sunud feel abandoned.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Seljuqs are right screwed. They have no forces to defend Rey from Palmyra and all their actual forces are bogged down fighting in the west with India.

Although Manx is a formidable naval power, the Moors are nothing to be trifled with and have only a few cities at risk of counterattack, while Manx is fully exposed to attack. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere in Britain, St. Andrews has been stormed by a longboat crew and they have set fire to the city, pillaging everything in sight.

  narration: "<p>I find it funny that when Scotland built the Great Wall, they were immediately dismantled by all their neighbors. Maybe the Great Wall was just a bulletin board that insulted all of Scotland’s neighbors.
