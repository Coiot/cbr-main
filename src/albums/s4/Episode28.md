    narration: "<p>We open on a bleak shot of the remaining Mamluk territory.  Idris Alawma has ordered the Kanem-Bornu generals to construct fortifications outside the walls of the city to support the siege. This aggressive citadelling has forced most of the remaining defenders into the Red Sea where their bloody corpses threaten to stain the water the colour of it’s name.</p><p>To make matters worse Idris makes peace with Pontus, meaning a capture of Damietta would be much more likely to stick. Furthermore the Dzungars make peace with the Selkups in order to join a coalition against Shajar Al-Durr, along with the Visigoths, and Alouites.  Pontus, at a loss for anything better to do, declares war on the Osage.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>The big news here is that the “Movement to end Mamluk” grows, adding the armies of the Asfharids, Bukhara,  Makhnovia, the Selkups, and most worryingly for Shajar Al-Durr, Pontus, to their number.Saba-D'mt also DoW the Kalmyks, but with no direct line of attack this is unlikely to come to much.The S.E.A. and Oceanic nations are also interested in the potential of Africa and send exploratory expeditions to test the waters. Noongar are best represented and have dealt damage to the Mogadishawi city of Aw Dhigle, but their ships are scattered far and wide in this slide, and seem to lack an overall command.Zhenh also make a half-hearted attempt to capture the city, mainly for laughs. Their sailors take pot shots at the settlement crying out “Aw!” for misses, and “Dhigle!” for hits.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Koxinga doesn't seem to have moved past his strategy of only sending frigates to attack islands. The one melee vessel within striking range is currently surrounded by a hostile Palwa flotilla, and as such unless the Zheng troops to the north-west are able to skirt the Palwa ships and engage, it looks like the city will stay with Abu Bakar ibn Umar, for now. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Unlike its Northern counterpart South America already has plenty of juicy wars in progress. Notably the continued Bora-Bora conquest of the continent, supported this time by Ecuador, both of whom are making progress against Tiwanaku. Bora-Bora have set up rough siege positions outside the cities of Algrete in the south-east, Atacama in the south-west, and Pokotia, betwixt the two. They have not dealt any significant damage yet but the defenders are few, so it may only be a matter of time.In the north Ecuador slams walls of outdated melee units into the walls of Pariti and Pucará. The approach is difficult, slowing reinforcements so it remains to be seen how effective this will be in the long run.Of small note: Vijayanagara join the “Movement to end Mamluk”.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>An Islamic contingent, consisting of eSwatini, Saba-D'mt, the Mogadishu, and the Mamluks join “Operation Osage”.This prompts Ndongo to declare war on Mamluks, presumably as their coalition invite got lost in the post. Finishing off the sidebar round up, Mongolia makes peace with the Mamluks and Kalmyk makes peace with Sierra Leone.Unrelated to all of this is the main focus of this shot, the Vijayanagaram great musician Elis Regina. Born in our Brazil she blended various common styles of Brazilian music into a pop synthesis. She also spoke out against military rule in the country whilst touring in Europe.

He decides to make peace with the Alaouites, leaving them in control of their capital Mekenes, and nothing else.Ismail ibn Sharif rubs his hands together, as he thinks about the Kasbars he will build in his remaining desert. The meta is about to change. s/In all seriousness this is a bad sign for Sierra Leone. They have been at war for many parts, and sent countless units to an early grave, for the most meager of rewards. This peace will save them an elimination penalty, and allow them time to rebuild an army before there are reprisals but make no mistake, the world has seen their weakness and has taken note.</p>"

In short, Ensor is a dangerous person who has great changes. ... He is consequently marked for blows. It is at him that all the harquebuses are aimed. It is on his head that are dumped the most aromatic containers of the so-called serious critics. “He is reading a review by a critic called Octave Maus, and the words resonate.“Bring him in.” He calls over his shoulder to Alexi. The boy dutifully exits the barn and returns a few minutes later with the artist.“Greetings comrade Ensor. I have heard much of your prowess, I wish to offer you a commission.” Makhno gestures to the seat opposite him, at the candlelit table. James sits, and takes the offered drink, toasting Makhno.“This is a great honour Bat’ko Makhno. What do you require of me?” Inquires the artist.“Your first task will be to create a portrait of the nefarious and malodorous monk known as Grigory Rasputin. He has absconded with the bulk of my forces, leading them on some theocratic quest to what he calls Russia.

The idea is that they will be used to convey messages between friends and family distributed by the newly formed English postal service.Best Selling ‘postcards’ include: a portrait of a Burgundian woman encaptioned “Wish you were her”; a picture of a family on a beach reading “Greetings from Autun”; and a Bristolian cityscape titled “At least it’s not Lincoln”On the continent several English generals approach the border of Burgundy and the Bavarian empire.

Granted, only Kazan can actually reach them, unless they allow their allies open borders, but Kazan are more than powerful enough to do significant damage to Bukhara without much back up. The Bukharan exclave, not pictured, shares a significant border, and lacks any means of resupply. This could be an easy win for Möxämmädämin.Palwa decide to get involved in the “Movement to end Mamluk” probably because there is no conceivable way that this war could backfire on them and that would make a nice change. Pontus declares war on the Ume-sámi, and upon seeing the great army mobilise once more the Makhnovist troops immediately take up arms and head to Ekaterinoslav. When they reach the outskirts of the city they are surprised that the Pontic army does not immediately open fire on them, instead one of the soldiers shouts across:“Have you come to help with the war effort against the Ume-sámi?” Embarrassed the Makhnovian troops shuffle their feet and mumble amongst themselves until one calls back:“Yeah, that’s right, war with the sámi”.Pontus and Makhno reunited, and it feels so good.Singapore makes peace with Mexico, to try to create a little balance.</p><p></p>"

The next Power Rankings dropped them down, and they have not yet made it back to the pinnacle since. Last episode they adopted Order, a wise move in that it temporarily sorted out their happiness issues. Unfortunately for Trøndur í Gøtu Iceland is once again full of barbarians. For any British readers an Iceland full of barbarians this close to Christmas can only mean one thing, the three bird roasts have finally hit the freezers. On the cylinder it would seem to be a sign that Trøndur has already pissed away all the good will this ideology brought to his citizens.Whilst the Faroes remain a superpower I wouldn’t like to be on the receiving end of a coalition war declaration from the autocratic powers, especially if my troops weren’t fighting at full strength.  To try and combat this wave of dissent Trøndur recruits Louis Lumière. This early cinematographer created what were probably the first moving films. His current assignment is to go to Greenland and make movies of the tranquil, and simple lives of the people there in order to quash the rumors of misrule circulating the empire.</p><p></p>"

The only remaining defender is a heavily outnumbered and outgunned composite bowman who couldn’t recapture the city for a turn if he wanted to. This is a mixed blessing for Pontus. It opens the door to meaningful wars with the underperforming Saba-D'mt, or the underdeveloped Kanem Bornu, and it gives new angles of attack against Rome and the Qarmatians. The other side of the coin is that they will have incurred a heavy warmongering penalty, twice, souring relations with any nation that was not part of the “Movement to End Mamluk.” Latvia opening the Black Corridor in the previous slide also gives them a powerful new neighbour to worry about.As Shajur Al-Durr makes his way to the great Sub in the South he reflects that he could have had a worse run of it. Sure he messed up royally by refusing to settle for far too long, then going on a spree that drew the ire of more powerful neighbours. Despite this his civilisation held on longer than some who were esteemed far above him, first through a stronger than expected defense in a coalition war, which eventually reduced him to a rump, and then in quiet irrelevance in a mountain stronghold until the day an enemy discovered weapons so powerful they could not be withstood. Still, he saw many great things in his time, and in the end his defeat was fairly swift and hardly cruel.</p>"

There is horse spit from when he collapsed on his mount's neck, but didn’t let go, and globs of saliva flew from the furious creature's mouth. There is blood, some is his own, some is not. In his left eye there is a persistent sting of shrapnel. He ignores all of this and concentrates on holding onto his horse. The beast knows better than he does now. The gates are getting closer. He pulls himself up, roars away the pain in his shoulder and hefts his gun. He aims briefly, and prays long. He hears the strangled scream of the last defender as the ball punctures his throat. The horse gallops on, and he is inside the city, he has conquered Big Bend.</p><p></p>"

Qarm has the numbers, but Vijay has the tech. Neither has the strength to go through the Afsharids, so this is an important last chance to break out of a weak starting location for both leaders. We’ve seen Vijanyangra over perform in these sorts of situations before, could this be an ill omen for the Qarmatian court?</p>"

That’s in the top left, a bit of foreshadowing, a cliffhanger if you will. Waghi destroyers, cruisers, riflemen, and artillery all peak out of a dense purple mass in the corner. Who will the Wahgi come for?
