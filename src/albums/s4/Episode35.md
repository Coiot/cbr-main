    narration: "<p>Our PR slide for the week focuses on my sweet boys, Mexico. So strange to see a civilization win a war resoundingly in a previous episode, increase their land far past a pinch point for an encroaching military, and situate themselves firmly on a continent where there is now not a clear leader. However, the more they expand, the more danger they put their empire in. Mexico really needs to focus on rebuilding internally before they lash out at a neighbor, regardless of it is the imposing Yellowknives or the slightly less imposing Seneca.</p>"

    narration: "<p>We begin this episode with a goodbye on Turn 451. The Nivkh’s last stronghold of Okha in the Siberian north has been captured by Goguryeo, to the surprise of no one who caught the tail end of last week’s episode. </p><p></p><p>The Nivkh gave the sub promise at the onset of CBRX Season 4. With a Siberian starting position that allowed for growth as fast as the Nivkh could produce settlers, the potential was there for Nivkh to emerge from Eastern Asia as a player on the world stage. However, their stagnation early on in the face of Goguryeo’s rapid expansion boxed them into northeastern Siberia. Without room to expand, Umu failed to expand by force, instead enjoying their corner of the world. Through the efforts of Goguryeo and, I suppose, the Thule, the Nivkh quickly lost their claims to their Siberian homeland. Umu, now free from your duties as leader of your people - I wish you well. May you find warmer weather across the cylinder. </p><p></p><p>The Nivkh finish in 38th place. F.</p>"

    narration: "<p>One must imagine the Finnish Kingdom happy. I can concede that life is likely difficult for The Finns - they are boxed in by neighbors they will never defeat, the harsh cold of a long Scandinavian winter makes living conditions tough, and they lag behind the world significantly in terms of culture and technology. However, there is a beauty in the Sisyphian cycle through which a Finnish man or woman goes. Without goals of world domination in mind, whether through military might, scientific achievement, or cultural influence, each Finnish citizen, from the lowliest of peasants all the way up to King Kirkukarmu, simply wakes in the morning, does what they need to do to survive, and goes asleep to start anew again. Without a sincere threat of war for over 6,000 years, there is no fear of hostility from their nearby neighbors. Their four cities of Kirkukarmun, Rapolan, Rikala, and Kalliomaki stand not as testaments to the stalwart nature and resolve of the Finnish military, but as humble outposts that have grown organically within the thick spruce forests of the frigid north. Someday, conflict is bound to come to the Finns. But until that point, they are bound to eat and drink merrily, though modestly, with their fellow man.</p>"

Hell, if it were really up to me, we’d have taken them out years ago. Burnt them all to the ground, all of their “achievements”, if you can even call them that, and you and I could call that our new home.” </p><p></p><p>Some think it’s in the Latvian Aizsargi’s nature to harbor chaos and destruction - as a Great War Infantry replacement, it’s special ability is to destroy tile improvements made by Great People. In return, the great Latvian Empire would receive a Great Person of its own. Karlis Ulmanis might look at it as a boon to his empire, but deep down, the Aizsargi just sees it as a way to bring destruction upon the world, no matter how minor.</p>"

Fresh off the heels of their war with Thomas Peters and Sierra Leone, they find themselves outnumbered by a Sabaean military who is destined to encroach on Nkongsamba. The Great King Idris Alawma, who had been visiting Nkongsamba to speak with military generals in the area, is ushered away by his personal security force. In the dark of night, he is snuck past a Sabaean cavalry unit on his journey back to Damanhur. Damanhur should prove safer for now. </p>"

Wahgi has swooped in to take the island village of Tiva, and they have completely enshrouded Pachacamac and ‘avera with helicopters - I count 15 and 18 choppers around each, respectively. At this point, the constant cacophony of Richard Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries” throughout Bora Bora’s island holdings, a la “Apocalypse Now”, are a fact of life. With a few melee units within range of both, and an additional infantry unit outside ‘uturoa, this does not look good for the darling of CBRX Season 4.. </p>"

They just can’t do this to us!” spouts the king, cursing Trondor i Gotu under his breath. After standing motionless for what seemed like minutes, his courier pipes up. “Your Royal Highness, this is not the doing of Trondor, though a devil he might be.” This was Ludwig and the Bavarians.”</p><p></p><p>King Henry turned back to look at the courier. He clears his throat and sits back down behind his desk. “Ah, uhh, very well then. Please fetch my generals. We have much to discuss. As quickly as you can, speak with our Head of Foreign Affairs. I need to speak with the Faroe Islands. They might be our only hope.”</p><p></p><p>War with Bavaria looks troublesome for England, but it is no foregone conclusion. If they can withstand the initial push of the Bavarian troops, then they may be able to hold them off at Autun, as backup troops may have a tough time navigating the Faroese troops outside Dijon.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Turn 453. Babylonian Spy Ishtar shares a file meant to be kept within the innermost circle of the Yellowknife Government. It reads:“A note from The Yellowknife Executive Assistant to The Chancellor. July 19, 2026. Chancellor Akaitcho remains unwell. His personal physician notes that his temporary psychosis continues to persist, though symptoms are beginning to fade. Her reports note that Chancellor Akaitcho hears faint voices and footsteps from around his chambers. He claims to see blurred, shadowy visages of a figure rooting through his belongings during the depths of night. Examinations of his chambers by our investigative bureau before and after these events show that no such action has taken place. His chambers remain as neat and orderly as usual, and all of his personal belongings and briefings are accounted for.</p><p></p><p>In his mandated appointments with our chief psychologist, it has been noted that he is been acting uncharacteristically aggressive and unreasonable. He will fluctuate from prolonged periods of silence to outbursts of fury towards various foreign leaders. He appears to be chiefly concerned with former Hungarian leader Elizabeth Bathory, who passed away over 80 years ago.</p><p></p><p>Our physician and psychologist agree to keep Chancellor Akaitcho on leave until his condition improves.”</p><p></p><p>Ishtar quickly receives a message back: “Ishtar.

Both Tarenorerer and Yagan are unsettled as the superior military force on the cylinder outnumbers their own forces in their shared continent.

Puni and his people are not naive, and they can certainly acknowledge that their almost non-existent navy in the Pacific will never be able to stop the flood of Wahgi troops from taking their islands. Begging for peace from the Wahgi seems to be Bora Bora’s only path out of it. But, over the unending whir of helicopter blades and flyovers from their own air force, the Wahgi hears no such pleas for peace. That, or they choose to ignore them. </p><p></p><p>Six Polynesian islands remain under Bora Boran control. Citizens of Vaitape and Vai’ea have likely accepted their fate, and the 6.5 million Bora Boran strong in Nunu’e see death on the horizon themselves.</p>"

It strikes fear into the world. It’s a reminder that we are Goguryeo, and we are not to be messed with,” says one security guard, as he leans back in his foldable metal chair. </p><p></p><p>The other security guard takes a long drag on a cigarette and flicks it to the ground. “Is it more of a message to show these to the world now? Or to use it when we are provoked? Do you realize how much of my taxes went to building these things? I’ll be damned if I gave Gwanggaeto my hard earned money, and spent my limited life on this cylinder, protecting 4 very fancy pieces of metal that will just stay in the ground. If anyone is dumb enough to invade us, they deserve it.”</p><p></p><p>From his chair, the guard pipes up. “Who’s to say these are only going to be used against military units?”</p><p></p><p>A long silence follows. </p><p></p><p>Four atomic bombs sit within firing range of the Thule.

Shots from English artillery boom in the distance, and both the horses and their mounted combatants shudder as they look up towards the sky. Reinforcements are not on the way, and their time might be up soon. </p><p></p><p>Northwest of Dijon, a Bavarian squad of pikeman give each other motivational speeches as they prepare for battle. Sure, in military terms, they might be “the little guys”, but they vow to fight with spirit, honor, and with all the glory of the Bavarian Empire. The rest of the Bavarian military may wield guns, but the Bavarian pikemen have heart.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Turn 457. Nkongsamba falls to Saba D’mt. The city is likely to flip back to Kanem Bornu, but it should be asked if they even should. For the 470,000 people who call Nkongsamba home, a struggle for power in the city would spell death for a vast number of them. Saba’s intimidating band or artillery have trained in on the city center and are ready to fire at a moment’s notice. To maintain support in his capital-in-exile of Damanhur, Idris Alawma will certainly try to take the city back to keep the morale of his military and his people high. But it will still spell disaster for the civilians of the doomed city of Nkongsamba.</p><p></p><p>Eagle eyed viewers may have noticed a war declaration from Wahgi towards Kanem Bornu in the sidebar. What drives the Great Kind Bol’im to do such a thing? To kick a man and a country down when they are at their lowest point? The Wahgi are far and away the most powerful civilization on the cylinder right now - they should not feel obligated to participate in such petty global politics and declare war on a declining nation like Kanem Bornu. I would posit that Bol’im cares not about appeasing his fellow nations by showing his support in the war against Idris Alawma and the Kanem Bornu people - rather, Bol’im is a man hell bent on bringing death to the weak and incapable and relishing in their demise and defeat. If these accusations are true, then the future does not look bright for our fan favorite Bora Borans.</p>"

I started my day as I did every day - I woke up before the sun, I prepared my rations for the day, and cursed the Great Prince Maximillian I for sending me to the middle of the fucking desert halfway across the fucking cylinder. Just like usual, we finished our military exercises before the morning heat sunk in, and we were dismissed for the day. Through the grace of the gods, clouds began to roll in for the day, and we were spared from the midday sun. Along with some friends, we walked to the border of the land that the Pontus Empire allows us to call home. Across the border, we gazed upon the last bastion of the Kanem Bornu empire. Their artillerymen made their way to the border. We tried talking to them, but we didn’t share a language. Even without speaking, you could see years of exhaustion on their faces. You could see an overwhelming sadness in their eyes. They did not walk upright like a proper soldier should - instead, they walked to and from their weapons slowly and without order. I’m not a betting man, but if I were, I wouldn’t bet on Kanem Bornu. As we walked back to camp, the clouds rolled away. A brief respite from the heat was nice today. I don’t expect one again any time soon. I ended the day as I did every day - I cleaned my bunk, I prepared my rations for the evening, and cursed the Great Prince Maximillian I for sending me to the middle of the fucking desert halfway across the fucking cylinder.”</p>"

Her attendance to private fundraising events by President Nzinga Mbande reveals the contempt that Mbande still holds for the Rozvi people behind closed doors. She speaks of ways to further disadvantage the Rozvi people still living in Danangombe and Khami, which she mentions will “better serve those of us who proudly fly the Ndongo colors.” She is constantly reminded by the republic’s politicians that nationwide unity is their only path forward. Whether or not she will heed those remarks remains to be seen. </p><p></p><p>Though a former contender for the top African contender, Ndongo’s relatively stagnant behavior since her annexation of Eswatini’s African holdings has pushed her towards the middle-tier of the power rankings and InfoAddict statistics. With the rest of Africa in an almost constant conflict, it might be high time for her to find a spot to fit into that conflict.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Turn 458. With tears in his eyes, the Great King Puni takes one last look at Nunu’e, the city he helped to build from the ground up over 6,000 years ago. Nunu’e was the cultural home of the Bora Bora people, a nucleus for Polynesian culture to spread across the islands and into their South America holdings. It was the shining example that all Bora Boran cities wanted to live up to. But with its capitulation to the Wahgi, Puni knows that it will likely be years before he could call Polynesia home, if ever. For now, he will head to the safety and stability of South America. If there was a chance that Bora Bora could hold on to the islands around Nunu’e, then it might have been wiser to move the capital there - but Wahgi’s military forces show no sign of stopping. </p><p></p><p>Four Polynesian islands remain under Bora Boran control. Two are destined to flip next turn. Also, to the Osage caravel situated outside Tupa - these aren’t exactly the safest waters to explore right now.

If Bora Bora can find peace with Wahgi, even at the expense of their non-South American territory, we could still look at them with a hint of optimism. Puni’s masterful work in securing South American lands earlier in the civilization’s history is going to keep him and his proud people alive and kicking. A rebuild of a fierce navy and army are imperative, but a future for the Bora Bora remains. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, war breaks out in Central Asia, as the Selkups declare war on The Afsharids (along with the Osage, who are certain to make a difference).

He is given a disguise to change into, as a caravan is prepared for him outside. As he is smuggled into the caravan and out of the war-torn Damanhur, he utters to a man in his security force, “I told you we should have taken back Nkongsamba.” In the chaotic exodus from the damned former Mamluk city, Idris Alawma escapes to a bastion of relative safety.

Between laughter, he is just able to stammer “Hi Become Death, Destroyer of Worlds, I’m Dad!”He gets a couple of laughs, but in the end, that joke wasn’t really for anyone else - it was for himself.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Mogadishawi recruit great musician Christopher Tin in their Antarctic city of Hamar Jajab. For those of us Babylonians who are fans of his composition “Baba Yetu” from the Civilization 4 game, I cannot recommend his album “The Drop that Contained the Sea”, with a special recommendation for the piece “Dark Clouds”. The Mogadishawi are lucky to have recruited such a fine musician - hopefully he makes it to the mainland to draw inspiration from more than just ice and penguins.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Turn 480. We come to a close on this week’s episode with possibly the last look at Vijayanagara. No eulogy from me this week, but I think we all know how this story ends. </p><p></p><p>That’s all from me this week! Thanks for putting up with the silly and admittedly pointless rambling and lore. Until next time on CBRX Season 4, it’s never too late to swap your allegiance to the great brothers and sisters of Mexico and Singapore. I’ve been Jack, make sure you tell people you stay hydrated and tell your friends you love them. Cheers folks!</p>"
