  narration: "<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another thrilling episode of the Civ Battle Royale X Season 4. In today’s episode 42, titled Everything (a jokish twist of reference to a quote I vaguely remember from years ago), we enter Total War and round out the eighth and likely penultimate narration batch. Meaning we’re not in the final stretch yet, but we probably will be from next episode onwards. Your narrator for today is Boki, newly minted historian, starting a... surprisingly chill internship there. If you’re watching the audio-narration, then it’s the wonderful Doc Ido giving me a voice here. This is gonna be a long episode, 136 slides, and knowing my tendencies from previous narrations, probably long in more than just slide count too, so strap in and strap on and let’s get into it. </p>"

  narration: "<p>For our map this week, as usual, we have Sonicfan’s CBRX map. Not just a wonderful piece of OC, but also a useful resource that I used as a reference throughout the narration, so as to remember which cities were captures, which recaptures, and which hadn’t changed owners. </p><p></p><p>Also a shout-out to Glade’s CBRX 4 Google Maps project, which was invaluable for the last roughly 3rd of the narration. </p><p></p><p>I even made meme as a show of appreciation for them, which you can find on the sub and the discord. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Once again, the OC I chose for this week was the last pre-TW installation of Kit’s Pacific Pals series, this time showing the bad-comedy-turned-painful-tragedy of Noongar. So close to achieving their royale-long ambition... but too little too late. Total War has come. </p><p></p><p>Also, shoutout to Quantum Botany’s North America map, which might’ve actually landed as the OC of the week had they not chosen the wrong name for Wahgi’s Central American possession. It’s either the Province of Betrayal or the Territory of Betrayal, thank you very much. But yeah, that error aside, check it out on the sub or the discord too if you haven’t already. </p>"

  scene_title: "Power Rankings"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season4-pr41-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Leading the PRs going into Total War is Goguryeo. That they managed this despite having an army that, while no small, is smaller than one would expect a superpower to have, is testament to how balanced the civ roster was this season, as noted way back when the season began. Wahgi has a huge army, but is broke financially and scientifically. Faroes are advanced and have hoarded many wonders, but their lands are covered in Wahgi overflow. NH is advanced and has lots of production, but its army is tiny. YK has only a small advanced army and is boxed in by the 4 of the other 5 Big 6er, but has the most nukes of any power. How Singapore is ranked over Wahgi already I have no clue. Between them all, it’s Gogurt that rises ahead, with a complete tech tree, an army of decent size and balanced makeup, and with 2 easy and 2 moderate pickings at their borders, they have more avenues of expansion than most, and only one fellow Big 6er they border at the start of Total War. </p><p></p><p>Author’s note: with the exception of this slide and the OC slide, all of the slides were written before the most recent PRs, so I’ll be referring to the episode 40 PRs’ top 5 as the Big 5, and I’m too lazy to change that up this late into the narration process. </p>"

  narration: "<p>And into the action we go, and... </p><p></p><p>OH FUCK</p><p></p><p>This is certainly one way to start our look at Total War. </p><p></p><p>This is also an inauspicious start to Total War for Bavaria. </p><p></p><p>Someone, either Latvia, Faroes or Sierra Leone, has nuked Munich. </p><p></p><p>Bavaria’s army was already rather small and/or backwards compared to others in the region, so this is especially crushing. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, in Siberia, while the seas of Osage units and Roman refugees have largely been cleared out, Goguryeo and Selkups start hitting into each other. Gogurt’s army is smaller but on average slightly better in tech (with the exception of the nexi, which are, like, top-tier tech), and also holds a significant though not decisive air superiority. Nevertheless, this is enough to earn them to capture the city of Sanchu. </p><p></p><p>Total War’s consequences are easily felt here. Millions bleed and the forest burns. </p>"

Usually, it wouldn’t take this long into a season for that to happen. </p><p></p><p>Zheng seems to have designs on the city, but I think even if they take it, the city will likely be securely Goguryean at the end of this campaign. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Fourth Swahili Coast War from last episode merged into the larger Total War that had just begun, and as a result, Ndongo cities are suffering from the sudden attack of the Wahgi until-recently-peacekeepers. Sadly for the few Wahgi fans and luckily for most of us watching, none of the Wahgi units on screen are melee, so they’re just gonna whittle the cities down until they’re all killed and their success exploited by other powers. </p><p></p><p>Celebrating the schadenfreude of the Wahgi weakening Ndongo while being useless to at taking cities themselves, a few Mogadishawi units take a break to attend a seaside concert of Phil Elverum. </p><p></p><p>History dropdown</p><p>Honestly not much to say about Elverum. A decently popular American musician dabbling in indie rock, folk, experimental and electronic music. He mostly works from his hometown of Anacortes, and his most famous musical projects are The Microphones and Mount Erie. </p><p>End of history dropdown</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over on the Western Steppe, chaos reigns. </p><p></p><p>Osage, Bavarian and Latvian troops are assaulting the Yellownife exclave of Samara. </p><p></p><p>Latvian, Wahgi and Pontic troops are fighting in Ukraine and the Caucasus. </p><p></p><p>Latvian Huliaipole and pretty much every Selkup city on screen are in resistance, which I was usefully told by this season’s gamemasters, Glade, is a result of Pontus’ UA activating against some of their enemies, as Total War means everyone is at war with everyone, and Pontus’ UA activates when at war. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps most hilariously, a Kalmyk knight actually managed to retake the ancient Kalmyk capital of Astrakhan from the Afsharids, and apparently bloodlessly too. This effort will ultimately be snuffed out quickly by Afsharids’ late information and early future era tech, but god dammit, you gotta hand it to Ayuka Khan here. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The... idk... 8th? Noongar-Palawa War has also been subsumed into Total War. Nipaluna and Ballardong have been mostly secured by Noongar from any further Palawan capture, but the incoming assault by other regional forces still makes their Noongar status uncertain. Meanwhile, Osage took Laylatia, and is causing a good bit of chaos for the Palawa coast</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the middle of the Selkup-Goguryeo combat, Osage takes Irtysh from the former right under the latter’s noses. It isn’t gonna last, but I appreciate the effort. </p><p></p><p>Off at the very edge of the screen, Xiatoun has fallen to deep red health, and Goguryeo is slowly breaking down the Wahgi cock-blockers around the city in the two top dogs’ race to re-eliminate Shang. </p><p></p><p>Daji, for her part, feels conflicted. On the one hand, she would be losing her homeland for a second time, but on the other hand, after so many years of her second reign, she finally gets to reunite with her girlfriend Elizabeth Bathory on the sub. They’ve kept in touch through Babylonian tech that the queen had been hiding from her industrial era subjects, but nothing can replace physical proximity. And she missed that. </p>"

  scene_title: "Uhh..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode42-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Both of the top dogs of Africa, neither of which is a top dog of the cylinder, are using the minimum viable land force strategy. Currently, it would appear Sierra Leone is the better one at using it, seeing as they’ve captured Plingo Andongo from their main rival. However, Sierra Leone got one big disadvantage that Ndongo lacks, and that is Pontus’ UA striking them. Matamba is at half-health, possibly due to a nuke strike. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode42-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Already we’re seeing people trying to make peace and being forced by the Babylonians’ Total War Protocol to go back to war. Tsk tsk. One of you has to win and we’re not waiting another 800 turns for you to get your shit together. Probably. </p><p></p><p>Anyway, as mentioned previously, the Kalmyk restoration didn’t last, as Afsharids took Astrakhan again. F. Even more, they’ve joined the race for Samara. Currently, and as expected, it is the Wahgi that are proving Afsharids’ biggest problem, but that problem currently appears manageable. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Further north, the Latvians move in an offensive towards Jelgava, trying to avenge their defeat in the Latvian-Selkup War now that the Selkups are at a numerical disadvantage and tech parity. </p><p></p><p>However, we are also informed of much sadder news - Alexandrovsk, the site of Makhnovia’s legendary last stand, has been wiped off the map, likely through usage of nuclear weapons. </p><p></p><p>Can we get an F in the chat for this legendary city.

  narration: "<p>Over in and around the Gulf of Aden and... not only is the Qarmback from last episode still ongoing, but it’s even doubled. Yes, indeed, Hajar has been captured by the Qarmatians, and Mogadishu, while near to doing so, is yet to actually capture Safyan. Bravo. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Pontus has captured Azeba. In all honesty, it feels ultra-weird to see Azeba and Tamna be under different civs in this specific way. Like... You see it too, right?............... Right?</p>"

Cities that were Wahgi’s at the start of Total War, not just the newly captured ones, are in resistance too? Is Pontus’ UA hitting them too? Holy shit, I already was somewhat of a Pontus fan, but this just improved their PR for me immensely! </p>"

  narration: "<p>Wahgi and New Hollander troops are engaged in the vicious fight for the fate of South America. And I think this confirms it. Wahgi is being hit by the Pontic UA. This will, in an ironic twist, give New Holland a production advantage over the Wahgi, meaning, the longer Total War drags on, the worse the Wahgi chances to win South America. </p>"

Both Wahgi and Pontus can still contest it though. </p><p></p><p>More Latvian cities, including Kassa, are being hit by the Pontic UA, as are the Bavarian Gaziura and Csejte. </p><p></p><p>Rome is still somehow holding on for dear life. </p><p></p><p>Latvia is trying to join in the struggle for Gaziura and also trying to cross the mountains into Csejte. </p><p></p><p>I hope the remaining Kalmykian knights can emulate their martyred comrade from further east and do something funny here.

The Afsharid governor thought he could catch me lacking. The last thing he saw was the price tag on these boots. We smoking it like it was 2024. You make fun of my knights, and I’ll kill you!

  narration: "<p>As part of their “annoy Boki as much as possible” campaign, Wahgi has captured Baune from Bavaria, though Faroes will likely try to reverse that. I believe those are Mobile SAMs, which I believe have a weak melee attack, so a capture may well be imminent. Which is just as well, seeing as the Wahgi seem to be even more of an annoyance to Faroes than they are to me. Go get ‘em Tróndur!</p><p></p><p>Further east, Latvia is knocking on the doors of Nuremberg, and the city is a little under halfway to accepting to open it. </p><p></p><p>Also damn, I knew Total War forced every civ to act, but I didn’t expect Ume-Sami to actually leave their own territorial waters to do something in Latvian ones against the Faroerg. </p>"

We also can see a wider view of Latvia’s border regions, and combined with previous slides, this leads us to the conclusion that Latvia’s actually Latvian cities are productive, while all those founded by other civs are in revolt, probably a result of Pontus’ UA only partially affecting Latvia. </p>"

There, she was welcomed back to the crew by a party of fans and other old CBR leaders she struck up friendships with, but at the head of the group was her girlfriend, Elizabeth Bathory. The two embraced for the first time in over a century and a half. It has been entirely too long. Daji didn’t expect her wine collection to already be tapped into so quick after making her way back into the Antarctic ice, but she, Lizzy and those of their friends and fans that drank enjoyed themselves to several bottles between the all of them. Sodas, juices, water and all manner of snack, sweet, fruit or cookie was had too. From the celebration, those crew-members who didn’t partake in the party joked “One would’ve thought she had won the Royale from their celebration lol”. Drunk kisses were had too. The reunion party didn’t have a definitive end, just kindof slowly fading out over the hours of the nightless Antarctic day, until the last partygoer went to sleep. When a member of the crew woke up the next day, he went to check in on the room, stealing a handful of sour cream and onion chips for himself. Before he left, though, he chanced a glance at the Bloody Countess and the Fox Queen, seeing them slightly messy, sleeping in a loose hug. He left the room, before sending a message to another crew member, hoping she sees the message when she woke up. The message contained just a single word: “Peak”. </p><p>End of lore dropdown</p>"

Off at the edge of the screen, the Selkups have captured Uliastai, eliminating Osage. </p><p></p><p>The Osage were, I’d say, a decent civ in this royale. They settled throughout the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley and took a city or two or whatever from the Shawnee, before fighting a Seneca-Florida alliance to a stalemate. After that, they spent most of the game just sitting there. They eventually finished the job with the Shawnee, survived a coalition war where they were threatened by the Pueblo, and occasionally skirmished with their neighbours. I forgot if they participated in the downfall of the Crow, and if they did if they managed to nab a city or not. They would fight alongside Pueblo when the Yellowknives invaded, and if they had any gains from the Crow downfall, they lost those to YK, but that was still better than how Pueblo ended up. They then got citadeled to oblivion by Mexico, who was trying to make a corridor to invade Seneca through. Then the Osage redemption era began. They would end up capturing the cut-off Thule colony of Pituffik, before using the situation of a weakened Seneca and Taíno to gain an eastern coast board. In the last couple of episodes they got their notoriety through use of overflow units, becoming one of the participants in the Samara Wars and participating in the downfall of the Taíno, the Dzungars and fellow overflow nation the Ikko-Ikki. Then they got absolutely dunked on by their bigger ally YK who betrayed them for the land, taking almost all their cities in the peace treaty, leaving them with just the Bahamian metropolis of Yuma to their name. Yet be eliminated by a New Hollander capture of Yuma they wouldn’t be. Instead, they raged across Central Asia and Australia, capturing Irtysh, Laylatiya and Uliastai from the regional powers, until they were pushed out of each one, one-by-one. Finally, only Uliastai remained, and the Selkups soon snuffed out the Osage last stand there. From a boring presence to a banger performance in the last few episodes, the Osage knew how to gain the love of the community, myself included, in the last moment. Kudos, you glorious MFers. F. </p>"

With no remaining Roman units anywhere to be seen, Rome is eliminated, and Trajan finds his way to the sub. F. </p><p></p><p>Rome was one of the best Italian entries we’ve ever had in a Civ Battle Royale, potentially the best - which is just as well for the Optimus Princeps Traianus. They settled ably across the central and eastern Med, and built a powerful navy, but their war record is more patchy than that of more illustrious powers of the cylinder. Still, they managed a city from Royal Hungary, nabbed some cities from the Mamluks, expanded into much of north Africa at the expense of the Burgundians, Mamluks and others, captured Nancy and, after many failed attempts, finally managed a successful naval invasion of the Visigoths, being the ones to relegate the latter to city-state status, if memory serves. They were able to hold their own against the powerful Saba-D’mt and the poblometrics monster Kanem-Bornu. They even managed to give their best “Finland in the Winter War” impression that one time against Sierra Leone. But then the Faroes and SL attacked simultaneously, and while the Romans managed to weather the storm, they suffered the losses of border regions. Another SL war cost them most of North Africa, and another war with Faroes, while on the battlefield being indecisive (basically as good as a victory), ended disastrously on the peace table, as they had to hand over three cities to the Faroes. SL then came and took 2 of the remaining 3 last episode, leaving Rome as a city-state in Antioch by the time Total War started. And yet, Trajan and his people refused to give up, and although it was by dumb luck more than anything else that they managed to do so, the Romans survived for well over half of Total War’s first episode. But, the conquest, be it by Pontus, Faroes or SL, was inevitable, and sure enough, the Pontics captured this last Roman hold-out. Except, Trajan personally led a last forlorn hope in north-central Italy, from where they used their enemies’ distraction with each other to descend on their home city and capture it one last time. For the Glory of Rome. Aeterna Victrix. And then, one last time, losing it, and their lives, as SL troops closed in once more. All, safe Trajan, who was teleported into an unfamiliar place. “Welcome aboard, fellow immortal. Welcome... to the Babylonian crew” said captain Xanana Gusmão. </p>"

I swear to god, these city destructions are making me crazy. Do you know how time- and nerve-consuming it is to comb through past scenes and even past episodes I narrated is just to find out the names of destroyed cities. And what’s worse, no one is forcing me to do this, except my own compulsion to be thorough and give you, the readers, the most accurate details possible, or at the least the most accurate details I can bother writing down. You better be thankful. OK, rant over, back to the episode. </p><p></p><p>EDIT: Hi, Boki from the future here, I’m sorry to interrupt me here. Yeah, uhhhhh, like half a dozen or a dozen slides later, I forgot exactly, I started using Glade’s map because it was easier and faster. So, uh, yeah. Back to you, Boki from the past. </p>"

Born in 1685 and receiving an education in Halle, starting his work in Hamburg and Italy, he moved to London in 1712, and became a naturalized British subject by 1727. He was influenced both by German choral polyphony and Italian baroque composers, and in turn became a contributor to the peak of the high baroque, brought Italian opera to its highest development, created the English oratorio and organ concerto genres, and created an entire new subgenre within the already existing grouping of English church music. Some of his most famous works include “Messiah”, “Water Music”, “Music for the Royal Fireworks” and “Zadok the Priest”. </p><p>End of history dropdown </p>"

Anyway thank you for reading or listening to this episode, put any feedback in the relevant chat on the Discord or in the comments of the reddit post or the audio-narration on YouTube, subscribe to Doc Ido if you somehow haven’t yet, donate to the Ko-Fi if you can afford it, and... bye.
