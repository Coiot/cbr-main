  narration: "<p>Hello, all. A host of narrators has come together to bring this episode to you, with only a slight delay. Some of us are longtime narrators, while others only recently began following CBR. We’ll all introduce each other as we begin our narration sections But we’re all here to get this next dose of CBR content to you as quickly as possible. We hope you enjoy.</p><p></p><p>With that, we’ll toss you over to the first narrator. This is goatbaby, and I’m here for my third round of narration. I have been watching since X2 but narrating since X3. I was the one who wrote the episode that took Doc Ido an hour and a half to read out. (Sorry Doc)</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hey everyone, this is Semi, I’ll be stepping in for a few slides here and there to help with the narration. As for this second OC, I’ve opted to highlight the Pacific Pals comic for this week because I love the different fonts. When each different civ is speaking, the fonts change to indicate that. What a nice touch. Also, how kind of Kennyo to donate that city to Umu.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shockingly, Faroes are still the PR #1 by a lot, so I’ve decided to highlight Vijayanagara’s 12-rank rise as the biggest change in the rankers’ opinion this week, tied with Zheng’s parallel rise. The reason for this rise is that they…took a single Harappan city? Huh.</p>"

  scene_title: "History repeats itself"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene06.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Just like my last time narrating, we see a brown colored civ that is not native to the British Isles settle Ireland. Last time it was Greenland, now it’s the Visigoths, who have settled Hispalis on the western coast. Further northeast, we can see that a few Faroese triremes as well as one Visigothic trireme has taken damage. Have the two declared a war we don’t know about? If so, Hispalis might be in trouble very soon.</p>"

  scene_title: "Freezing Fronts"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene07.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Even further east in Scandinavia, we see that the Faroe-Sami war has concluded with Maja ceding Jokkmove in the peace deal. The Faroese have more civilian units than military, and only have three land units to defend their new acquisitions, so this peace deal came at a good time for them. The Sami meanwhile are looking increasingly locked out of the North Sea.</p><p></p><p>In the north sea, a Shang scouting party takes notes on what they witnessed on the coasts during the war. This party is eager to head back home and share what they have learned with Lady Daji. Witnessing Faroese tactics and Sami responses to them seem to be just what the Shang need to learn to counteract the amphibious attacks by the treacherous Goguryeo and the barbaric Ikko-Ikki.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As things cool down in the north sea, things continue to heat up in the Caucasus and Russia, as Kazan once again rips into the Kalmyks, capturing Astrakhan and Samara in one fell swoop! Kazan Tatar riders triumphantly chase after retreating Kalmyk horsemen, laughing as they cut them down. Yurts and farmhouses burn, and it seems the whole steppe is ablaze.</p>"

  scene_title: "Too Little too Late"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene09.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Peace has finally fallen in the Arabian Peninsula, with Pontus coming out very bloody, but it could have been worse. They lost Eupatoria and Diosacrus but kept Bandar-e-Bushehr. The peace has also saved Trapezus from the fury of the Sabeans. They also have finally advanced further down the tech tree, as they now have a few swordsmen and composite bowmen in the north, but it obviously was too little too late.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hey folks this is Lasqueto taking over for the rest of the narration. You probably know me as the PR team’s laziest ranker, but without further ado, let’s get back to the action.</p><p></p><p>Peace reigns in the Balkans, as Mithridates reluctantly lets Bathory keep Gaziura, to her obvious glee. This declaration comes at a good time for the Hungarians as it frees up the army to fight back against Latvia in the north. The people demand vengeance against Ulmanis for the blood spilt in Komarom, and the full might of the Hungarian Military marches forth to reclaim it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Down in the Sahel, bowmen defend the frontier town of Bornu, but their numbers are starting to look thin. King Idris is struggling to find recruits willing to fight off the purple invaders. Saba meanwhile has no such trouble, and their horsemen are already riding westward. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the north, Rome marches on Cairo.</p>"

  scene_title: "Empty Heartland"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene12.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Despite how it might appear, there actually isn’t any room for  more cities on Madagascar. Prospective settlers from the far lands of Vijayanagara and Qarmatia instead have to settle for the outlying islands. Mogadishu holds the greatest swath of the island, and judging by the trireme fleet forming around Merca, Umar has his sights set on taking Mhlume and uniting the island under his rule.</p>"

  scene_title: "Yes We Astrakhan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The battle of Astrakhan rages on as Ayuka Khan rallies his troops to flip the city back to his control. Meanwhile in the north, Samara also falls back into Kalmyk hands. This puts Kazan on the back foot, given they have nothing but bowmen on the front lines. Swordsman reinforcements are on the way though, and these cities will likely not remain Kalmyk much longer.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>There seems to be a bit of a traffic jam happening in the South China Sea. A Singaporean landing party sent to take Bac Giang gets caught up against Siamese reinforcements heading for the Philippines. As naval officers from each side hurl curses at eachother, Dai Viet’s cities remain undamaged.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Faroese settlements on Greenland continue to expand and flourish, carving out a surprisingly good living in the inhospitable north. They act as refueling posts for travellers making the voyage to the new world colonies, and send back valuable ore to the homeland. As we speak, a new party of settlers strikes out into the copper-rich interior.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pampas Palava"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Rio Grande is increasingly looking like Rio Pequeno. The mighty Tiwanaku empire has Alegrete under siege, while New Hollander pikeman roam the countryside around the capital. Even the lost Bora Borans of Patio and Fa’Anui, so far from their home isles, are causing trouble near Cacapava do Sul. Fearing for their lives, the Riograndense nobility flees to their frigid outposts in the south Atlantic, to no small resentment from the general populace. </p>"

  scene_title: "Ayo The Pizza Here"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Watching the chaos unfold in the South, Koxinga sees a golden opportunity to capitalize on it, and declares war on Maguindanao. He clearly has his sights set on Ubon Ratchathani, aiming to sneak past the Thai fleet currently blockading the city and take it for himself. At the front of his fleet are the Tie Ren - Pikeman who specialize in amphibious assault and taking cities. However, an unexpected storm has scattered the Zheng fleet, and their scattered ships may struggle to be fully effective.</p><p></p><p>Koxinga has always been ambitious. In truth, there is one thing he desires. He’s heard talk from western travelers of something known as a “Pizza Party” reserved only for the mightiest empires, and Koxinga covets one for his own.</p>"

  scene_title: "Siamese Dream"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene18.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile in mainland Southeast Asia, the Dai VIet-Siam war has hit a bit of a lull. Both sides seem to be struggling in the rough terrain that separates the two empires. Despite their hostility, both sides agree that they hate fish even more, and declare war on the Selkups.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "The Cape Of Bad Hope"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene19.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The latest scuffle between Eswatini and Rozvi ends inconclusively, as usual. Labotsibeni doubtlessly wants to focus more on defending against Ndongo. Nhlagano is cut off from reinforcement, though, and Ndongo’s troops are already circling the city and preparing for a siege.</p><p></p><p>Rozvi are also not looking great despite not being actively invaded.  Settlers wish to flee the overcrowded cities of Danangombe and Lobamba, but find no land to settle in. The little nation finds itself surrounded by Ndongo on three sides, and it will only be a matter of time until Nzinga decides to finish them off for good.</p>"

  scene_title: "Armada"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene20.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The citizens of Waterloo wake up to find the biggest navy the Mediterranean has ever seen on the horizon. Leogivild is dubbing it “The Armada”, and is deadset on using it to get a foothold in the Maghreb. With how outrageously the local garrison is outnumbered, Waterloo is all but his. With how cut off it is from the rest of Sierra Leone, it seems doubtful this force will get much further though.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With the Sabaeans apparently repelled, the people of Kanem Bornu have found a new outlook on life, and many among the priesthood of Ngazargamu have been finding ways to recontextualize their faith. The Reformation of Mu’tazila is well under way. </p><p></p><p>As for why the Sabaean army is at a standstill, it’s anyone’s guess.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene22.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Sorghagtani makes peace with Pontus, and we get a peek at her empire. Mongolia’s fielding a fairly respectable army - unsurprising given that all their neighbors outclass them significantly.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene23.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ikko Ikki might have finally settled Honshu, but as it turns out it was too little too late. A small Pueblo settlement has been established in the east of the island. This comes as a shock to everyone who expected it to be Goguryeo or Nivkh who would settle first. Kennyo is outraged of course, but he has only himself to blame for this. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The first ships of the Wahgi invasion begin to arrive at the island of Kuno. It was once Wahgi many years ago, and Bol’im has a long memory - he doubtless wants to return it to the fold. Despite being a seafaring nation, Maguindanao’s navy is nowhere to be found…</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As more peace deals are forged around the cylinder, we look at Thule. The Arctic nation, despite being imposing, is relatively unproven in war or otherwise. Then again, their core neighbors are checks notes Yellowknives and Nivkh. Ok, I don’t think they’ll be needing to be proving themselves anytime soon.</p>"

  scene_title: "Lhasa Lmao"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene26.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Khoshuts appear to be continuing the proud Himalayan tradition of having weird snaky empires. They’re also finding out the limitations of chariots in mountainous terrain as they repeatedly fail to take Hai Phong. Maguindanao sends them a war declaration, though this is obviously irrelevant.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene27.jpeg
  narration: "<p>On the subject of irrelevant war declarations, we also have Noongar vs Dai Viet. Noongar are currently experiencing a period of peace after being at war with their neighbours for much of recent history. More cold-fire farms are beginning to pop up around Mendyarrup</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ikko Ikki sails ships to Honshi-Ji in a desperate attempt to retake the city, but it looks to be firmly in Nivkh hands. Ikko is in for another shock when their settlers arrive at Sakhalin to find that Goguryeo has gotten there first. </p>"

  scene_title: "Goliath Syndrome"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene30.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Afsharids seem to have once more underestimated their foe, as they lose Tehran to a small team of Bukharan spearmen. Granted, they look to have the upper hand in the long term, but losing cities to a weaker neighbour again is just embarrassing. </p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Step 5: Prophet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene31.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As the two South American heavyweights descend on Rio Grande, a Tiwanaku prophet crosses the border into New Holland. The two empires have different faiths, and this evangelism could lead to relations souring between the two.</p>"

  scene_title: "China? This early into my CBR?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene32.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Shang declares war on Makhnovia, and so we look at Shang. They look exactly as well as they have been doing these last few episodes, with quite a few developing cities. They seem to have filled out most of the borders of China outside the south, and are well poised into the midgame if they can avoid Goguryeo. As a side note, how are Xinxiang and Yanshi already at 4 and 6 population? Weren’t they destroyed one-citizen shells just last episode? </p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Seriously?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene33.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Well that’s the thing with Armadas - they famously don’t work as well as intended. Peters must be an absolute diplomacy god if he got that peace deal to go through without losing Waterloo. Maybe Leovigild just outsourced declaration signing to an unpaid intern who had to get through a stack of peace deal proposals before 5 and wasn’t paying too much attention. Shit happens y’know.</p>"

  scene_title: "What is this? Peace Deal City?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene35.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Kalmyks somehow convince Kazan to make peace despite being on the verge of collapse - peace must be in the air this episode. Ayuka Khan isn’t out of the woods yet though, since the war with Makhnovia is still raging on. The loss of Samara might actually be a boon here though, as it restricts the front that the Black Army can attack from.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene36.jpeg
  narration: "<p>…Goguryeo’s at war with the Selkups? Which scout accidentally stepped over the border line? Either way, Gogurt seems like they have an easy walk into Ishtan and Varsed if they want the cities, as the Selkups have only a catapult west of the teal barrier some have called “Mongolia.” Say hello to the random Shang snow colony everyone!</p>"

  narration: "<p>The confusion in the South China Sea continues, as more and more Singaporean ships arrive off the coast of Dai Viet.  Meanwhile in the midst of all this, the Siamese reinforcements are still trapped, jostling to be let through. They can only watch as Ubon Ratchathani is surrounded by Zheng ships. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene38.jpeg
  narration: "<p>In the first stroke of bad luck for Maguindanao, Kuno falls back into Wahgi hands. It looks unlikely that Bol’im will take much more - his fleet looks almost as depleted as Kudarat’s. However…</p>"

  scene_title: "So Long, Ubon"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene39.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ubon Ratchathani also falls to the Zheng, to no one’s surprise. Koxinga now controls all of Luzon, giving him an even stronger hold on the South China Sea. A lone swordsman in the hills might just retake the city, but beyond that, it looks to be safely in Zheng hands. The citizens of Kuta Watu look on in fear, wondering if they might be the next to fall.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Off in the Yellowknife capital of Dettah, Akaitcho unveils his latest construction project : Shwedagon Paya. This wonder comes with several bonuses to science, including extra science for religious buildings. While the Yellowknives are an irreligious people, this will still come in handy for them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Hello all and this is PorkBean, picking up until slide 65 as an emergency narrator.</p><p></p><p>Tecumseh receives an irrelevant declaration of war from Mexico, another lucky stroke as all of his key rivals, one way or another, are disconnected from Shawnee territory. The Osage form a buffer blocking Mexico and the Pueblo, and the Crow are struggling to ferry units across Lake Superior.</p><p></p><p>Luck is a poor strategy for long-term survival, however, and if the Osage or Seneca decide to put Tecumseh out of his misery then all he has to mount a resistance with are a handful of horribly outdated archers.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode11-scene50.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Faroese control of northern Canada looks shockingly uncontested, despite their colonial expedition being defended by just five land units, one trireme, and about a thousand unarmed fishermen. None of the Americans are in a particularly good position to take advantage of this apparent weakness with the possible exception of the Seneca, who with a decent enough buildup might be able to rush a few cities before reinforcements arrive. Let’s be real, though, Faroese stats are so scary that I don’t blame Cornplanter for just leaving them be.</p>"

  narration: "<p>German fighter pilot Oswald Boelcke leaps to the defense of Rio Grande, though the only way he’d be able to make any meaningful difference would be if he was allowed to use his plane. The Tiwanaku and New Dutch incursions across the Big River are progressing surprisingly slowly, and Bento appears to have adopted a defense-in-depth strategy with a thin line holding the northern front and the bulk of his remaining units hanging back to defend the capital.</p>"

Huyustus will need to move quickly to clear out the remaining defenders and prevent a flip, but after a turn or two the city should be fairly secure.</p><p></p><p>Johan Maurits is struggling somewhat to position his armies, hampered by hills, jungles, and rivers, but sheer numbers are on the side of the New Dutch and it’s only a matter of time before they make a breakthrough and reach Piratini.</p>"

A war between these two eastern powers would be interesting, as it would cover both land and sea and involve both of these civilization’s unique units. Yoshizaki Gobo is hidden behind a lake and could turn into a grind for Zheng’s units, but Koxinga is more than capable of using his unique Tie Ren as part of an amphibious invasion of the home islands.</p><p></p><p>Albert Göring arrives in Kyushu, working hard as a Great Merchant to reclaim his family reputation despite his more famous brother.</p>"
