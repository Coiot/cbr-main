  narration: "<p>We open on a view of the Cape. Last time, Eswatini was able to retrieve Malkerns, but now Ndongo’s naval invasion attempt has put a serious dent in Nhlagano’s walls. Labotsibeni’s archers might be able to fend of part of the attacking force though, and it will take more than that fleet of bowmen to finish the siege.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Singapore continues on its newly found belligerent “rampage” by taking Walyallup from the Noongar, right under Wahgi’s nose. With this, Noongar’s influence outside Australia is probably done with. Maguindanao is in a bad shape, but if you take a closer look at Lamitan, the Wahgi attack seems to have fizzled out. </p>"

  narration: "<p>As it declares war on Pueblo, we get to see Tehuelche’s core. It’s unimpressive. However if you look on the right side, you’ll see something marginally more exciting : New Holland launches a new assault on the riograndese exiles. It’s a nice fleet for sure - I wonder what happened to the last one they sent one this way. </p>"

Near the occupied city of Genundowa, in a ravaged carry, a single Shawnee spearman weeps for its people. It will now have to do its last stand.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>On the West Coast, Thule declares war on Pueblo. Both of them are toe to toe in Infoaddict scores, as well as in military power. Their fleets seem pretty equal and the Yellowknive’s blocks the way to any massive attack. In the end, this rivalry will be decided by whoever can gobble up that buffer state faster, but Yellowknives is no pushover either. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Recruit Ishtar sends his messages through elaborate codes but the message is clear: the Selkups are considering an attack on the Kazakhs. Vonya’s ultimate decision will depend on the state of Nursultan’s armies, and the least we can say is that the Kazakh core looks barren. Could these horses on the border with Astana be put to good use soon?</p>"

That might help for the long run, but Trondur really needs to shift away from soft power and start using their strength for something. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Ludwig makes big moves as Beaune falls and no burgundian troops seem poised to retake it in the next turns. However I wouldn't expect Bavaria to do much more for now - that army still has to maneuver past the Rhine and Charles could reinforce Dijon from his core. Same for the Italian Alps: the German spearmen could open the path to Nancy but they wouldn’t do much.</p><p></p><p>Still, progress is progress and every small victory should be celebrated.  </p>"

You might think that the Qarmatian fleet around Safwan could threaten Belgaum or Gingee, but I think Mogadishu’s presence will render that difficult.

  narration: "<p>As a bunch of uninteresting wars get declared, we get an interesting look at Bora-Bora’s home islands, with their new city of Tiva. The population of the three main cities is impressive, and the fleet they have amassed is too, but they don’t exactly have a technological edge. If they don’t attack Wahgi, Tehuelche, or Tiwanaku, they might end up stagnating themselves to irrelevancy. </p>"

  narration: "<p>We move to the main battlefields of the Shang-Goguryeo war and, sadly, not much has changed. Yodong is damaged, but will live to see another day, and Yanshi is not yet under any danger. I don’t think that kind of stalemate helps Shang in any way: Goguryeo has weaker neighbors to prey on and easier terrain to fight them. In the end, it’s hard not to see them taking the upper hand. </p>"

What’s more, under the hem of Muhammed Yunus, the bengali Great Merchant, Pueblo is considering making the move to microcredit. Come to think of it, their treasury’s not particularly full.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Their neighbor, the Osage, rests after finishing off that last Shawnee resistance. Their army looks a bit thin to the west, on the border with Pueblo, but they are starting to build a lot of their UU, the O-don guard, a unique Pikeman that begins with experience equal to unused strategics, and gains extra terrain outside friendly territory when upgrading. It’s hard to know right now how much that first bonus might affect them, but the second one will only be useful if Osage finds a new target to attack. And except for Florida, they are running out of weak neighbors. </p>"
