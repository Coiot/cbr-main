  narration: "<p>Hello again to another trip to everyone's favorite showing of baffling ai mistakes, drama, city gifting. (why Jim Medicine... why...). Our name is Lynn(Winn), also known as Train Gang if you've seen us on the discord server, & this episode, we'll be narrating this tragic show that your favorites are probably losing. This time around, it'll be two of our headmates taking different sections of the cylinder, namely, Caitlyn & Paige. If you aren't familiar with systems, I advise you to check resources like Pluralpedia, or ask on the discord server. In short, think of multiple different people with different thoughts & desires within the same body. </p><p></p><p>A bit about us: we’ve been following CBR since middle school, but only joined the discord in 2019, & followed CBRX 1-3 on & off. Now we’re fulfilling our childhood wish of actually narrating one of these episodes. It is our first time narrating CBRX, even if we have a few times in other Civ communities. With that out of the way, I'll let Caitlyn take the next slide.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn: It’s lovely to be in the cylinder again, this time with a fantastic map made by Sonicfan0511. Thank you for everything you’ve done, seriously these maps are a wonderful resource for everyone here. There are still many spots to settle, but the map is quickly filling up. My mind always wanders to how people living in Civ games would interpret everything, how they see the world. It’s part of why we love narrative bits so much, so we’ll try to provide those for you all.</p>"

It’s always lovely to see what our girlfriend comes up with for these every week. Personally, we have a soft spot for Ikko-Ikki, though Zheng is finding itself in a strong position this game.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: Kazakhstan is not in a great position to start this episode, but let’s not forget that they are a very strong contender at the moment. The advance in Aktobe is anything but a rapidly changing front, & if they prove to be resourceful, they may just cinch this part, & survive for another day. But it is Civ V AI, so, who knows what they’ll do?</p><p></p><p>Caitlyn: Perhaps they’ll have some impressive moves & catch us off guard. I don’t know, we’re going in blind.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn (L): Starting out at two of the region’s favorites: the Faroes & the Ume Sámi. The Ume Sámi have done an ambitious & arguably credulous forward settle (Jokkmove) next to the Faroe capital (Tórshavn ★). As much of a Ume Sámi fan we are, there’s not much chance that such a city is not doomed with such a strong navy staring down the new settlement, especially with how lackluster the Ume Sámi navy is. Regardless, imagine a Faroese-Sámi pidgin, that would probably sound so cool. The Faroe unique building, Seyðamaður, replaces the stable, & provides +2 Food for each 'edible' Bonus Resource, and +1 culture from every bonus resource. Upon construction, two sources of Sheep appear nearby. Along with their </p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige (P): Any hopes of a quick Selkups war seems to be in vain, as the siege of Aktobe stalls about as much as it did in the last episode. The AI is again, falling for the classic blunder of failing to commit to one city at a time. Heck there are barely any Selkup units within the city borders as most move south to Astana ★. Meanwhile, it seems that the Kazakhs have to continue their settler spree, while they ramp up defenses across the frontline. </p><p></p><p>L: Aisha, wife of an influential cult, has been active in politics for a while, but seeing as the assault on Atkobe, she sees potential in helping the siege to gain a political advantage in the largely uncooperative Selkup settlements that barely worked together. If she succeeded, she may be able to commend a unified front of the tribes, able to unite them under a government.</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: Noogar finally is manning a reasonable assault upon Minj, & I can expect a loud “wah!” from those in the back in fear of the ongoing siege. I feel most in the audience can see how dire the situation is for our favorite austronesian pals. Faced on two fronts, & fighting tooth & nail in a back & forth over KoЯn.</p><p></p><p>George Dewey, clever as he is, has used the largely disconnected islands as ways to cause disruption for the Maguindanao navy. Using the small islands outside of KoЯn, Dewey has set up long range projectiles to cause additional damage to Maguindanao ships, mislead, & distract them. Some of these have included flammable materials, setting some ships ablaze, hurting their assault on the city. Now her just has to get around to figuring out Noogar’s weaknesses…</p>"

  narration: "<p>P: The Alaouites declare war on Sierra Leone; actually, it seems to be a coalition against them including the Ndongo, & Pontus, for some reason. While it seems like a tricky situation, it definitely doesn’t seem like a killing blow to the young nation, but the Baarle-Nassauesque border may be a challenge for both parties in this conflict. At the same time, Kanem-Bornu has been another victim of a coalition war of both Mogadishu & Saba-D'mt! </p><p></p><p>Also Mexico & Ecuador decide to lay down their arms.</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: While Norwich is certainly flippable, long term it seems unlikely for any meaningful hold from the Burgundians, meanwhile York is looking more unstable by the day. Those trireme next to a city with so many adjacent sea tiles makes it easy to take the city & flip it back & forth.</p><p></p><p>P: I’d not be so sure, this could be a rather unfortunate situation for both parties here. Burgundy is in a really rough spot, not ever having any chance to actually recoup & rebuild. Not that England is faring much better.</p>"

  narration: "<p>P: The Makhnovia front seems largely stable, & without many troops committed on either side for any front advances. The Hungarian front is a bit more active, but not active in any major way. </p><p></p><p>L: Naoe Kanetsugu had some brave ideas, ignoring the war. Lead pointless assaults to coax the Hungarians into open conflict, but never so far as to lose anything significant. In this position, he can be both general & a local politician, able to live both lives concurrently, while using the advantages of both. </p>"

Hopefully they do not make the same mistakes as seen in Aktobe, & can get a quick & successful war. The Ndongo settler seems to be confused where it is supposed to be going, while there are many places left to settle in Africa, Saba-D’mt is not the direction you should be going.</p><p></p><p>P: Also Siam & Dai Viet join the fray, for some reason.</p>"

  narration: "<p>P: The Faroes have built Paro Taktsang! In our world is a Tibetan Buddhist site in Bhutan that has two legends, & is colloquially called the “Tiger’s Nest” due to the nature of the legends. In addition, one legend declares Padmasmabhava was reincarnated as Tenzin Rabgye. It was transformed into a meditative site & modern day is a temple for Tibetan Buddhists.</p><p></p><p>L: While outside the reaches of the city, a local cultist found himself, away from all of the humdrum of the hard life many Faroese people lived, & closed his eyes. As he sat in the cave, he felt something change in him, he began to see visions covering his entire vision. Dragons of orange & black stripes, krakens, & all sorts of creatures flying around him, mocking him. The sounds & words they made were enough to deafen a poor passerby, but he sat. He let nothing enter his mind that they said, & allowed what happened to happen. Slowly, one by one, the creatures fell to the ground, & became walls, floors, & furniture. It was as if a temple had created itself.</p>"

While the city is well defended, if Mdluli is able to fight well, I can see them taking the city back. They do have an advantage with their great general replacement, the Ngwenyama, being Qomizitha at this time. Harappa declares a useless war on Kanem-Bornu, as well. A bit of a spoiler, but this is the only shot of the war we will see in this episode, so you’ll have to see what happens next time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: As the siege of Aktobe ran day after day, week after week, & month after month, the troops on the Selkup side found themselves restless, unable to focus or commit with full effort. During the siege, many civilians from the Kazakhs have fled, & those who escaped the wrath of bored soldiers marched north in hope of finding new hope & safety away from the raging conflict. Despite Aisha’s best efforts, she has stayed away from the frontlines to help tend to political affairs. This war, while still killing, seemed to be slowing to a halt. On the southside, the Kazakhs have bravely fended off any Bukharan advances. </p>"

In the rush to find positions to fill the gaps in Ecuadorian leadership roles, Tiwanaku was picked to be a leading star in the campaign.

While it is a sad show for the Noogar fans, I wouldn’t rest easy if I were a Wahgi fan, as these two front wars have been a drain on resources that could have been spent settling, expanding, & building up armed forces. This brief reprieve may have saved them for now, time is still unclear what the fate of the Wahgi will be. Seriously Noogar, what the heck?</p><p></p><p>L: I’d like to think that Dewey was able to convince the armada to block their own supply lines.</p>"

Both armies & navies are drained significantly, & one or the other will have to throw in at some point. My prediction is that York will remain under English control, but Norwich will end up as part of the Bungundian fold. Also, what are those Burgundian settlers doing?</p>"

One brave settler may be exploring the southern Pacific, but I don’t see where they are likely to settle, barring some barren island in the middle of the sea. It seems that a Tiwanaku settler will be settling nearby modern day Santiago de Chile.

At the same time, however, the Senecan city of Kanawagas looks exceptionally vulnerable. If they are able to resist this attack, their chances of succeeding in this war is greatly heightened.</p><p></p><p>L: As the refugees from Mo-he-ag-gra ran east, looking for any kind of shelter they could find, used their remaining rations, & set up temporary homes in the plains. Coming from conflict, they set upon the outskirts of the forest, so they could easily hide if anything happened. Everything about this makeshift village was built to protect, not to nurture.

The Ecuadorian military seems to be rapidly upgrading to newer, more powerful archers. Mexico’s Caribbean cities seem to have survived without too much damage, which is a relief for them, I’m certain. At this point, the Ecuadorians have no Caribbean or Atlantic ports, & will have to fight for any ports, if they so desire. This may be an advantage for now, but long term, they will need to gain ports for any chance to win the game.</p>"

While troops are rushing to the city’s defense, it may be just too little, too late to save the city from falling into Alouite hands. The spearmen, if they survive this round of attacks, could take the city, but if they perish, taking the city becomes much more difficult for the army. </p><p></p><p>L: A once lively, albeit modest small town, now has had women & children starving in their homes, hiding from the ferocious battles happening so often outside. The fields lay idle with nothing growing. Streets are vacant, minus the occasional raids that all have learned to hide from.

  narration: "<p>P: Harappa has so many settlers, where are they even trying to send them? You can’t just keep pumping out settlers & expect to find home for them in India!</p><p></p><p>L: It’s a good look at Harappa the Rapper’s territory though! You can see the fortress town of Ganeriwala, that later on will probably be a thorn in many a civs’ ass if Harappa falls. Really the entire area of our Tibet is largely going to be hell late game, & no one will enjoy watching that. Wait, what does that text say?</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: My narrative :( </p><p></p><p>P: What are Yuan about Cait? It was bound to happen with the well placed siege Trajan put on. At this point Rome should either peace out, or move on to Cairo, which they seem to be doing nicely. I was not expecting Rome’s breakout to be moving to Africa, but I suppose that could have been expected.</p><p></p><p>L:  ;-; Well all the other fronts are going about as expected.</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: In more shocking news, Yanshi has flipped yet again. I can’t imagine the city is any more than just some charred buildings & red soil from the bodies over the years. Regardless, the siege carries on in Anyang, with what I would say an Ikko-Ikki advantage, but I’d be shocked if it flips this episode, perhaps next episode we’ll see it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: As we predicted, Tétouan has been captured by Sierra Leone, showing the Alaouite incompetence in their multiple spans of wars. The war with the Visigoths; however, looks quiet, but the second the Visigoths decide to roll in their navy, it’s hard to see Waterloo sticking around in Sierra Leone’s hands. The balance of power in Africa has shifted away from those originating in north Africa for sure. </p>"

  narration: "<p>P: Deciding to do something about that war they declared, the Hungarians prepare a siege around the city of Gaziura. There doesn’t seem to be siege equipment, but it should be flippable soon enough, even if it may be poorly arranged at this time. I can see Royal Hungary taking maybe this city, & the canal city of Amastris.</p>"

  narration: "<p>P: Siam has founded the city of Udon Thani, which for some reason had to be pointed out to me. There’s not much to say about that other than it is a shitty one tile island because most land has been taken on the map, which is an important development, meaning civs will have to expand by other methods soon. Also we get to see a trireme skirmish between Qarm & Harappa, for some reason. Singapore is definitely looking a bit scarier now, most civs in this episode of the map are looking tough to crack, & willing to fight.</p>"

  narration: "<p>L: Petra! This may not have been the ideal spot to place Petra, due to the floodplain tiles, but is still a decent wonder to have. I have a deep soft spot for wonder heavy civs, so Palawa takes my heart in Australia. </p><p></p><p>In the reaches of the mine, housing was a must for any steps to collect these resources. During the war, a large number of captives were taken, & eventually would be taken in for forced labor, but this made housing extremely difficult; however, there was a solution. Just on the outskirts of the abandoned mines, there were a series of hollowed out caves that had lost all value to be mined any further. A combination of artisans & construction workers planned & planned to build a series of housing that ballooned into a large city, caved into the mountains. While built initially for slaves, it became a town of its own right, & a part of the Palawa’s pride.</p>"

  narration: "<p>P: The Seneca have declared war on Mexico, in a completely confusing & contradictory move that I’m sure they’ll either forget or regret. Seriously, what was this supposed to accomplish?</p><p></p><p>L: Maybe it was another scout annoyance? Still, the AI loves making foolish moves, so I wouldn’t be so surprised Paige, Seneca is barely functional as is, holding the frontline barely. </p>"

  narration: "<p>L: Seneca’s unique improvement, the Three Sisters Outpost, is a decent defensive fortification that also serves as additional food production on those tiles. When it is built off of Seneca land, it stores foods, then gives it when it becomes Seneca land. Pretty fun unique improvement, I just hope the AI will be able to use it effectively, but the AI tends to suck at strategies.</p><p></p><p>P: Barring the Qarmatians</p><p></p><p>L: QARM SWARM!</p>"

I see Kazan also wanted to see what it’s like to be in a two front war, but they may or may not make any major advancements this turn. </p><p></p><p>L: And with that, that is episode 8! Hopefully you enjoyed Paige & I rambling, & I hope to see you all next week for another installation of CBRX 4.</p>"
