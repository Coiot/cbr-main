  narration: "<p>Last episode, Maguindanao got dogpiled. Usually, these dogpiles don’t involve too many relevant war declarations, but Maguindanao has managed to end up with three relevant wars: Wahgi, Zheng, and Noongar. Siam is here too, technically available to send the occasional trireme over to say “I’m helping!”, but let’s be realistic, nobody’s counting them here. Anyway, the comic’s by Orangechrisy. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Alright, now onto action. In South East Asia, wars that aren’t the Maguindanao dogpile are pretty sluggish. Dai Viet’s wars against Singapore and Siam are mostly a matter of draining the already limited resources of the civ more focused on religion. Last episode, Singapore had managed to bring Bac Giang down to yellow health, but this seems to have been a mere fluke. </p><p></p><p>To the east, we see Zheng currently in control of Ubon Ratchathani.

We’re reaching the point where city strengths are way above triremes’ paygrade, so I don’t think it’s inconceivable that Mag will hold on to most of the empire here. </p>"

  narration: "<p>A 50+ turn long war comes to an end as Kalmyks and Makhnovia make peace. This was another war where the main consequence was draining both civs’ resources. This was especially significant for the Kalmyks, whose capital got flipped, potentially because some Kalmyk units got dedicated towards the Makhnovian meat grinder. </p><p></p><p>But wait, what’s that notification…?</p>"

This alone makes this episode a good one in my books. </p><p></p><p>Mexico makes another good move by achieving peace with Pueblo. Anyone with half a braincell could see that that war was going nowhere after that one-tile island fell to Pueblo. Ideally, Mexico and Pueblo can now start building up to beat up more reasonable targets - such as Taino and Osage, respectively. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Rio Grande hears about this thing called ‘peace’ and decides to try it out. To his credit, it actually works pretty well, because one of the peace deals is with Tiwanaku, one of the main threats to Rio Grande’s sovereignty. Of course, they still have New Holland and Bora-Bora to contend with, so I’d still bet on the Rio Grande core to get overrun, but we’ll have to wait and see on that one. </p>"

  scene_title: "Absolute DOGSHIT diplomat"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode12-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>HUH??? Well, apparently Seneca was the next to hear about ‘peace’ and decided to try it out too. Unfortunately for Seneca, they absolutely suck at it. The successful flip of Kanawagas must’ve shook them to their core, because they give up Genundowa, their most populous city, out of respect mixed with terror. Just when you thought Seneca couldn’t clown out any harder.</p><p></p><p>But that’s not all that is funny about this slide. Shawnee and Mexico are at WAR, and have only been at odds for a handful of turns. Genundowa’s strength is low enough that even Shawnee’s ancient era army has pretty good odds of snagging the city, which would propel them into the two-city gang for the first time in ages. A truly peculiar turn of events. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Ume Sami think back on the humiliating war with the Faroes and come to an obvious conclusion: the Ume Sami religion needs reforming. So that’s exactly what they do. Meanwhile, four settlers (three of which are Ume Sami) head for Southern Norway, where one available city spot still remains. Can the English snag the spot? </p>"

  scene_title: "TO VALHALLA!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode12-scene15.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ume Sami pick the spectacularly thematic RAGNARÖK reformation belief. Seems that the arrival of merciless plundering vikings from across the sea has inflicted some national trauma. Checks out, though. The idyllic charm of Scandinavia was decimated…there can be no peace hereafter. </p><p></p><p>As for the actual impact of the belief, well, if the cutoff here isn’t fooling me too hard, Ume Sami are now getting a +1 production (and +1 culture) on tundra and snow, which their empire mostly consists of. That is certainly a significant boost. Time will tell if it will be enough to break the backs of the Viking colonizers. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Hungarian army raids and plunders the Latvian countryside somewhat haphazardly. Whether Liepaja was in actual danger was already debatable, but now Royal Hungary is also splitting up the army to raid Komarom, too. Even with the Latvian defenders being non-existent, I’m not feeling confident in the Hungarian offensive here. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Noongar reminds Maguindanao (and the audience) that they’re in this war too. Tamontaka has lost about a third of its health, the city is not quite as strong as the core Maguindanao cities, and Mag will struggle to reinforce the city. Altogether, I’d give Noongar good odds here, though the attack force seems a bit haphazard. Good thing Wahgi is here to help. </p>"

  narration: "<p>While Noongar is partaking in the Maguindanao dogpile, Palawa has been working on getting absolutely STACKED. Just look at the disparity across the border here. Gone are the days of Noongar dominance on land. Noongar ought to be scared. </p><p></p><p>Palawa looks dominant at sea too, and…wtf, I know someone called Hannu. Anyway, guess he’s leading the Palawan navy now. I can’t find who this is supposed to be, partially because on googling it just turns up Finnish people of this name. One guess I have is that it might be a mistyped Hanno (the Navigator), a Carthaginian explorer who lived during the 5th century BC, known for his naval expedition along the coast of West Africa.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As expected, the Rio Grande homeland is on its last legs despite the peace deal with Tiwanaku, as the vice grip of New Holland and Bora-Bora keeps on squeezing. They both want a piece of the pie, and at this point there is surely no way Rio Grande can avoid a grim fate. </p>"

Chandragiri has fallen to yellow health from the Harappan siege, and though the Vijayanagara defenders are doing their best, they are assuredly outnumbered. Multiple Harappan horsemen wait in the flanks, ready to rush in when the city is ripe for taking. </p>"

The land-based Yellowknives vs the maritime Thule is a fun contrast, but war between the two would be less fun. </p><p></p><p>Thule has some of their Comp Bow uniques standing around. The Toggling Harpooner can move through ice, and after attacking. It also damages an enemy unit upon moving next to it. Pretty neat thang. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode12-scene26.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Welp, looks like you fellas didn’t pray hard enough. Unexpectedly, New Holland snags BOTH of the remaining Rio Grande core cities, thanks to one sneaky trireme. Piratini is likely flipping back and forth one more time, while Cacapava do Sul is most certainly not flipping. Regardless, Rio Grande is now banished to the Antarctic region, and New Holland has come out on top, getting the most out of the Rio Grande collapse. Gotta feel bad for Bora-Bora, though. They tried so hard!</p>"

It’s all about the fight, even if it changes nothing.</p><p></p><p>For the actual content on the screen, the Afsharid-Bukhara war continues. Elista has taken some damage again, but I don’t see the city falling. Samarkand is healthier, but clearly in more trouble. Shame we do not get to see the Bukharan capital. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Huh, how many settlers with 10% health does Taino have? Anyway, the real star of the slide is of course Ohio. No, sorry, that’s Ohio’. The settling of Ohio’ has blocked the barely-alive Taino settler from settling, which is awfully tragic, if the existence of Ohio’ wasn’t nasty enough on its own. </p><p></p><p>You can also peep the mostly demilitarized Faroe Quebec here. </p>"

  scene_title: "Faith of the elites but you debuff the capital???"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode12-scene34.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Oh, hey, here’s the new Tjukarpa beliefs. Apparently I misread the notification earlier, and they enhanced the religion rather than reforming it. That’s what I get for not actually reading the notification at all. </p><p></p><p>Palawa has added Kivas and From Giving Hands into Tjukarpa. Kivas seems like a solid religious building with food and production, while From Giving Hands seems to debuff the capital while benefiting all other cities. While Tjuparka remains a religion of like two cities at most, this enhancer belief is pretty much just the debuff, but as the religion grows, it’ll be pretty beneficial. All the more reason to make sure they can compete with the Noongar religion.</p>"

To begin with, I don’t fully support splitting up your armies to assault THREE cities at once, but I suppose they do have the manpower for it. It’s usually just pretty bad for the AI.

To see Shawnee at two cities after all this time is nourishment for the soul. It is all I need. </p><p></p><p>Just a bit to the north, big news arrive: Faroes have declared war on Seneca! It’s a bit of a strange decision, considering the aforementioned demilitarized state of Faroe Quebec. But maybe this is the turning point for the region. Faroes certainly have a good bit of production over here. </p><p></p><p>Taino joins the war against Seneca too, presumably infuriated by Ohio’.</p>"

  narration: "<p>…I have no words. But I’ll pull something out anyway. </p><p></p><p>So, after Rio Grande stubbornly flipped Piratini back, seems that Bora-Bora snuck into the city before New Holland could get another chance. In a complete reversal of expectations, New Holland has ended up with Cacapava do Sul, and Bora-Bora has ended up with Piratini. This, of course, makes Bora-Bora the FIRST CIV TO HOLD A FOREIGN CAPITAL.</p><p></p><p>Well, very very likely, anyway. The 1HP Rio Grande horseman may flip the city one more time, but I do feel skeptical. Important to know here is the actual turn order of the civs, where Bora-Bora is the SECOND civ in turn order, after only the observer civ and Bavaria, meaning Bora-Bora should have no trouble clearing out the maimed horseman.</p>"

  narration: "<p>There was some debate about whether there was a Wahgi navy hiding here, just out of view. Well, that solves that debate. There are essentially zero defenders here, should Bora-Bora decide to take advantage of Wahgi’s Maguindanao-related distraction. The technological advantage taking the form of carracks (and hopefully galleasses, soon) would make a naval campaign against Wahgi devastating. I could see at least four cities falling before Wahgi could muster enough of a defense to stalemate against the far stronger carracks. But alas. Bora-Bora seems to care more about South America. Still, a man can dream.</p><p></p><p>Coco Chanel is here. Everyone probably knows Coco Chanel.

We have just a few unhappy civs at the moment, but it’s good to remember that civs fluctuate a lot, and on any given turn, many civs could be moving back and forth from happy to unhappy to happy. Anyway, we have Ikko-Ikki, Thule, and Taino unhappy at the moment. A handful of civs across Afro-Eurasia are in a golden age.

Maybe Rio Grande too. Gold deficits are critical, as they linearly cause science deficits. This means that civs that are already down, stay down. </p>"

Wars against Khoshuts, Kazakhstan, and now Bukhara have achieved little (though Khoshuts did kindly give away a city to make up for it a little). It is hard to imagine that Dzungars would get much out of a war against Shang or Selkups, either. Now, Mongolia, on the other hand…now that could be poggers, if you’ll pardon my french. Dzungars haven’t necessarily been lacking in proactivity, so maybe such a war is on the horizon. </p>"

Sure, they took Honsho-Ji from Ikko-Ikki, but the city was defenseless, it doesn’t count. At this point, I don’t see them making significant gains against any neighbor. After Gogureyo claimed Sakhalin, Nivkh’s capital became almost surrounded by Gogureyo. And all of said Gogureyo land is undefended too, to add insult to injury. </p>"

In the anarchistic chaos of the Maguindanao dogpile, Wahgi influence has been able to stretch all the way across the Moluccas, to what I think is an island representing Timor. IRL, Turgut Reis was an Ottoman corsair, naval commander, governor, and noble who extended the Ottoman Empire's maritime power across North Africa. Turgut has been referred to as “the greatest pirate warrior of all time,” and he was known by the nickname “the Drawn Sword of Islam.” That’s pretty badass. I have to imagine he’s been similarly crucial to the expansion of Wahgi power in the region here. </p><p></p><p>Actually, speaking of Islam, Mogadishu has apparently sent a great prophet all the way to Singapore.

Or they should be, at least - they were at the end of the last episode, and I haven’t seen a peace deal notification. Would fool me though.

War between Sierra Leone and Alaouites is back on the table. The rivalry is reignited, and Sierra Leone is probably looking to take back Kenema, which would be pretty sad for Alouites, who spent so much to take the city in the first place. Going any further than that might not be in the cards for Sierra Leone, considering the mountain passes they’d have to slip through to hit Marrakech or Rabat.

And if this city falls, the other two are likely to fold too - we recall from an earlier slide that the other two cities have half-ish combat strength compared to Pelotas.
