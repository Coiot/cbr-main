  narration: "<p>Paige: Hello, hello hello! It’s Lynn again, with both Paige & Caitlyn around once more for this (very late) narration. You’ve seen us before, & hopefully you’ll see us again writing for you. With that, Cait will give a summary of where the game is. </p><p></p><p>Caitlyn: Where we last left off, Wahgi had pushed Bora-Bora to their South American holdings, while the Yellowknives & New Holland took their shot at México. The war between the Faroes & Rome is in a stalemate, while the front with Sierra Leone is flipping the cities along the Mediterranean like a pancake. Along with that, The Thule took a shot at Ikko-Ikki, while Goguryeo decided to take their shot at them. Oh, & Finland died to Latvia. In the peace deal between México & the Yellowknives, Wahgi took their shot & declared war with their “peacekeepers” taking all of that remained of Mexican Central America.</p>"

  narration: "<p>One of the most dramatic endings to an episode in a while, Wahgi’s betrayal of their ally cemented them in the popular consciousness as a villain. Such a clearly sinister & backhanded assault really set them apart from the rest when they already have been a rising star. It was a good move regardless. Thanks for this Lasqueto!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: No map this time, but outside of this OC, do check out Sonicfan0511’s post & his greatest extents maps! Really interesting to look at. It’s a good contrast on how those following the CBR season view each, & generally there is more support for Goguryeo over Wahgi, but it still fairly exists. It’ll be interesting to see where things go from here.</p>"

If you ever can spare a few dollars, feel free to consider helping keep this project alive that we’ve been reading since we were a child. In addition, this is the last week that you can buy stickers of your favorite Civs this season, so get them while you still can. You have to do so in the next few days!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn: Goguryeo is neck & neck with Wahgi, but the favorite long-term is nothing changes radically for the Wahgi, or they don’t expand much further before total war. Seeing as Goguryeo has caught up & is ahead in tech due to their expensive military, they need to use it, or lose their chances where everyone catches up or that they’re unable to sustain their large military any longer. We still haven’t seen a Civ like Wahgi before, I encourage you to take a look at their stats & the fact that despite how much they’re spending & losing things, that they still are a major superpower.</p><p></p><p>Paige: If we’re going to assign rappers for this season: Goguryeo for Kendrick, Wahgi for Drake, & the Faroes is J Cole. There was some neat discussion lately on others assigned, which I’d agree with TopHat’s comment on Yellowknives being MF DOOM, another one being Lasqueto’s comments on New Holland being Jack Harlow & Mexico being Ja Rule.</p><p></p><p>For Doclodo, I have no idea if you could even put the control verse for the title, but if you can, that would be really funny & you should do that if you can.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 540</p><p>Paige: If you reference the previous episode, you’ll see that two cities flipped back to Bora-Bora since the previous epsiode: Maguinchao & Comlel. New Holland blockinging Pampa Koani is definitely giving Bora-Bora some boost , but their troops are thinning out on the continent significantly. Their navy unfortunately is in the wrong ocean. There really is little chance of Bora-Bora maintaining their current city count, & a peace deal would likely encroach even further into South America. Right now, New Holland’s best chance is to invade Bora-Bora soon. The Wahgi are not invincible either, & there is potential that these lands aren’t guaranteed for Wahgi as their troops are running low too.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn: The city of Otavalo has been between only two nations' hands: México & Ecuador. Taken in a peace deal a while ago, & generally considered as one of the worst moves Ecuador made, now is a metropolitan island in squalor. While soldiers continue to harass the refugees attempting to leave the rubbles of the city that once vibrantly stood without violence, they have not made moves to capture the city, as an assault into the rubble may be untenable. There are some ships nearby that may be able to just take it, but the city is lost long term as the last refuges of the Mexicanos will continue to starve & wait until death comes to take them.</p>"

A once promising power is being destroyed by one of the Big Three, & while troops may take time to fill in, hope is slim. Their only hope is that their sizable navy may be able to flip cities for a while to prolong their demise & try to end the war on better terms. I wouldn’t hold out hope for them. </p>"

The Monterry Madmen will defend their city to the last drop of Mexican blood. The betrayal that México faced will not be unanswered by her citizens, even if hopeless, they will be remembered against the Wahgi menace.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: The Romans continue their well established tradition of flipping cities in this war, costing time that Thomas Peters doesn’t have. This invasion is their chance to create, if not a buffer, at least some more room between North Africa & the Faroes reigning from above. Rome’s troops are unfortunately thinning out, & Traian has to choose how he uses his navy, which bodes poorly for Peter’s chances of making advances in Europe. The front in North Africa looks optimistic, albeit still going to take some time to break through.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn: The revolution’s survivors say that the last battle took place just outside of Chicxulub, while the Wahgi would claim that they took the cities to much fanfare. Regardless, the remaining exile government troops in La Puebla, an ironic name in hindsight, know that their country is lost. </p><p>México had a decent start, expanded early but ended up halted by other North American powers, & moved south. While they slowly made their way along & south, a lucky peace deal or two allowed them a decent position. After conquering Ecuador with New Holland, they reached their peak & a large amount of popularity. Unfortunately this didn’t last very long. Multiple countries took on the emergent nation, & they found themselves unable to maintain their ascendancy. A final betrayal at the hands of the peacekeepers division allowed the Wahgi to have a second footing in South America, leaving them indisputably the top power in the entire sphere. A sudden, yet tragic fall in a nation with potential.</p>"

During this time, some reinforcements come in just in time to help supply the assault deeper into Southern South America. Only a few cities remain between Wahgi & the rest of Bora-Bora’s South American cities. There isn’t much hope, but there is some hope of keeping at least a city. </p>"

Peters is building up & Latvia is still strong, but the powers in between are in terrible positions. Oh, Pontus is okay too. We’ll see how the next few wars go!</p>"

There’s probably not many chances for their long term survival nor winning, but there’s chances for trying to extend it longer.</p>"

Best chance is to try to take on Rome while alright stuck between two powers, even if it’d be a tough fight with Rome’s troops so close. If they continue to wait much longer before making their moves for wherever they want to go. With their broken UA, it should help for the little bit of time that it is useful left.

While the Thule may be able to take Negoro-Ji, further advancements seem difficult at best, especially while fighting for their life. Gogurt’s own Navy, while still moving, is likely to change how things move in this sphere, but they have to maintain some navy for after their war, lest they want to have issues later.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 542</p><p>Caitlyn: Akaitcho met with his advisors for their regular meeting, first tries to address the issues going on: They have limited forces in their lands, one of the Big 3 have a foot hold to their south, & east coast is swiss cheese. The advisors all seemed anxious, worried about what would need to be said & done to survive. None of these problems are impossible to solve, the Wahgi are unlikely to invade the Yellowknives anytime soon, troops aren’t impossible to produce, & they could take Osage & what remains of Seneca easily. That doesn’t mean any of these would be easy. The Faroes to their east is something to fear about, but standing around doing nothing will only ensure failure. The clock is ticking. The advisors offer various ideas: Taíno? That brings them closer to New Holland, Wahgi, & the Faroes. Turtling? It won’t solve the territorial integrity issues. One advisor mentioned the war between the Goguryeo & Thule, & a light switched on in some advisors heads. But, Akaitcho closed the meeting for today, letting them all go home. Who knows what the Yellowknives will do in their position to not only survive, but thrive.</p>"

Slowly but surely their gains against the Nivkh are being lost to Goguryeo, & it’s likely not to be the end. My prediction of how this goes is thus: Thule takes one-to-two northern cities from Ikko-Ikki, Goguryeo takes at least Thule territory in the old world, then & unite their territories on the island from taken Ikko-Ikki cites.</p><p></p><p>Caitlyn: During this time, a dispatch is sent out, to send out a division to Unimak to attempt a distraction. The unit, upon landing, decides to look at their options. The city looks easy to take, but at the same time, it looks like the Goguryeo navy will take it first. From there they decide how to best survive & not be left for dead.</p>"

A submarine shot some missiles, distracting nearby ships from the airstrikes into the city. As the missiles landed in the city, the city was taken by an offload of troops into the city. While this won’t hold, the officers recognized, it embarasses the Thule navy at a time where they cannot lose even more ground, being kicked out of Siberia. While their navy may be able to flip a city for a bit, it is a losing battle. Whatever Gogurt decides on advancing into North America, the Thule will no longer be able to contest any wars going forward without risking everything.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 544</p><p>Caitlyn: Akaitcho joined his close group of advisors, & passed along ideas in the office for how to maintain their internal growth. One of the largest fears discussed was keeping people under control, they seemed confused how to do such. One of the advisor’s kids was drawing off to the side, & he decided to check his daughter’s drawing. It was of a dinosaur. He chuckled, spiking Akaitcho’s amusement & interest. He decided to look over, & see what was drawn. An idea appeared in his head. The meeting ended swiftly, & he quickly met with a few engineers to see what’s possible. A few geneticists were called upon in this meeting, concerned about what would happen if this was put into fruition, but it didn’t matter, only if it was possible. With hesitation, they admitted that it was. That was all Akaitcho needed to hear. </p><p></p><p>Within the month, a massive project was started on Ivujivik, that no one truly knew what was happening, until a convention from one of the top business owners announced a new project: reviving the dinosaurs, & allowing the public to see them. While a vanity project at heart, the efforts were supported by the Wahgi, Palawa, Faroes, New Holland, & Goguryeo for learning more about genetics, with the stipulation that all knowledge will become accessible for every nation supporting the funding. The city government loved the idea, but the citizens were not nearly as much. This didn’t matter, as it would be a trillion dollar moneymaker, their feelings didn’t matter. When the gates opened, the world was never the same.</p><p></p><p>Paige: So as for the wonder’s actual abilities: +6 Happiness, Gold, & Science, along with +2 Great Scientist Points. In addition, the effect is such: “Zoos in the empire produce an additional +2 Science, Gold and Happiness. Provides a free Zoo in the city which it is built. Dinosaur units may appear randomly outside of cities as Barbarians until the discovery of Designer Lifeforms”. It has a score of seven, & is a solid wonder for any Civ, so a pretty good wonder. For anyone who plans on narrating, keep this in mind if you see any barbarian units in this area, this will be why.</p>"

I doubt it will flip more than once at this point, but the Thule look in bad shape if they have to flip their own cities from Ikko-Ikki of all nations nearby. What chances do they have long term? Also Nurgan has flipped back once again, likely not lasting many more flips.</p>"

Despite the fact that the Taíno have a clear advantage in immediately available troops, it’s bad terrain to go through, & the citadels will make advances much harder to get through, & give Osage time to get reinforcements on the frontline. We’ll see how things go. Not sure why Bora-Bora joined in this. This is probably Agüeybaná‘s last chance for prolonged survival, as they are surrounded by, in order of the last PRs, Osage (26), New Holland (5), Yellowknives (4), Faroes Islands (3), & Wahgi (2).</p>"

Their navy makes any naval war easier, but expand to where? Palawa is stuck between a rock & a hard place, & they are waiting to die, despite many things they have going for them.

  narration: "<p>Turn 568</p><p>Caitlyn: The Ikko-Ikki received a communiqué, pushing the two to make a peace deal in exchange for access to the Yellowknives’ market. A few hours later, communication between the Thule & the Yellowknives went dark as Ikko-Ikki was able to open borders with them, allowing a larger front for them to attempt to take the city. But, in a last minute desperate plea, the Thule sues for peace, offering Qaqortoq in exchange for their final city’s survival. The Thule had attempted to make the best of their situation, but when facing Goguryeo, it proved too much, & Ikko-Ikki took advantage of their shattered army & navy early on, & was able to snipe a large amount of their North American holdings. An unfortunate fate, but not undeserved. It must be awkward for Gogut to have this ally, not that they’re not immediately screwed on the first DOW they give.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: Qohaito returns to Saba’s hands, & Aksum is looking rough. While Sabe is bringing in more troops, or rather the front is coming to them, it’s not looking good right now. Peter’s lines are thinning out a bit, & they are being refilled quickly, so if Saba is able to retake these cities & make peace, they may make it out with only losing one city, which is not the worst case scenario. My prediction is Peters takes two-three cities by the end of the war. Also Caitlyn came up with the title, don’t confuse that with me.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: Seeing Seneca’s navy closing in on Kaoto’ makes any chance of the city remaining in Yellowknives hands look grim. The AI, once again, proves that they cannot fight a war without making huge strategic errors like this that will be pounced on immediately. Even with no land route due to Nundawao that’s owned by New Holland, the navy should have no issues taking the city, which is blockaded now due to poor planning. Good job, declaring wars you can’t fight really is taking you places (down in rankings).</p><p></p><p>Caitlyn: I wouldn’t say the Yellowknives are that close. But it is closer than before.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 569</p><p>Paige: Despite the overcommitment of troops & navy to Epuyen, it has been a terrible gambit, as basically their entire advantage has been wiped out. Caçapava do Sul also has been basically bombed so hard that just a ship could take it out at any time. There really isn’t any chance at this point to delay the inevitable, & it will be a miracle if they even have a since city remaining in this episode. New Holland has an advantage in troops, but not all where it needs to be, but Maurits has dispatched just about as many as he needs to be able to take everything. If he can keep this up & make some good moves, it may not be over for them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 570</p><p>Caitlyn: Akaitcho was in the capital, sharing drinks with diplomats & business leaders from across the world. A diplomat from New Holland asks about what the plan is with Seneca. Akaitcho avoids the question before an advisor takes him aside & tells him about the loss of Kaoto’. He shrugs & returns to his drinking, before moving into the streets. The streets were surrounded by tall buildings, almost curving around the group, almost caving in. Someone slips out a pack of half-and-half, & passes one cigarette to everyone. As Akaitcho lit it & took a deep inhale, the skunky & metallic taste filled his lung, as he quickly let out with a stiffened cough. He smiled, knowing everything would be okay.</p>"

Despite working tirelessly over the past thousands of years for his people, for the glory, he finally could feel the reaper over his shoulder. It was a familiar feeling, somewhat comforting in its inevitability, somewhat horrifying in its implications. He took a sharp inhale, & demanded his remaining troops to the capital, & to strike at Epuyen. He would not leave until the city was lost, & he would not give up. He would die as he lived, fighting.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn: Carlos Chávez, born out of the elite in Bavarian circles, loved music, & he loved it so much that he was always searching for new sounds & ways to make something new. In the death of the Mexican empire, a large number of refugees fled to European countries, including the Faroes & Bavaria. In this time, he was able to discover new instruments from the area, & begin to incorporate them into unique compositions with traditional Bavarian music. He would eventually lead the Bavarian National Symphony, & start to incorporate international sounds into the music played. From there, he was able to use this influence to meet with other musicians in various places, often followed by military units to keep things clear of what the government wanted him to represent.</p>"

It won’t be if Saba cannot return troops north, as Sierra Leone’s army is finally able to bring in the elite infantry, fresh from the Roman war, in order to take control of all of Saba-Da’amat. Good luck Makeda, you will need it.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: “Last call to Collon-Cura!” the words rang across the helicopter, about to reach south as fast as it could get. Puni did not cry, but he didn’t not cry. He didn’t make a sound, but silence said more than he ever could wish to. The vociferous blades cut through these final moments as all anyone could hear. It was over, there was one home left to be in. Maybe a few nights of sleep before death comes to welcome him to what comes after. He prayed, for peace, for understanding, for all that has happened, but is answered with silence.</p>"

They will stay until the island is lost. Just a few hundred kilometers from where María made her last stand so long ago. It felt like just yesterday, & like a fading memory from childhood. A dying world where what joy we once felt in the simplest actions now is just enough to get by. all the joy In life was gone once they came. He made plans to defend the island one last time. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Caitlyn: After their white peace before, Osage had basically no chance of gaining a coastal city. This may be a blessing in some ways, as it is much, much harder to invade from a navy, but they have no power over the ocean, dependent on the Yellowknives. After the war, there was a blockade on Osage cargo passing through Taíno. This led to a cargo leaving through the Yellowknives’ Atlantic port of Kaoto’, which was working fine until there was a war between them all & Seneca, which led to the loss of that port, & blocking both off from the warm Atlantic ports. Despite the fraying relationships they have held, nothing was done, no deals struck, just keeping the elite happy as long as the economy can prop it up.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Turn 573</p><p>Paige: Despite the pummeling of Bolgar, there’s very little chance of this war going anywhere. Neither of them can make any good moves on the others due to how narrow the frontline is without a major breakout. I don’t see it happening any time soon unfortunately, but we’ll see what happens I suppose. Also, the Kazakhs literally have tanks at this point, so that’s not great for Bukhara.</p>"

The nations that once traded with each other, used each other as allies, & relied on each other will soon find their differences inconsolable, & recognize the necessity of violence. They will have to see how history will end once the dust settles, & a new order is founded that is unseen in any time of history.</p>"

It is the top power & they have the ability to field a large army without significant issues funding it. It should have a stable core & ability to take lands without many issues, especially if they can snipe wonders to help keep things stable. Despite the Faroes' busted production & Wahgi’s military, it won’t matter if they can’t sustain themselves in a war.</p>"

There is no hope beyond the first few turns of the next episode. Johan Maurits worked with his staff in the capital, eyes red & his head turning on a dime. They discussed the plan on rebuilding Bora-Bora lands, & his mind went to all that could go wrong. The Wahgi could invade at any moment. There was no peace, even when the words of war were never spoken. There wasn’t silence in silence, only paranoid thoughts on what could happen next. What must I do next?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Paige: It seems that the Faroes are placing a citadel, (this happened a while ago but shhhh) splitting Midtja from the rest of their country. To me it indicates that in the next few episodes, Ume-Sámi may be the next target of Trøndur. While Rijkuo has been hiding in his lands, & not too behind technologically, they are significantly weaker than the Faroes, & they would be a prime target for expansion. Considering their difficulties in maneuvering along the Alps & resupplying, it wouldn’t be too difficult to assume this war may face some difficulties, but considering the Faroes’ highly superior navy & easily accessible coastal cities, most wars will likely be a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Sorry for such a significant delay all, we tried to make it good while dealing with a lot of personal stuff, but it ended up significantly extending writing. Hope that it’s good, & let us know how we can do better. See you all next time, it’ll be great as always.</p>"
