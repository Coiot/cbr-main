    narration: "<p>The Qarmatian and Vijayanagaran navies clash in the open Arabian sea. They use different ships - Krishnadevaraya fielding a mix of Privateers and Frigates while Abu Tahir al-Jannabi prefers Galleons - but they seem equally matched.

    narration: "<p>It happened slowly with the Nivkh. Flailing after the losses to the Thule, support for the ruling party grew worse and worse. Meanwhile, all the people could hear from the south and west was that Goguryeo was more powerful, more productive, more happy. Ever so gradually, the people stopped caring whether Tutin from down the street was a councilor, or whether Chvark from Okha had a seat in the government. They wanted, they needed, someone better, someone who was above the rabble. And in the lands of the Nivkh, there was only one person you could always rely on. Piece by piece, more and more executive power came to rest in the hands of Umu the immortal. Until, one day, just like it was so many millennia ago, he was the sole ruler of Tyr.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Singapore’s lightning attack takes four of the six cities of Hawai’i.

    narration: "<p>Emboldened by their success against a top power, Singapore joins up with the Khoshuts to try and take down Siam. They might have the objective advantage, but most of Siam’s cities aren’t too accessible by sea, so it might prove to be a tougher nut to crack than Singapore is expecting.</p>"

One tepid morning, the civil servants and court attendants left the caravan convoy and headed to the government office in Lukurmata, where the country was being directed from for the purposes of the Tiwanaku war. It was always quiet in Lukurmata, far too many buildings left for the dwindling population, but today it felt somehow even quieter than usual. One Carmen nervously slid open the plastic door, only to be greeted with a disquieting sight. The immortal Moreno, of late representing a capital suburb in parliament, stood alone.</p><p>“The other members of parliament have been… dismissed. I have no need for them anymore. I dragged this civilization out of the dirt with my own two hands, and it seems I will need to do so again.”</p><p>By the evening, the news circulated throughout Ecuador that the sole exalted leader would now be, and indeed had always been, Gabriel Moreno.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Bol’im adds another wonder to his collection. This one apparently increases the effectiveness of defensive buildings in all of the Wahgi’s cities, as if they wouldn’t be enough of a pain to invade anyway. Mount Hagen itself has a staggering defense of 138.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Javraganak makes peace with Pawhuska. Pituffik is now the only one of the once-numerous Thule exclaves left. We also observe the worrying sparsity of the Thule core. That said, the only civilization who could even move against them is the Yellowknives, and they’re otherwise occupied at the moment.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Moving their army to the front, Singapore has fended off the Siamese attack, and is now making some offensive progress against Ratchapuri and Bac Giang. Chanthaburi, at least, looks secure enough to remain Siamese for now. For their part in the coalition, the Khoshuts look to be doing nothing. Great work!</p>"

    narration: "<p>The powers of North America meet, and even in the midst of bloody war, they agree that anarchy is a dangerous ideology that needs to be exterminated. The Qarmatians and Bavaria, trying to make some new friends, unfortunately mistranslate the memo and declare war on Royal Hungary instead.

    narration: "<p>Down in Pampa Koani, they don’t even know they’re at war. They fish and farm and make merry, and think that the lack of communication means that the capital just forgot about them. They may see strange boats off in the distant sea, and be woken occasionally by an strange orange glow in the north, but nothing could happen in sleepy Pampa Koani.</p>"

Come to think of it, Gushi might not have been able to capitalise on the chance to retake Lhasa if he’d stuck himself in the southeast attacking Siam.
