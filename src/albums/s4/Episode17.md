  narration: "<p>BORA BORA!!!!! They are looking really strong coming off of last episode. Can they successfully push on two fronts and Bora Bora their way into the top 10? Probably not this episode but we can dream!</p>"

  scene_title: "First Blood"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene06.jpeg
  narration: "<p>For this first slide, we see that Bora Bora has Bora Bulldozed over the Wahgi city of Tolu, leaving it with a Still-Impressive 12 population. This, however, is likely only the first blow in what is sure to be a heavy-hitting naval slugfest- Wahgi is mobilizing its forces on the left side of the slide, and will likely meet Bora Bora in the sea beyond Tolu. Buckle up!</p>"

  narration: "<p>A shot of the Ikko-Ikki core. Despite allowing Pueblo and Goguryeo to settle on Honshu, Ikko-Ikki has done decently for themselves. Their only hope for long term relevancy lies in joining a coalition against one of their strong neighbors. The Shang war is not going well, so what will it be?</p>"

  scene_title: "Arctic Siege"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene08.jpeg
  narration: "<p>KyzylOrda is the focal point of the Kazan-Latvian war. Though the small, formerly Kazakh outpost is surrounded by Kazani land forces, the presence of the Latvian White Sea Fleet has allowed them to maintain a foothold in the still-standing harbor district. KyzylOrda would be the first coastal city of the historically landlocked Kazani state, and retaining the area would allow for the first Kazani Navy. </p>"

  scene_title: "The Atlas war"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene09.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Sierra Leonese forces surround Marrakech, though the city has a good chance of repelling the advance, due to its geographic position. Flanked by the Atlas mountains to the south, only a strategic 1 tile pass allows an avenue of attack from that direction. No matter the outcome, the battle of Marrakech is likely to be attritional. Rabat, on the other hand, is under a naval assault that, barring further developments, seems bound to succeed in at least flipping the city. Even now, refugees flee from the outer provinces in what remains of the Alaouite Empire, tearing at the economic, social, and political fabric of the state. Due to the allocation of all military resources to the frontlines, the central government in Meknes is struggling to maintain order in the interior.</p>"

  scene_title: "Harappa Harangued"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene10.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The list of nations declaring war on the Harappan League grows, with Shang and Singapore issuing admittedly irrelevant war declarations. With the loss of Mehrgarh and Dholavira, The Harappan League is vulnerable from almost every direction. Only their Great Wall serves as a deterrent against their opportunistic neighbors.</p>"

  scene_title: "Fear of the Finns"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Finns live in the shadow of their two relatively massive neighbors. Their diplomatic corps must constantly hedge against the interests of Latvia and the Sami, and have thus far been relatively successful. Their position, however, is on a knife’s edge. It would only take a moment for the calculus in Riga or Mausjaure to shift, and for the Finns to go from useful buffer state to potential new conquest.</p>"

  scene_title: "Asturican Triumph"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene12.jpeg
  narration: "<p>After a long and bloody campaign over the Pyrenees, the Visigothic colors now once again hang over Asturica. This is a landmark achievement for the Visigoths, who now have broken out of their geographic prison. For those in Dijon, however, the capture represents a disaster only rivalled by the capture of Beaune by Bavaria. Burgundy has lost control of its southern flank, and now likely fears further incursions into its interior.</p>"

  scene_title: "So Close!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>In a shocking twist, The Ecuadorians have signed a separate peace with Tiwanaku, allowing Lukurmata to remain in Tiwanaku hands. This is a major blow for the other members of the Triple (now double) alliance, Bora Bora and New Holland, and it is unclear how much progress New Holland can make on their own.</p>"

  scene_title: "Chevauchée sounds very French for an English unit."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We can see in the center of the screen that Asturica has flipped back to Burgundy, but it remains to be seen who will keep the city in the end. More emphasized in this slide is the English Chevauchée, a Knight replacement that is slightly weaker, but can pillage with no movement penalty, and reduces production in nearby enemy cities. These will likely come in handy in England’s next war with Burgundy. On the sidebar, we see that one civ declaring war on Harappa is relevant, being Bukhara.</p>"

  scene_title: "Balkh on the Border"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene15.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As it turns out, due to citadel constructions, Balkh is in a very weak position to resist a Harappan siege. Time will tell how it will progress.</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Army from the North"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A massive Faroese Army marches on Kayahsuto’ke, but has yet to damage the city. Observers on the sub are baffled as to how the Faroes, a undisputed top two civ, has failed to make any decent progress against the Seneca.</p>"

  scene_title: "HUGE DUB FOR KAZAKHSTAN"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Selkups, along with a number of useless cobelligerents, make peace with Kazakhstan, who survives, albeit in a highly reduced state. The Battle of Kyzylorda continues, with no immediate end in sight.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Kassa Kave-in"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene18.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Mahnovia’s progress towards Latvia appears to have stalled, but a larger force is moving on the Royal Hungarian city of Kassa. They have a non-zero chance of capturing it, It seems. Further north, a large belt of pillaged land marks the previous frontline of the 18 billionth Makhno-Latvian war.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "England"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene19.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A Comprehensive view of England’s core, showing that despite their poor early settling, the the island kingdom has done relatively well for themselves. Given the omnipresent carpet of Faroese force to the North, it would be smart for England to continue focusing its efforts southwards. Carlos Slim, an IRL Mexican Business Magnate, prepares to cross the English Channel in search of new investment opportunities in England’s continental holdings.</p>"

  scene_title: "Grinda-drag"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene20.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Faroe Islands, recently having discovered Compass, has sent their fleet of Grindadraps, their unique workboat replacement, into the atlantic ocean in search of new sources of fish and marine mammals. The north Atlantic on this cylinder is already extremely overfished, leading to an accelerating seaborne wave of emigration from overexploited and overpopulated Faroese cities. The Faroese Diaspora has formed communities in many cities already, both boosting the local economies of states like Visigothia, Taino, Florida, New Holland, Sierra Leone and the Alaouites.</p>"

  scene_title: "Hawaiian Haze"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene21.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A view of the recently-settled Hawaiian archipelago, where Ikko-Ikki has managed to stake a claim to one of many islands. Pueblo control over the archipelago, however, continues to tighten, and it seems likely that in the future these two pacific powers will come into conflict.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Trans-Thai Tensions"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene22.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Singapore declares war on Vijayanagara! While this may initially seem relevant, the presence of an extensive Siamese maritime exclusion zone will likely slow this war down to a trickle. </p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Another update to the Atlas War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene23.jpeg
  narration: "<p>With a concentrated spearhead of swordsmen, an Alaouite counterattack has retaken Tangier! Alaouite power in the region is difficult to dislodge, and it might be in the best interest of Sierra leone to retake Tangier, and peace out to regenerate their forces.</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Bora Bora’s long lost kin."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Patioan Bora Borans, as far as archeology can determine, are the original inhabitants of the Pampas region of South America, having split off from insular Bora Borans some time in the distant past. However, to the current people of the cylinder, this migration is nothing but a legend. With their recent conquest of the Rio Grandese capital and the strategic city of Caçapava Do Sul, they have carved themselves out a small empire in association with, but not subordinated to, the Insular Bora Boran state. There is a large movement in Insular Bora Bora to “reintegrate” the wayward peoples of the Pampas, but that will remain impossible until the destruction of Tiwanaku. The war of the triple alliance (more accurately the quadruple alliance) seems unlikely to dismantle Tiwanaku to that extent.</p>"

  scene_title: "The First successful naval assault on Dai Viet?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Another explosion rocks the city of Thanh Hoa. The Zheng Fleet, fresh off of its meticulous conquest of the Maguindanao islands, seeks to sever the Dai Viet state in twain by capturing the coastal city. In the north, Zheng Tie Ren, their amphibious Pikeman replacement with a plethora of combat and speed bonuses, begin a slow and steady advance towards the cities of Hai Phong and Thang Long. Zheng has seen a notable spike in relevance in the past century, and their conquest of Maguindanao, when combined with their largely symbolic victory over Shang, leads many international observers to think that this war against Dai Viet will be different. Only time will tell….</p>"

  scene_title: "The Wahgi Armada"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene26.jpeg
  narration: "<p>While Bora Bora’s western forces have been severely depleted after the capter of Tolu, the Wahgi are moving a massive armada towards the city of Poutoru. With Bora Bora engaged on two fronts, Wahgi has the opportunity to knock its pacific rival down a peg or two with a swift and decisive campaign. This Armada is being led by George Dewey, an IRL american Admiral who oversaw the Philipine campaign in the Spanish-American War.</p>"

  scene_title: "Indian Border Wars"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene27.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Skirmishes continue on the one-tile Khoshut-Vijayanagara border. This war is mostly a matter of prestige, and it is likely that if it ever escalated to a wider front, it would end promptly.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Dai Viet Disaster"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene28.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Another boom, followed by an extended crashing sound, can be heard by the residents of Thanh Hoa. The Zheng Fleet, having handily obliterated the coastal forts of the city, now unloads a large force that quickly overwhelms the city’s defenses, and begins razing the logistical hub to the ground. While Tran Thanh Tong has already announced a counterattack to retake the city, drawing forces away from the northern front will further weaken Dai Viet’s position. The longer Thanh Hoa remains in Zheng hands, the more damning this war will be for Tran Thanh Tong.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sad Shang"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene29.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Böri Shad, IRL a 7th century Turkic general, now sits in the luxurious military tent typical of one of Shang’s famously opulent and overbloated military bureaucracy. Shang’s military might had once been great, but a succession of defeats at the hands of their neighbors has reduced their territories and strategic position drastically. Anybody with an amount of sense would blame Shang’s defeats in these wars on armchair generals like Böri Shad, who seldom visit the front and are only in their current positions via their pedigree, not their skill in warmaking. Shang’s future is contingent on them being able to cast off this entrenched generation of military decision-makers.</p>"

  scene_title: "Art of War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene30.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Further to the West in Dawenkou, another General, Sun Tzu, of IRL Art of War fame, sits in his office in the Governor-General building. He, unlike the incompetent Bori Shad, is invested in the future of Shang, and seeks to write a theorybook on warfare that will be used to educate the next generation of generals.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene31.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Despite Eswatini’s irrelevance on the continent, they have a sizable presence in the Western Indian Ocean. Horatio Nelson, IRL a admiral in the British navy in the Napoleonic Wars, oversees the construction of a brand new naval base in recently-captured Zahran.</p>"

  scene_title: "Zheng He’s Most Aggressive Voyages Yet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene32.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Just north of the Strait of Taiwan, Zheng He, IRL a Ming dynasty voyager, diplomat, and merchant, is placed in charge of a newly formed flotilla, likely to be soon shipped off to Thanh Hoa.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Grande Tragedy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene33.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A Pair of New Dutch Carracks sail away from the frozen shores of Antarctica, having confirmed that the Rio Grandese presence on the barren peninsula has been eradicated. The site they leave behind, having very recently been a cold but crowded endpoint for refugees fleeing the Falkland and South Georgian islands, now rests as demolished buildings and forgotten rubble. The name of the former settlement, known to babylonian observers, is now lost to time- the New Dutch hadn’t bothered establishing communications with the outpost, and had no maps that included it.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Rabat Ransacked"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene34.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A group of Faroese emigrées arrives bedraggledly within sight of Rabat, known to them as a potential site for resettlement on the West African coast. Rabat, however, was not as prosperous as it had been described to them in the halls of some Greenlandic mead hall. Having run out of provisions, the Faroese were forced to resort to plunder, and with their superior ships and a good amount of surprise, rob what was left of the hollowed-out shell of Rabat of its last riches, and set the town ablaze. The Faroese Diaspora does not always come in peace.</p>"

  scene_title: "Tran Thanh Tong’s Thang Long Task"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene35.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Zheng Military engineers, in their practiced and methodical way of war, construct a citadel overlooking the Dai Viet capital of Thang Long, and settle in for the long siege. Things are starting to look very bad for Tran Thanh Tong.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Omo Gosh!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene36.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Omo, in the minds of many Insular Bora Borans, represents only the first stepping stone on the way to the unification of the two Boras. In reality, their hold on the port is tenuous. Naval forces have been unwisely allocated to the south, and it looks as though Bora Bora’s momentum is starting to wane.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Gyor Offensive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene37.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Rome’s army and navy, coming off of the Mamluk War, are wholly unprepared to engage in the type of warfare that the Gyor offensive has devolved into. Where the Mamluk war had involved calibrated, mobile attacks and counterattacks, the rough terrain of the adriatic coast has made it difficult to advance even a single tile. While Rome’s forces are superior, it is likely that their style of war will have to adapt to achieve success in the Gyor offensive.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Thule Targets"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene38.jpeg
  narration: "<p>In the small hamlet of Sisimiut, Paco Rabanne, IRL a Spanish fashion designer, ponders the epic landscape before him. The Thule have an incredibly strong standing in North America. While their southern neighbors the Yellowknives are a tough nut, a much easier prospect of conquest lies a short trip across the Bering Strait, where the Nivkh lie placidly.</p>"

  scene_title: "Ishtar Packs up Pt1"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene39.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ishtar pushes through the crowded streets of Torshavn, away from the inland city center towards the coastal slums, where miles upon miles of docks and boardwalk shanty towns have been constructed to house the burgeoning population of the Faroese Capital. She has news, not big news, but news nonetheless. According to her contacts, the government in Torshavn is planning some kind of military action against Eswatini, to her knowledge some small state in Africa. While this rumor may not be true, she has a responsibility to report each and every one of her findings to the sub. She is one of very few spies, or as they call themselves “sanctioned reporters” allowed to leave the sub and interact with the cylinder. She can’t cut any corners, or else lose the right to get out of that boring tin can wallowing in Antarctica.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Upon reaching the end of the docks she can finally get a good signal for her transmitter, and is surprised to find that she has received a new assignment. She is to travel to Kazan, the capital of the up and coming empire of the same name. Thankfully, she also receives a schedule for a package to arrive (Via Airdrop, far beyond the technology of the locals) containing massive amounts of money to cover the travel expenses, and a few of the comforts of the sub, like her favorite snack, Salt and Vinegar almonds. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene41.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Bavaria, engaging in a questionable act of perfidy, has taken the time that their peace deal with Burgundy allowed to consolidate their hold over Beaune and rebuild their forces, and has reinvaded Burgundy! Rome also joins in this time, though it is unlikely they will be able to commit much.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Pressed by increasingly desperate news from the front and domestic anarchy, Ismail ibn Sharif has decided to end the Atlas War with a negotiated settlement, ceding not only Tangier, which was saved from utter annihilation by the wayward Faroese only by a hair’s width, but also the port city of Rabat! Freetown rejoices, while Ismail ibn Sharif is left to pick up the pieces in his much-reduced civilization.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Pajchiri, Tiwanaku’s northernmost city and bustling hub of commerce, is on the brink of capture by New Dutch forces. Capitulating the city would make for enough of a victory that New Holland would be able to back out of the costly war, but it is possible that the Dutchmen seek even further gains…</p>"

  scene_title: "Darling Damietta"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene46.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Damietta, a, or perhaps the, Mamluk city on the arid Red Sea coast, has seen relative prosperity for nearly its entire history. The capture of Cairo to the Romans was in fact a boon for the city, in the perspectives of some. They no longer had to pay taxes to the perpetually indebted mamluk government, and were no longer constrained by international import tariffs imposed by Cairo. Damietta was now free to conduct its quiet textile, gold, and incense trades by its lonesome. That is, until the Romans decided that Damietta, despite its isolation, would be a perfect port through which to conduct Indian Ocean trade. Now the charming and quaint city by the sea may have new trouble.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode17-scene48.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Thule, despite being in a powerful position, are not the preeminent power in the western half of the North American Continent. That would be the expansive Pueblo Empire, which has succeeded in strongarming the Thule into giving up Inujivik, along with the whole of Vancouver Island. How the strategic calculus between them allowed for this, nobody knows, but now Pueblo have an even stronger hold on the Pacific.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here, deep within the jungles of Kongo we can see the Pombo, the Ndongo unique Knight that has no terrain movement penalty in Jungles, and does not require horses. This will greatly help in conquering in any direction, and Ndongo needs to do it fast. Their size advantage over their neighbors isn’t growing and they may need to make a play for continued relevance soon.</p>"

  narration: "<p>On the other side of the Pacific, in the embattled city of Pajchiri, another prophet is born. Nostradamus, IRL a French catholic who wrote alleged prophecies, but on the cylinder, just a 15 year old boy, breaks down in the town square raving, screaming, and clawing at his chest. After many minutes of his breakdown he had gathered a small crowd. He told the people of Pajchiri that they were saved, and that the city, regardless of the odds, would not fall. He would later be canonized by the state church of Tiwanaku as a prophet.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back to Australia, we get a look at the beliefs added to Palawa’s religion, Tjukurpa. The text is cut off, and I can’t find any resources online that explain this belief, so I hope somebody can explain it in the comments of the post or something.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yinxu is in resistance for 55 turns. Looking at Shang’s UA, which allows them to murder their own citizens to spawn luxury goods, sending the city into resistance for an amount of turns based on the number of luxuries shang has already, I would say that Shang’s AI is definitely shooting itself in the foot pretty hard. Though they had a great start, Shang seem unlikely to make it into late game. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Latvia has done well for themselves, and, having made peace with Kazan, seem to be handily repelling Makhnovian advances. Latvia’s forces are depleted, however, so it is difficult to see them launching any major offensives any time soon. They would do well to make peace.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In the wake of New Holland’s destructive campaign against Rio Grande, bands of Tehuelche, desperate for even an ounce of additional space from their cold and crowded homeland, make landfall on some of the coldest places on the cylinder. This would be their new home, and they set up their dug-in bungalows into the hard earth, only paying cursory attention to the ruins they shared their space with.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And here is the last slide of the part! Wahgi appears to have given Palawa military access, allowing them to attack from a brand new angle in Kimberley. Mulka seems likely to fall in the immediate term, but who knows how far Palawa can exploit this opening! This has been QuantumBotany, a perennial contributor to the CBRX and full-time enjoyer, and I hope all of you have a wonderful week! Go Osage!</p>"
