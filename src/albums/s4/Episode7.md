  narration: "<p>Hello to all who dare enter the wacky, wild fields of the CBR! Welcome to Episode 7 of this already great CBR. We’ve seen early empires rise and fall, and civilizations once written off staging a Qarmback out of nowhere. What will this newest installment bring? We shall see…</p><p></p><p>If anyone’s wondering about the title, it’s a reference to Hamlet. Not that I’ve ever read Hamlet, I’ve just heard the saying a lot before to reference the beginning of a war or conflict. </p>"

  narration: "<p>All Hail The Weekly-ish Map! But in reality, these maps are so very helpful to me as a narrator to see a nice overview of the map. What cities are new, and what were fit in at the end of last episode? How do frontlines we haven’t checked in on in a while actually look?</p><p></p><p>As for Sonicfan’s in particular, I like how it appears natural and hand-drawn, as well as the dots inside city centers to indicate the city’s original founder. The Qarmatian-conquered Afsharid cities are particularly visually striking, and almost look like eyes staring out of the image at me.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I’m partial to the Osage, and I wanted to include this meme to show them some respect. They were beaten down by the early game, thrown into the thunderdome with the Shawnee, and came out the other side stronger than ever. They’d pushed back the Shawnee and stolen their second city. Yet with a masterful defense (and definitely not because Pueblo are incompetent), Osage have managed to maintain their great empire of…4 cities. Oh. Well then.</p>"

  narration: "<p>At the top, as it will be for quite a while, is still the Faroes. So this week, like last episode, I decided to highlight the biggest gainer: the Dzungars. I’ve been a big fan of them since campaigning (as a member of the Three Oirats) and they’re performing very admirably so far this CBR. Not only have they settled effectively, they’ve established themselves a nice core somewhat where the Avi Mota Empire formed at the end of the last CBR’s first cycle.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene06.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We welcome you to the action with a shot of a couple of new Siberian cities. Minimap watchers would’ve noticed these at the end of last episode, and the PRs noted them in the Latvia slide, but they just show how even the frozen north is now appealing. Latvia now has Jekabpils and Ventspils, while Kazakhstan added Oskemen to their already-impressive empire. Both of these civs are considerably outperforming expectations largely due to scary neighbors failing miserably. It’ll be interesting to see how they develop into the mid game - and see which one kills Kazan. </p><p></p><p>Also, is it just me or is the White Sea a lot bigger this season than it was in X3? I remember Lithuania’s cities up this way were built on what was almost a network of lakes, while there is a legitimate sea up here this time around. That should make for some interesting combat later, and I spy an English trireme in the corner of the screen too. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Korean-Japanese-and-also-southern-Chinese coalition finds its first successIn the battle against ‘traditional’ China, as Goguryeo takes Xinxiang from Shang in what I’ll call a battle of the UUs. Both the Goguryeo unique horseman and Shang unique spearman have been mentioned before, so I don’t feel the need to bring them up again. Descriptions of them are also on the X4 stats sheet if you’re interested.</p><p></p><p>As for the battle itself, the city could still flip but given it’s behind a river from the Shang capital it would be a difficult task. You never know, though, crazier things have happened. Also note that the coalition has covered most of the Yellow Sea in their triremes; I’m expecting Yanshi to become a land-sea flipfest before long.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh dear, it seems Singapore’s fallen for the standard AI trick of trying to attack a city one tile inland with melee boats. I’m not sure if Singapore declared this war thinking they could take Bac Giang, but one spearman against the large Dai Viet army massing definitely won’t do it. Maybe they find Thanh Hoa, which is currently less defended than Bac Giang, but I don’t think the AI will. Prove me wrong, Lee.</p><p></p><p>Also, where is that Siamese fleet going? They aren’t at war with anyone, but that is a fleet easily large enough to take a semi-defended city. I’d be scared if I was Koxinga or Kennyo here.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah, a nice calm shot of Hawaii. There’s nothing going on here yet, but I could, as always, see it becoming a major Pacific battleground. Or maybe Bora-Bora just settle the islands to block everyone else. I wouldn’t put it past them. I personally think Ikko-Ikki will do it in another one of their wacky settles this game (no matter what, they have a goal to never settle northern Honshu).</p>"

  narration: "<p>We see the new Harappan cities that were mentioned in the Power Rankings, this time with an additional one on Sri Lanka. Vijayanagara is looking more and more boxed in by the Diamond Lords, although it does look like Krishnadevaraya (sorry DocIdo) has three settlers out (one’s hiding out in Vijayanagara city), including one heading towards the tip of South India. It will be an interesting battle to watch, to see how similar it is to Afghanistan vs. Pandya from last CBR.</p><p></p><p>I just have to ask one quick thing - where did the Siamese settlers go? Just two episodes ago, Siam had a legitimate expeditionary force down this way, but now it’s just gone. Disappeared. I think those are the two settlers you can scurrying their way back to Bangkok at the top right of the screen, but why weren’t they turned into cities? Was Rama V too scared of Sri Pada to take advantage? AIs gonna AI, I guess.</p><p></p><p>Nazarbayev and Nader Shah make peace, too, concluding our first irrelevant peace of this episode.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We use the settling of Otrar to take a peek back at Mongolia. Overall, a civ that’s been doing a whole lot of nothing. They’ve been mostly sitting back and letting others settle (relatively so for a Siberian civ), thus letting some interesting cities happen - not only the Dzungars’ Hami, but Goguryeo’s reach with Yodong and Baegam. And of course, the seemingly apathetic loss of Old Sarai to Shang. It’s also interesting that what remains of Mongolia’s very small army is massing on the Selkup border - perhaps an invasion is imminent?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene12.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Well this war has changed significantly since we last saw it. Rather than the English threatening to navally seize Amiens, now Burgundy is threatening England’s Norwich! The English navy is scattered and it would be very difficult to lose Amiens here from Burgundy’s perspective. However, at this point, Norwich is completely cut off from any land support from York. Even York itself seems to be the victim of a few probing attacks from passing Burgundian spearmen. </p><p></p><p>Also spot the English settler on Ireland - hopefully it stops there and doesn’t try to explore the Atlantic. The one in the North Sea is interesting too, though -- could that be headed for the northern Dutch coast? Not sure if it’s possible to settle there, though.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Zheng and Shang both realize they are Chinese, share the “eng” sound to end their names,  and don’t want outside invaders stealing too much of rightful Chinese land. It’s also probably the case that both realized they were never making it through the forest/jungle/marsh mix of Central China. They decide to put aside their differences - for now. I have a feeling this rivalry will continue to flame up throughout the CBR. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Yanshi is in the black with an Ikko-Ikki trireme right next to the city. It would be hard pressed not to fall next turn. And yes, I’m getting to the war declarations. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>It seems the Taíno have woken up - and forced Gregor to wake up with them. The Taíno have a scary military, so I’d be pretty terrified if I was Gregor. The thing is, the Taíno fleet is for the most part off the south coast of Xaymaca or surrounding the New Holland settler on the Turks & Caicos. So really, Floridas just need to prevent the Taíno troops, which are flooding the Cuban straits, from landing.  And Big River is here for moral support too, I guess. </p><p></p><p>Oh hey look! Osage got a new city in Engru-Scah-Op-Pa in the Mississippi-Louisiana-Arkansas area. Good for them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Indeed, the English did end up settling Ireland and not doing anything stupid. That’s always a good thing, when the AI makes the obvious right decision in front of them. The Faroese menace is still there, lurking, waiting. Skuvoy’s borders are already massive, and will only continue to encroach on England. </p><p></p><p>In the war, meanwhile, it seems the relief of Norwich has gone surprisingly well. England has managed to break the land siege with a spearman, though in return they fully withdrew from any attack on Amiens. Again, I’ll get over to the DOWs when they’re relevant to the slide.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>And here we see the true impacts of this war declaration. Tehuelche, too, finally awakens from their long South American slumber on the tip. This is in fact their first war this game, coming from the same Bora-Borans who blocked both María’s expansion as well as made sure Tehuelche would be so difficult to kill. Oh and Mexico is on Bora-Bora’s side for moral support too I guess.</p><p> </p><p>I’m not expecting this war to really go anywhere, and I have to wonder if this war was only declared to kill that scout off Patio.  I could see some skirmishes occurring along the river in the neutral zone between the two, but we shall see if I’m wrong and Patio or Caleufu falls.</p><p> </p><p>María’s UU, which you can see clustered in the Caleufu-Comlel corridor, is the Bolas Thrower, an archer replacement which reduces the movement of attacked units. It could be useful to slow BB’s advance across the otherwise open Pampas, but other than that it’s just a cool icon.</p><p></p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Kalmyk invasion of Makhnovia has…fizzled, to say the least, with a big reason being that Ayuka Khan is leaving at least 10 units in reserve south of the Don and only committing 5 or so units to the invasion. The sheer number of rivers in the area doesn’t help either, though. Perhaps the reason Ayuka’s not committing is that he’s too scared of Möxämmädämin coming again for Kalmykian cities.</p><p> </p><p>In terms of the other invasions and wars on this slide, Makhnovia’s war with Latvia has predictably stalled south of Daugavpils. I don’t think either side has enough units or will to take a city, though if any city falls it would be Latvian. Royal Hungary in the west is also pushing back, and has a couple of units within the city borders of Latvia. If Makhno had gone west from Rezekne instead of north, I wouldn’t be surprised if I was talking about how Liepaja was about to fall. At least Makhno has stabilized his borders for the time being.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Ecuadorian wars continue roughly how we thought they would when they were declared: by nothing happening at all. The war with New Holland is, as we expected, just a few skirmishes in the Amazon basin outside of either civilization’s territory. Though I must say, that New Dutch settler north of Ibarra is extremely bold. Meanwhile, the war with Mexico is going nowhere, just as it has for the past 24 turns of its’ existence. San Luís Potosí was settled last episode with only 2 tiles of land access, and Ecuador has decided it’s too hard to invade the city.</p><p> </p><p>Settlers from Mexico and New Holland also dot the Caribbean – it seems the Mexican one is heading for Jamaica, where the New Dutch one may also be going? That’s more in the open Caribbean though, so I’m not sure.</p><p> </p><p>Huyustus has also discovered the best way to counter the inherent weakness of scouts: send them off in groups. That way, if one dies, the other three can run away and keep exploring! They currently have Scout Group 1 in the Gulf of Panama, while Scout Group 2 is right between a few Ecuadorian cities. The scouts near Cuenca and Quito have been petitioning the government to form Scout Group 3, but unsuccessfully so far.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And Yanshi falls! Ikko-Ikki have brought up quite a few more of their triremes from the home islands and Nagashima, and seem poised as mentioned to turn this into a standard flipfest. We’ll see which side’s units last longer, and which side is more willing to fight. As for the Xinxiang front, Shang has effectively cleared out most of the Goguryean units and threaten the city, but I don’t think they brought up enough units of their own. It also seems Shang is following New Holland’s example and using the Brave Settler technique to inspire the armies.</p><p> </p><p>The resistance is Anyang, which we saw was also in Banpo back on slide 7 and I just forgot to mention it, is just proof the Shang UA is working. Daji has murdered citizens in that city to spawn a luxury and generate culture in the capital, Zhaoge. What bloodthirsty actions from a ruler.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We check back in on the Afsharids, who are rebuilding nicely after their surprising loss of two cities to the Qarmback. Bushehr was just settled by Nader Shah, an interesting name to say the least, given how the city is staring down from the hills at the lost Bandar-e-Bushehr. I also count no less than four more settlers, but I’m not sure where they can even go at this point. I think the one in Turkmenistan might be able to fit a city in there, but that would be the only spot that I can see.</p><p> </p><p>You can also see the unique Qarmatian Great General in Bandar-e-Bushehr (the camel icon) which can be expended for Gold and Production in the capital, as well as duplicating when capturing an enemy city and/or holy city.</p><p> </p><p>In war news, Harappa continues throwing units at Balkh. Great job Went-Antu, you’ll definitely take the city at some point…right? You’ve only been trying for…12 turns. All good things come in time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We move the camera slightly northeast to see that the Kazakhstani invasion of Bukhara is going quite well. Herat is already being damaged, with a few Composite Bowmen able to step forward and shoot the city as well. The Nivkh scout and Dzungar spearman are effectively blocking any attempt from Bukhara to outflank the Kazakhstani units, too. I wouldn’t be surprised if the city falls, though knowing the AI, I wouldn’t be surprised if it holds either.</p><p> </p><p>Bukhara hopes they can rely on the services of Kuchkunchi Khan, one of their unique Begs. The Beg is another Great General replacement, which when leaving friendly territory grants all units a movement boost and combat bonus outside friendly lands. Ending the turn in a city under resistance consumes the unit to end resistance and boost production. Kuchkunchi in particular was the third ruler of Bukhara after Shaybani and Kuchkunchi’s uncle Suyunchkhodja Khan. He ruled for some 19 years and reformed the coinage. Very interesting stuff. </p>"

  narration: "<p>We check back in on the Wahgi, in a brief respite and seeming ceasefire in their war with Maguindanao. And, wow are Wahgi devoid of naval units. There are 2 triremes up north off Ambang in what I think is Micronesia or the Marshall islands. And that’s it. Wahgi have as many CARGO SHIPS and EMBARKED WARRIORS as they do actual naval units. How are you this bad at judging your environment Bol’im? To be fair, they have quite a few spearmen and archers on New Guinea, but you don’t need land units when fighting enemies on other islands. </p><p></p><p>I will just note the general lack of naval units everywhere in this shot. There are 4 Maguindanao boats, with one each from Siam, Dai Viet, Ikko-Ikki, and Nivkh. And…that’s it.</p><p></p><p>Also, go check out Orange’s OC on the Wahgi. I’m not sure what characters they represent (perhaps Wario/Waluigi from one of the Mario games?) but it’s a very cool drawing and use of the face in the Wahgi icon either way.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Norwich is actually going to fall here. It’s already in the red, and the siege that I thought was broken just a few short slides ago is fully back up and running again, with two Burgundian horsemen in the English Channel for good measure. The city is in the red and probably poised to fall next turn. Could Burgundy march on York next? I doubt it, three archers is a tough stack to get through, but given how badly Henry bungled Norwich I wouldn’t put it out of the realm of possibility.</p><p></p><p>I have to ask what the heck Henry V is doing. You have 6 triremes. Why are they all up defending York from the North Sea, rather than garrisoning and strengthening Norwich or harrying Amiens? There are no Faroese units in that sea. You would be well informed of any attack. But nooooo, you have to defend just in case rather than helping in the ongoing war on your doorstep.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We use the settling of the new city of Bornu to check in on the eponymous empire of Kanem-Bornu. This empire looks relatively okay in paper, but their stats are in the dumpster. Their lack of military doesn’t help, with only about 2 defending each city. If Saba D’mt and the Alaouites were to start a coalition war, I could see K-B easily squeezed. Speaking of the Alaouites, the army outside of Fez that we’ve seen these last few episodes continues to grow. What could it be doing? Which one of Ismail ibn Sharif’s neighbors will feel the weight of his blade?</p><p></p><p>I laugh every time I see those crazy Sierra Leone Mediterranean cities.

  narration: "<p>The dogs of war are released once again, as the war hawks in Trajan’s Senate have urged him into yet another difficult war with a neighbor, this time Shajar al-Durr’s Mamlukean Egypt. They say it’s revenge for a ‘Cleopatra’ being an anti-Roman agent in their previous wars with Burgundy, the Visigoths, the Alaouites, and Sierra Leone. </p><p></p><p>Rome actually could take a city off of the Mamluks here, something I never thought I’d say about a Roman war. Good for them. Rashid is very exposed, with only a garrisoned warrior and three Mediterranean Sea tiles for the Roman navy to filter through. I don’t think the Romans will go much further, though; taking a Saharan city or Cairo would require a level of land unit investment I don’t think Rome can afford. Messalia’s also a canal city, so even if Port Loko grabs the next sea tile, Rome can still reinforce the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p></p><p>Unique unit time again! Rome’s, which you can see embarked in the Strait of Messina and regularly in Greece,  is the Singulares, a Horseman replacement that gains benefits from disbanding in the capital (teleporting it and civilians to a faraway city) and from being near Barbarian encampments. I don’t think either of these will come into use in the CBR.</p><p></p><p>One more note - apparently Nicomedia, on Crete, is a new city too. Good for Trajan, finding more spots to settle to further dominate the Mediterranean just like every Italy we’ve seen before.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We use the settling of Little India to check in on both Singapore and Maguindanao. Both of these civilizations are developing quite well, Singapore especially given their last-ranked start. Remind me again why the PRs ranked a civ in Austronesia last? Did they forget what happened the last time they did that?</p><p></p><p>To be fair, though, I would begin to be worried if I was Lee Kuan Yew here. Maguindanao has a sizable army on Borneo threatening Chinatown, though neither side has much navy to speak of. Singapore’s still throwing all of theirs in the Very Useful ™ attack on one-tile-from-the-coast Bac Giang, while Maguindanao’s lack of one was talked about back on the Wahgi slide.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This slide gives us a nice overview of the happenings in the Caribbean, between the two wars and settler races for the islands. The Taíno have indeed brought around their navy that had been sitting south of Xaymaca and have damaged Fort San Carlos down into the green, but it seems like more than just initial probing attacks are coming soon. Ecuador, meanwhile, has also managed to knock San Luís Potosí into the green. The only difference between the two cities being that the fort is right in the enemy’s core, while San Luís Potosí is right next to Ecuador’s own core.</p><p></p><p>The settler races also continue. It seems the bold New Dutch settler outside of Ibarra escaped any damage and acquired an escort to…somewhere. There’s also a third New Dutch settler somehow, which has snuck through the Taíno and is headed for the Turks and Caicos. Meanwhile, the Mexican settler I thought was headed for Jamaica is not in fact going there, but there is one more in reserve perhaps to lock the island down. </p><p></p><p>Scout Group Update: Group 1 has headed north to explore the forbidden land called ‘Mexico’, Group 2 has also headed north to see the rumored conflict between Ecuador and this ‘Mexico’ (though one was left behind to explore Ecuadorian Latacunga), and Group 3 has broken up with two attempting to catch up with and join Group 1.</p>"

Time to party, everyone! It seems to be headed for a nice spot somewhere in Michigan, though its options have been quite limited by the new Crow city. And if Thule settles with the southern of two settlers we’ve been following (yes, these are the same that went up and over the Yellowknives), then I think the city is completely blocked.

  narration: "<p>What a bold, bold forward settle by Harappa. In the wake of their Sri Lanka and Maldives cities at the beginning of the episode, Went-Antu throws down Sutkagan-Dor right on the doorstep of al-Jannabi’s Qarmatians. Went-Antu is clearly aiming to have some dominance of the Arabian Sea with these cities, a bold play seeing he has no port cities in his core. As for the new one, the city is currently completely undefended, so if al-Jannabi seizes the opportunity, he could have a nice new Omani port.</p><p></p><p>What is with this episode and massive armies marching in weird directions? This time, Vijayanagara has marched a pretty big army, complete with siege equipment and a Great General, into the unclaimed land in the center of the Harappan core. There’s even a settler, partially hidden by the Roman-Mamluk declaration of war! It will be interesting to see what exactly this task force is doing and wherever it might be going.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In a similar theme to many other slides this episode, we use the founding of a new city to check in on someone we haven’t seen in a while. Saba-D’mt is doing quite well for themselves at the moment, especially given their lack of settling in Episode 1. They’ve recovered all the way up to now seven cities with the settling of Qohaito. The Mamlukean forward settle we were so scared of now looks small and weak surrounded by Saban caravans and unique triremes.

You could have actually lived up to the reputation the PRs gave you at the beginning of this season. Your settling of Baaxawuaashalíko towards Quebec almost confirmed that - despite your bad early game and near-boxing by Yellowknives and Pueblo, you were working your way out of that box. But no. After fighting so long and hard against the equally incompetent Yellowknives to keep your third city, you threw it all away in this free gift to Javraganak.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, we’ve seen the original civ get over city gifts like this before. Take Nestor Makhno’s gift of Ekaterinoslav to Latvia as an example. It doesn’t completely wreck a civ’s game, but does push it back quite far. I just find it funny that this is the city the Crow were defending so heavily but then just handed it over.

That way, the still-strong Burgundian army can push through the units stacked around York. That would allow the Continent to be freed from Islander influence once and for all. In real life, Plater was a Polish-Lithuanian countess who fought against the Russians in the 1830 November uprising. She’s now a folk hero in both nations as well as Belarus, and has drawn comparisons to Joan of Arc.

It’s a pretty good wonder in any situation, making enemies spend extra movement to move through your territory until the discovery of Gunpowder. Given how much Harappa’s cleared out the rainforest in their eastern territory, it essentially serves the same purpose as replanting that rainforest, while making it harder to cross the many rivers in their homeland. I’m most surprised about this massive army Harappa is gathering; if this is all to attack Balkh I’d call it a bit of overkill. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Balkh is still undamaged.

Speaking of those, we can see two important things about the Makhnovian invasion of Daugavpils. First, the Latvian defenders of the city have moved to the Royal Hungarian front, leaving it open if Makhno commits to it. Secondarily, the city is in resistance, showing that Makhnovia’s UA (edited to be that cities have a chance to enter resistance when units are nearby) is in fact working. </p><p></p><p>As for the other wars in the region, Ayuka Khan is still struggling to even get within two tiles of Huliapole, as Makhno seems to have summoned more defenders from thin air.

This is their second-to-last melee unit in the area, however, implying that this might be one of the last flips. The question now is whether Ikko-Ikki can take the city to catapult into a later invasion of central China, or Goguryeo can grab it to put further pressure on Shang from the north. </p><p></p><p>On the other two fronts of this war, it’s all bad news for Sheng. No less than four archers have found their way out of Yoshizaki Gobo, and might begin to threaten Anyang. The possible re-seizure of Xinxiang we saw the last time the camera took us to East Asia has fallen apart, with nothing but a composite bowman and a city in the yellow to show for it. To put it simply, Daji is just running out of units to throw at the front-line against two powers with a combined production one and a half times hers. </p><p></p><p>This is why Daji ordered her Brave Settler to continue advancing.

That Shawnee settler now cannot create a city anywhere in Michigan, if my counting of the tiles and distances is correct. Instead, Pituffik will serve as the second southern Canadian exclave of Thule, to go along with the recently-handed-over Báhkisee.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, though, the settler that created Pituffik isn’t even the craziest journey on this slide. Not only are there  fellow Thule settlers in northern Hudson Bay and Ontario, there is a Faroese settler seemingly coming over from Greenland and a Crow settler poised to head into the Atlantic. I was afraid at the end of the last episode that the Crow would settle in Quebec and block Seneca. Instead, the Crow are just continuing east, into parts unknown. I think Joe Medicine Crow heard of the Brave Settler strategy and didn’t realize it didn’t apply to exploration as well.

Instead, here, Vonya snuck through the taiga, and struck to surround easy pickings: the Kazakhstani city of Aktobe. The city has legitimately zero defenders, and in a trend we’ve seen the past few slides, is already gone for all intents and purposes for Nazarbayev. Even then, the number of workers in the north hides the true dire nature of this war: there are only 4 Kazakhstani military units north of Shymkent. There is a real chance that these workers are simply scooped up and Pavlodar, Semey, and Karaganda all fall to the Selkups. If I remember correctly, there is also an offscreen northern snow city, which could be an interesting possible pickup as well. But that one’s pretty far to the west so I’m not sure the investment would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>The Dzungars joining in this war is also nothing to scoff at. There is a massive army around Uliastai, which could very easily come down from the hills to threaten Astana. At the very least, it means units will be spent defending the capital that could otherwise go to the northern front. It’s also funny because the Dzungars are still at war with Bukhara, so now there is a three way triangle of conflict on the Kazakh steppe.</p><p></p><p>As a side note, it’s shocking to me that both of these countries are still producing useful settlers.

We’ve seen that with Rio Grande in X2, when Marajoara arrived; with the Mohave in X3, when Arapaho came knocking, and in both of those scenarios the power had significant amounts of North American land.

The lack of military units up here also implies that Vonya will probably only take Aktobe, maybe Semey, and maybe some southern cities, probably leaving Pavlodar and the trans-Uralic ports for some other time. </p><p></p><p>Also, because I checked the minimap for other Arctic settlements, I think the Brave Settler strategy from Daji (Shang) actually worked, somehow. The settler seems to have escaped all the way north to the ice cap, where it has plopped down a Shang outpost. Why is that useful? I’m not sure. </p>"

And it’s just a nice 8-city empire in the Sahel, nothing to be too proud of or unhappy about. They might manage to fit one final city in the northeast of this shot, but we shall see who wins that settler race between K-B and the Mamluks. </p><p></p><p>I would say the same thing as I said to the American powers when it comes to doing nothing, but Idris Alawma did just expend a good portion of his military to take Bo last episode. So, he gets a pass. And in fact, given that their best invasion target is either the Alaouites or Saba-D’mt, it would be an actively bad idea to invade. The army in Fez hanging like a sword of Damocles over Sierra Leone and Kanem-Bornu ensures peace on that front, while a good portion of the Saban army is still on the Ndongo front after the end of that war. </p>"

Gaining faith when a Great Person is expended is a good bonus, but I’m not sure whether it works with their faith-reliant UA (Connected cities inflict damage based on faith output). Is the faith output faith per turn, or just faith generated on that turn? If it’s the second, this belief gives Kanem-Bornu a lighting bolt of damage on all enemies in case a city is threatened. Which would be scary, to say the least.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the religion isn’t too impressive, giving a bit of production from the Worship building, pastures (pantheon), and maybe holy sites (Follower), as well as gold from cities and holy sites.

Rumor has it the war started because Elizabeth Báthory thought Makhno wasn’t contributing enough to the Liepaja shared front line with Latvia and sent him a strongly worded diplomatic letter to that effect. Makhno was of course insulted by this and, egged on by William Slim, declared war on the Royal Hungarians. In real life, Slim was a World War I officer serving in Gallipoli and Mesopotamia and the commander of the Burma campaign in World War II. He later became the Governor-General of Australia.</p><p></p><p>In game, the newest front in the Eastern European clusterfuck looks like an immediate regret for Makhnovia, as Hungarian units around Kassa could threaten Mariupol. I don’t think the city is that threatened by the assault, especially given Latvian units could also attack the Hungarian spearmen. But I’ve been wrong before. </p><p></p><p>As for the other ongoing wars, Latvia-Makhnovia is basically in a state of ceasefire at this point, with one Latvian swordsman perhaps fighting a couple of Makhnovian spearmen. In the west, Latvia has pushed the front line one tile back towards Komaróm. Congratulations, five units sacrificed for two tiles of territory liberated. Meanwhile, Ayuka Khan has continued withdrawing from the aborted assault on Huliapole. If Makhno were to then attack, he would get hit with a hornet’s nest of archers and chariot archers, so I wouldn’t be surprised if Makhnovia-Kalmyks II devolves into a stalemate as well. </p>"

No. This war is contained to the very small two-tile passage between Siam’s northwestern colony and as such, nothing much will really come of it. Both Chandragiri and Dege are well enough defended as to not be in danger, and the narrowness of the pass means not many units can be shot at or attacked by either side. </p><p></p><p>I will apologize to Siam, I didn’t realize Ayutthaya could be settled there.

There are a few outposts scattered over huge areas of nothingness, open ocean and land just waiting to be colonized. One thing you can’t say is that Mogadishu is lacking for space; I count 6-7 more city locations solely on what’s in frame. One thing you can say is that they’re lacking the will to settle it.

Then, later, the Dzungars stabbed Kazakhstan in the back and declared a joint war on them with the Selkups. But instead of attacking their new enemy, Galdan Khan has decided that his ancient hatred of Bukhara overpowers his ability to (if he commits his army) march on and take the Kazakhstani capital.

Yet Charles the Bold has decided the best way to do this is by sending units to encircle York like he did Norwich. Just one problem: York is considerably better defended, and thus, I can’t see the encirclement (and thus the attack) succeeding. Meanwhile, there is a chance a single English trireme could flip Norwich back to the English colors. If that does happen, the nearest non-engaged Burgundian melee unit is the warrior down in Autun. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of Autun, while we can’t see that front, it’s clear Burgundy took the threat seriously given the number of units headed south.

Logically, therefore, Tehuelche has begun rushing their unique archers north as reinforcements to guard the city. The suicidal warrior charge across what can now only be described as the River of Blood also serves to slow down the BB attack on the new city. We’ll see how well it goes, but I think (especially given it’s on the south side of the river) the city will most likely hold. </p><p></p><p>While these two minor players are duking it out, other civs are coming in to steal territory around. Big River has (as expected) settled Pelotas on the Islas Malvinas; with so few naval units on this side of the South Atlantic the city would be difficult to take. Tiwanaku, meanwhile, has a settler on the coast south of Atacama which may settle, as well as another just behind it. That could lock Bora-Boran South America out of any contact with the home islands, as well as blocking any settlement expansion of the colony.

With so much empty land nearby, closer towards the Yellowknives, the Thule still have only 7 cities (reminder of Pituffik on the Great Lakes).

With just seven cities sat on the edge of the taiga and with middle-of-the-pack science and production, they risk falling into the depths of mediocrity just as so many Karakorum-centered civs have before them. To avoid this, Sorghagtani has decided to send her entire army…north to the Arctic to escort a single settler to its new city location. Maybe the army is going somewhere, possibly to attack the Selkups from behind, but it was at the same location at the beginning of the episode so I’m disinclined to think so.

  narration: "<p>Vijayanagara settles Mangalapura at the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, emblematic of where the civ as a whole is standing right now. They’re by far the bottom dog in India, well below Harappa and Siam and significantly lower than the Khoshuts in both Power Ranking and overall situation. With just 5 cities and very few expansion options, the dream of a powerful southern Indian empire is rapidly looking like it will not be fulfilled in X4. </p><p></p><p>As for the war declarations and peace treaties…Rama V declares war and joins the Kazakhstan coalition. How interesting. The Mamluks finally manage to make peace with Pontus and stop the random attacks and pillages into Cairo. Good for them. And…oh. The Sword of Damocles has come crashing down on Idris Alawma’s head. The Alaouite army in Fez is marching on Kanem-Bornu. We won’t actually see the outcome of the invasion this episode (why I’m okay mentioning it here) but it’s definitely something to be excited about for next week. </p>"

  scene_title: "The End of Attrition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene83.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The War for Fort San Carlos seems to be coming to an end, as both sides run out of units. Gregor Macgregor is down to just three warriors near Fernandina and a trireme in the Bahamas, while the Taíno have two triremes, one attempting to flip back the city for a final time and one locked in battle with its Floridian counterpart. At this point, I’m inclined to believe Gregor will hold on to his (very devastated) city at the cost of most of his military. I can’t see the Taíno mustering up enough forces to retake the city again, as even if the boat next to the city can flip it, the Floridian trireme will arrive to continue the cycle one more time. </p><p></p><p>I think Fort San Carlos was Agüeybaná’s gambit to get back into this game, and it just barely didn’t work. At this point, I think him and his civ will be stuck on Caribbean islands, waiting for a bigger fish to come around and swallow them up. </p><p></p><p>Kanawagas also seems to have been successfully saved by Seneca, as Osage at this point is only able to pepper the city with archer shots, not really decrease its health below the yellow. So close and yet so far for the Osage.</p><p></p><p>Say hello to the now twelve Tiwanaku scouts this time!</p>"

  scene_title: "I’m Back…Back Again"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene84.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Maguindanao are back for what seems to be the umpteenth time in an attempt to capture Korn. It was apparently flipped offscreen numerous times last episode, though Mag left it alone for most of this one. I don’t really think three triremes will be enough to take and hold the city, given the forces we saw in the Yanshi and Fort San Carlos battles. Ultimately, it might just be an attempt to extract a better peace treaty out of Bol’im, but I guess we’ll see. </p><p></p><p>Uh, Yagan…why hasn’t Minj been captured? The Wahgi have one trireme and one catapult in the city and your forces have managed to put as much of a dent in the city as Vonya’s have to Aktobe. I thought you could be marginally more competent, with your actual melee units and not just horsemen, but no, Wahgi is just as impenetrable as Kazakhstan. I won’t even chalk this up to a bad war record - the Noongar effectively destroyed Palawan hope at being the sole rulers of Australia just a couple of episodes ago. It’s just that for whatever reason this episode (outside of the Roman capture of Rashid), the easiest cities to capture have turned into the hardest of eggs to crack. </p>"

  scene_title: "Like the Sands of the Sahara"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene85.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Mamluks make peace with the Rozvi, a war neither of them needed and thought about committing to even less, and we take the chance to check in on our favorite Egyptian girlboss. Somehow, the war Shajar declared on Kanem-Bornu might actually go somewhere as Idris Alawma sends a detachment to actually seize Minya. I expect this city, given its undefendedness and eight combat strength, to fall as easily as Rashid. I’m not sure why K-B aren’t using these units in the west against the Alaouites, but I guess we’ll never know. </p><p></p><p>If the city falls, the Mamluks will be left on very few cities and even less hope. They’ll have just four cities, no army, and surrounded by hungry neighbors like the Alaouites, Rome, Pontus, and Saba-D’mt, it doesn’t look too good for the future. Their stats also won’t help carry them out of the irrelevance bin, as they’re in 56th place with 31 effective science (The Taíno, for example, have 51). So perhaps the Rozvi peace deal was an acknowledgement that Shajar al-Durr too is condemned to the same situation Changamire Dombo finds himself in: nothing but an afterthought. </p>"

  narration: "<p>We return to South America to check in on the Tiwanaku, who we haven’t seen too much of this episode. They’re doing quite well for themselves, with the recent settle of Atacama I mentioned back on the most recent Tehuelche-Bora-Bora war slide. They also have the settler out to the south, poised to expand their city count to 10 very productive and well-defended mainland cities. Overall, an empire from the Andes that looks very powerful and easily able to carry this power over to the midgame. Though I must say, why are they building so many scouts? You can see Scout Group 4 beginning to form north of Ojjo. Why? Why do you need four whole Scout Groups if they’re all going in somewhat similar directions, Huyustus?</p><p></p><p>Big River also makes an appearance on this slide, with their little three city empire. Wow, do they look small when compared to either New Holland or Tiwanaku. Any invaders would have a hornet’s nest of units to get through, but there are simply so few cities that I think Big River would still quickly lose any war they got into.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sad Medicine Crow"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene87.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As the penultimate slide of this episode, we return to the source of its greatest mistake: the Crow, gifting the city of Báhkisee to the Thule for absolutely nothing. The Crow thus became nothing more than a line of a civilization, with barely enough units to defend their capital and second city. A stark juxtaposition exists between them and the Yellowknives, who currently own most of the Canadian north sweeping into the US Pacific Northwest and sit on eight cities in frame alone. This is your reminder that the Crow were actually winning a war against the Yellowknives just a few short episodes ago before giving up on taking Ti Cho. </p><p></p><p>Other than the showcase of how far the Crow have fallen and Yellowknives have risen, I guess this slide also shows a DOW on the Osage from the Yellowknives for approximately no reason. The Pueblo and Crow serve as buffers between the two North American civs. However, the Thule also declared war on the Osage a few short slides ago. Could these war declarations signal the start of a second anti-Osage coalition?</p>"

  scene_title: "Balkhing at the Opportunity"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode7-scene88.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We end the episode on another shot of a civilization ineptly trying to take a city: this time it’s Harappa, who tried for the entire episode to take the basically undefended Bukharan city of Balkh. They never could, as shown here. In fact, I think this push down into the green is the most damage Harappa has done to the city all episode. Hopefully Andreas Prokop can help Went-Antu break through. Prokop might be Prokop the Great of Bohemia, a Hussite general who led a portion of the army during invasions of Saxony, Plžen, and Nuremberg. Or he might just be a cell researcher. You take your pick.</p><p></p><p>That concludes this episode of the CBRX Season 4. Thank you so much for reading my rambling, often strange and long-winded narration. I hope it allowed you to understand the slides in a somewhat comprehensible way. Have fun, good luck, and live your best life until the next episode of the CBRX Season 4…next week!</p>"
