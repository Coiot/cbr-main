  narration: "<p>Hello again to all you guys, gals, and nonbinary pals, it is I, Orange/Orangechrisy/that depressed catgirl back once more with fifth episode for the fourth season running, thank you Coiot for letting me keep this tradition going (woo nepotism). Anyways life kinda sucks and I tend to fuck things up but somehow I’m graduating uni soon, woo. Who let me get this far? Who knows, but whoever it is they need to get their license revoked, or something. Anyways don’t worry there will be more nonsense like this in this episode!</p><p></p><p>So, with that out of the way, prepare yourself for an episode of incoherent ramblings, awful references, and a whole lot of bloodshed (I hope, I don’t read ahead so who knows, not me)!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have Sonicfan’s slightly misnamed episode 5 4 map showing all of the civs in all their glory besides Faroes since Greenland has sunk into the murky depths below. We have now had four episodes and four maps made by four separate people (though two of the maps were made for the start before episode 1), if this trend continues then perhaps everyone in the community will have made a map in a few seasons.  </p>"

Post the random shitty memes you think up, they’re great! Make the narrators have to actually have to choose what to put here! (Also make more civball comics I like seeing ones that aren’t just my own)</p>"

But it’s alright Cloudy sleeps too late so I got them in, and it’s fine since I haven’t read the episode yet. :3</p><p></p><p>Anyways Faroes are kinda popping off, there were a few tests where they just dominated and had these cool as fuck empires and it seems we might be getting one of those games, yee to the haw. The memory of Iceland (bestland) runs deep.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Finally, the action, I think, well it’s supposed to be here. Instead it’s Baldwin IV, the King of Jerusalem (through conquest during the crusades) who wore a metal mask because of leprosy. What a guy. This time he’s here to help fight something much more hideous: Burgundians. The heavy forests of Germany have really made it a struggle for Bavaria to make their attack, but I can still hope. Maybe with the great general bonus they can have enough strength to push through and get units to actually surround the city. Please Bavaria, prove our initial beliefs wrong, dominate Europe like the catboy you are.</p>"

Anyways Rozvi is at peace stuck between Ndongo and Eswatini who are at war, though it’s a fairly limited war. Their main avenue of fighting is between NHLagano and Kabasa but nothing is happening there, and definitely not enough fleets for anything, or trying to squeeze through Rozvi’s cities which is also not really happening. Honestly, Eswatini should just turn and attack Rozvi at this point, take back their city, have some fun, still lose to Ndongo, just have a good time.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Dzungars are sitting pretty pretty, 5 cities out and two on the way. No real threat from any surrounding civs and a nice defensible land. Though, it would be fun for them if they marched on Mongolia, united with their non-Oirat brethren, and started really making a go at a new Mongol Empire. But alas, that’ll have to wait, cause they got time, time they are using to settle. </p><p></p><p>Also Mongolia attacks Kazan, but they aren’t near each other.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Maguindanao continues to knock down the walls of Kuno, and really Wahgi has no chance at stopping it. The real question is whether Maguindanao will try to go for Korn as well or if they will keep their conquest here. It would be fun to see Wahgi further knocked down though, so I’ll hope for it. </p><p></p><details><summary>Orange Insight</summary><p>Anyways, I forget if it was mentioned last episode so I want to point something out that got some discussion on the discord (which everyone should join if they haven’t wink wink nudge nudge): Maguindanao has managed to choose what might seem like middling beliefs for most, but are actually quite powerful for themselves. Namely, they get a lot more faith, though it’ll take some time to build up to. This is important because Mag gets a big bonus for having more faith per turn, all naval units get a combat bonus based on their faith output. They are currently at 82 faith per turn which is granting 8.2% strength boost, after 100 faith per turn it decreases and there is an ultimate 33% strength bonus at around 500 faith per turn I believe. While there isn’t much of a buff now (triremes get only like, +1 strength or so rn), this will just get bigger and bigger. In addition, Mag gets an extra trade route when converting a capital for the first time, and once the Kuta (their unique castle) is built they get more xp based on the number of cities of their religion. While the map is going to have so many more religions than the last royales, Mag does have a religion that is good for spreading, and they’ll be wanting to do that quickly. </p><p></p><p>So basically glory to Mag may they beat up Wahgi, settle more cities, and become the faith pirate juggernaut they are meant to be!</p></details><p></p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode5-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The migration to South America is in full swing! They should probably build some more settlers to secure their islands (Wahgi is slowly encroaching, as you can see with Tolu), but they should also build more settlers for South America, not like Tehuelche is using the land. But two things of note here:</p><p></p><p>1. BoraBora’s population is pretty fantastic, only Faroes have more and they have two more cities, also resource bullshit (I love resource bullshit just to be clear). So far of the slides so far the highest pop city was Mag’s capital at 12, same as BoraBoraBora’s. But BoraBoraBoraBora has a 15 pop city, definitely one of the largest on the cylinder so far. With these, they are getting a lot of science so are doing quite well.</p><p></p><p>2. Pompeii, the city engulfed by a volcano and totally not the Roman general Pompey, is here leading the BoraBoraBoraBoraBora army east to South America! It’s quite the strong army, so their lands will be very safe soon, and perhaps even can take a Big River or Tehuelche city.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A few beaten, broken, and bloodied archers flee the falling city, their brothers-in-arms with spears cut off from them, unable to be saved. They had defended til their knuckles were red and their faces black with dirt, every inch a grueling battle against a force so large they couldn’t help but feel no hope. But they fought on, holding each bit of ground until their legs could hold on no longer. Pushed out, defeated, hungry, anger in their eyes. Their home was gone, but they were not. All they needed was a moment’s breath to be able to fight again, just a moment, they couldn’t afford anything more. </p><p></p><p>Also Thule decide rather than attacking the empty Yellowknives backside they would join the attack on Crow, who they can not reach, lol.</p>"

This time it’s appeasement for Ecuadorian and North Holland expansion on the coast and a continued refusal to settle more of the islands. Someone get this guy out of here…</p>"

  narration: "<p>Bukhara very quickly knocks down Elista to red, and it’ll definitely be taken immediately. Kazan is not having a good time and good, they shouldn’t, they had a strong spot and consistently did well but I didn’t care about them therefore it is enjoyable for me when they do poorly. Or to put it another way: Lmao.</p><p></p><p>Kalmyks also have a fourth settler out, no idea if that was here last time I’m too lazy to check, but they got a spot above them they can settle, and down south of Lagan. Hopefully they can get those settled so that they can have at least, some chance. Or they could get in on the Kazan attack, something.</p><p></p><p>Also Makhnovia is sending an army east, and okay I have had to check last episode now because the infosheet current wars tab wasn’t updated and now I can confirm that Kalmyk settler hasn’t moved since two turns ago at least. Anyways Makhnovia isn’t at war with anyone but that army is heading east in big numbers, so they will also probably join in against Kazan soon too.</p>"

With that out of the way, Ecuador has been pretty quiet so far, but they have two settlers out so are gonna have a nice expansion boost soon. Maybe it’ll be enough to make them a decent contender, who knows. </p>"

A six city Saba, from the horrible start they had, well it’s quite impressive. Maybe they will be the power of East Africa no one thought they could be. But I’m still hoping for Mog…</p>"

Anyways Khoshuts have two settlers still in their lands, Harappa is finally getting another settler out and it’s looking to block Khoshut expansion west, and Dai Viet has a settler far too west for it to settle, they’ll need to figure something else out there. Honestly I’m quite rooting for the Khoshuts to do well, maybe if they can get an army out and go take that city in Bengal they can break out of the Himalayas. </p>"

Just, go take a ninth city from Osage, it’s yours Po’pay, make it so. Then maybe take a tenth in Ni-o-sho-de, just as a treat. </p>"

On a more positive note for them, they finally built another settler to send north because their southern settler has just been stuck not moving, but they might be a bit too late… There’s a Faroes settler in Denmark and if they settle where they are then Bavaria will have one spot to settle, at Hamburg, but if Faroes goes one tile south then Bavaria is completely shut off. Now if that does happen they do have one more chance, there is a spot they can settle just to their east above the foxes east of Munich. A five city Bavaria would be so nice to see…</p>"

Maybe I should’ve done a Korn reference as a slide title but I don’t know anything about them so oh well.</p><p></p><p>Wahgi responds to this by building another settler, the freaks.

Well at least it makes them more prepared for if the Afsharids attack, or if they want to go fight Vijayanagara easier. Though honestly, at a previous slide there was a warrior in their lands and they don’t have one here so either they upgraded then built or had some units move, because if they haven’t moved then they really just got a whole whopping three units from it. Come on Harappa use your production more wisely.</p>"

So first of all the Afsharids have another settler out preparing to settle on the Tigris and Euphrates (come on Qarm you need to build settlers your cap is 14 pop oh my goddess). They’ll get there soon and get a nice 10 cities, but not for long.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the Fertile Crescent is the main subject, good ol’ Pontus, with a settler, and a whole lot of Scythed Chariots. The Scythed Chariot is pretty interesting, it replaces the Chariot Archer but instead has a melee attack, iron requirement, less movement, much more strength, and, most importantly, passively damages adjacent units with less experience. So these are gonna be beasts on the frontline, so that soon to be Afsharid city is going to get just absolutely ATE.</p><p></p><p>Also in this slide we see that the Mamluks finally got another settler out, they desperately need to settle some more cities to escape their fate as a two city rump with no production. They have so much land available, and sure most of it is desert, but they need to settle it now before it’s too late.</p>"

Maybe they can send a unit up north to Sweden before Ume Sami settle it, but I doubt it. Sucks for Ludwig you needed to better use your settlers, you could’ve settled Denmark ages ago if you didn’t sit your settler in Northern Italy for so long.</p><p></p><p>Faroes is just further securing their lead, this is a great outpost and a strong forward position for any future invasion on Ume Sami, or any of the mainland Europeans really. In one of the tests I had seen, I think by Iris (hi Iris) Faroes had a great empire that went through Northern Europe and south through Africa but like skipped much of Western Europe, was funny, I hope they do it again. </p>"

  narration: "<p>A single breath was all they needed, a single breath to gather the strength to pull the string to launch the arrow to strike the Yellowknife spearman’s side to kill him where he stood. To take back their home. The spearman brother to the north followed suit, charging back into the city before arrows got him too. Yet, was it worth it? A few bows and spears in a broken and destroyed city, the sound of fire all around, the taste of blood on everyone’s lips. The stench of death in the air and in their minds, never leaving. It was horrible, but it was theirs, safe, for now, until the next push. They hoped reinforcements would arrive before they collapsed and couldn’t defend any longer, yet they could hardly finish that thought before their bodies slumped over in exhaustion. Safe, for now.</p><p></p><p>The Yellowknives don’t have any nearby melee units so it really is safe for a while, unless Crow decides to not send reinforcements at all which would be dumb but they haven’t really yet so who knows.</p>"

Guess I was just hoping they would continue some shenanigans and not be attacked, but alas. With this, Kanem-Bornu is almost certainly going to take Bo in about two turns if not just one turn, but what I find interesting is that they have started this war with a lot of units past Bo. Maybe their strategy was to block Sierra Leone units from being able to send reinforcements before the war declaration, or maybe they just thought Bo was as good as theirs already so didn’t even need to try. Either way, Bo will fall, I’m not sure what else will.</p>"

Though, seriously speaking, their settlements outside of Japan are probably good actually, no one else has threatened to settle Japan yet so technically they are still in the clear, and getting these settlements down quickly means that they already got staging outposts in a number of continental locations.

Anyways a war between the two might go in Noongar’s favor right now, which would be good since if they wait much longer then Palawa will just keep getting further ahead. Maytim is not defended at all and Kriwa only has a few units, Noongar doesn’t have too many units but they have enough. They gotta start making moves now before it’s too late.</p><p></p><p>Oh I’m dumb they also settle Ballardon- out in New Queensland, that’s really nice.

With how little Seneca has settled, this is just the beginning of a massive North American Faroe Empire, one that doesn’t even need mass conquest to form! As one of the biggest Mk2 Iceland stans, it is nice to see the dream alive.

Shang doesn’t have any units ready yet, but they have moved two of their settlers out to the southwest and look to settle, but they are completely undefended so if Zheng notices they might be able to stop them. Overall though, I think Zheng is just gonna waste more units, they wasted a ton trying to fight through the hellish path to Thang Long (like seriously, to go from Anping to Thang Long they have to cross a grassland, two jungle hills, and a marsh/hill, along with three rivers, and from Fuzhou isn’t much better. That is just, an awful war to fight. No idea how BV had thought they might be able to overpower Dai Viet when they had to go through the worst invasion terrain possible.) So with that, I think Shang is just gonna grind up their units and leave them weak again, maybe Ikko Ikki can invade this time, give them something fresh.

  narration: "<p>The British fleet has arrived to attack Emerita, poorly, only got one tile of water access, they’d have better luck going a bit further south and attacking Barcino. Meanwhile the Visigoths have gotten their Gardingo UU, replacing the horseman the Gardingo yields culture when promoted, gains a level when present for the founding of cities, and may settle cities with all military buildings available at level 4. Now, sucks for them but they can’t settle anymore in Iberia. That settler in Asturias can’t settle because Asturica is too close, there’s nowhere to settle on the northern coast, and there’s also nowhere to settle around Toulouse in France. If they want more cities they are gonna have to start crossing the oceans, but they got no navy to speak of.</p>"

On one side of the continent we have Yagan’s Noongar, here with a hefty force of mostly consisting of archers and Gidjiboryls, which replace the spearman and cost no movement to pillage, along with doubling stolen civilians, they have Maytim already surrounded. In the other corner is the Tarenorerer’s Palawa, down on land but up on the sea, Tarenorerer is gonna want to play safely so that his superior production can kick off, and he’s also gonna want to get that settler to safety QUICK otherwise that’s just two civilians for Noongar. This is certainly a battle for the ages folks. </p>"

In the meantime though, Ume Sami settle Likssjuo in the south, got another settler soon to settler the tip of Sweden, and another settler heading north to the Fjords. In addition Latvia is getting a settler near to St. Petersburg.

They’ve just dwindled their forces without making a proper move, deciding to make peace rather than continue the fight. Sucks for them since they had just gotten Ferdinand Foch on board, the Supreme Allied Commander on the Western Front during WWI. He led a number of important defenses against the Germans and led the Hundred Days Offensive that won the war. Now he’s here, working for the Germans, unable to plan out his next war winning move.</p>"

Wahgi in turn decides to say fuck dying and instead sends out settlers, trying one more time to settle the spice islands and assert that they are here to stay.

Their fingers calloused, hard like stone. Their arms ache, every pull of the bowstring bringing pain to their overworked muscles. Breathe in. Breathe out. Fire. Why are they still here just to suffer against an endless enemy? Their arrows near useless against the walls of Ti Cho, the only harm is to their own bodies. Breathe in. Breathe out. Fire. They can never stop, not as long as the command exists. They must repeat their actions over and over, the bows made to be part of their bodies, an amalgamation of wood and fiber and flesh. Breathe in. Breathe out. Fire. No rest for the saviors.</p><p></p><p>The Yellowknives found Necha Go Do on the coast of Lake Superior rather than on the Hudson Bay, and it’s immediately harassed by a few Crow units. They also settle Ek’ati Ndi on the northern coast. Thule is also sending over settlers, three in fact, and honestly they might just be easy pickings for the Yellowknives. That lake, either Great Bear Lake or Great Slave Lake, is gonna make it hard for Thule to reinforce these cities, and they’re right next to the Yellowknives capital.</p>"

Maybe this is the chance the Taino are looking for to expand, become the military behemoth they were meant to be.

But Palawa thinks they will follow what so many others have done so far, and bring back their settler so it can help in the fight. Like there’s a spot to settle up next to that Vijayanagara trireme, but no, they gotta bring the unit directly next to multiple Noongar units. Brilliant planning. Pinjarra is also taken down to green by the Palawa navy, but I don’t know if it’ll be enough, Noongar has some boats they can fight with along with an archer shooting down, but Pinjarra has two water tiles of access so they might be able to overwhelm.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We also get a nice closeup of the Noongar UI, the Cold-Fire Grounds, which yields +1 food and will periodically pillage adjacent land tiles and yield culture when doing so, and if the pillaged tile has no resource a random animal resource will spawn there. Their UA also gets benefits from this, as repairing pillaged improvements gives a burst of food. All three of their uniques involve pillaging, it’s quite nice. Palawa also has some pillaging in their UA, as pillaging trade routes and improvements can upgrade the pillaging unit and grant a tech boost if the enemy has discovered the unit’s upgrade, though Palawa has more techs than Noongar so I doubt that will come into play here.</p><p></p><p>Also while here, Latvia peaces with the Finns for nothing, Rome peaces with Sierra Leone also for nothing.</p>"

And their founder gives some nice faith. Taino will be getting a lot of faith, and will be able to spread that faith quite far, but all of the meaningful bonuses will be something everyone can feel.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Don’t believe we’ve seen this yet, but it’s the religious map! Here we can see how there’s little religion going on in Europe, only the Ume Sami have something really and it’s stuck up north. Africa has some religions that haven’t expanded at all. Northern Asia is super empty. Both Australians got their own but have yet to expand. South America also remains unexpanded. </p><p></p><p>The religions of note are clearly Dai Viet’s Mahayana which is really expansive and it doesn’t even seem to be enhanced yet, but they get a lot of faith from their marshes and are using them to spread to Siam and Zheng. And Pueblo’s Kachina which has expanded to all of Pueblo’s many cities though not much else yet, they have two buildings which is always good and some other nice bonuses. These two religions have a huge head start on everyone else, the only other major one is Ume Sami who will probably be able to expand a lot due to the lack of anything else in Europe. </p>"

And Rezekne is quickly being surrounded and hopefully taken unlike last time. Makhnovia also has a settler in a valid spot to settle so they better do that before the Kalmyks click the button first. This is a bad move for Latvia, they are quite strong but their units just aren’t in the right places to defend, and the land between the two empires is too forested for them to defend quickly. Makhnovia can also put the two cities into anarchy while their units are nearby, making it so they won’t be able to produce defenses themselves.

The Palawa attack on Pinjarra, their only real move, is getting bogged down, a Noongar trireme has gotten in the way and they got two archers off the shore that can shoot, I don’t think they’ll take it.
