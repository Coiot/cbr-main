  narration: "<p>Hello once again it is I, Orangechrisy here, Bora-Bora fan extraordinaire and creator of that one comic (please guys I need you to also make comics even one-offs they are always so wonderful to see!). I’m in a new place yet still can’t even get an interview for a job with my degree, which means I have all the time in the world to do a narration. Yet still I have started on Saturday rather than earlier despite Coiot getting out the images on Tuesday. </p><p></p><p>With that said, I hope I don’t lose people when I do a fair bit longer narration than episode 43, sure this may just be an episode filled with the barren irradiated wastes of what was once a world of great civilizations (not you Wahgi), but within each bombed out husk of a city stands the history of people who have been given the unfortunate position of existing in our little war game. So I hope you’ll enjoy. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Something something good job me something something I haven’t done it yet something something. You know how it goes by now, just a nice pat on my own back. But on the topic of my comics, I’m always envious of the comics others make, like NopeCopter’s, because they’re always so great and it’s so nice to see what other people do. Feel like I need to get a better grip on my humor next mk. Though ideally one of my own civs gets in again (pls) and I can once again do a more focused comic rather than an area wide one. But I don’t even know if that would be better, who’s to say. Why are you still reading my messy self reflective thoughts?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Look I’m not the biggest fan of Singapore it’s gotta be said, they feel like just a worse Timor-Leste it’s gotta be said. But you know what I do love? Someone kicking in the teeth of Wahgi. So here they are, fallen only 4 places down to 7th, when really, with that performance, they should be dropping much faster. 50 cities down. How many this time? They can’t hold on. They have no tech. They are still deeply in debt. They only exist through a UAV carpet. You best believe I’m gonna dance on their grave.</p>"

The city was destroyed in the last few slides of the last episode, but here we can see the proof. The blacked out ruins of the Khami Customs Houses sticking out of the dunes like a foreboding eulogy to an empire still standing. Yet it also is one of the last cities that will be destroyed at the hands of Sierra Leone, as they have only a single nuke remaining (sure they can build more, but y’know how fast they use them). Nzinga is still holding on to 15.</p><p></p><p>As a sidenote, imagine whenever I do the > bits as if it's in a terminal, pretend there’s a cool text animation where the lines come in letter by letter like it’s being typed.

  narration: "<p>In addition to their emptying of their nuclear arsenal, Sierra Leone also lost 70% of their army, putting them at the tiny strength of only 73k. This is in comparison to Ndongo gaining 15% to get to 118k, and well, the Faroes still well above 400k. SL is also still at 100 techs, 7 behind Ndongo and 25 til the end of the tree where the Faroes are at. Their city defenses are also abysmal. So with all that, we see the Faroes retake Iberia and XCOM drop into Marrakech. Things ain’t looking good for them, and it’s a wonder how anyone thought they would be getting through this.</p><p></p><p>Checks my own rankings for last episode</p><p></p><p>…Why did I put them 6th?

  narration: "<p>Now you may be asking yourself “Why is that Latvian settler near Ingolstadt?” or “How did that settler even get there?” or “Why didn’t they just settle in one of the bombed out ruins?”. All of these are good questions, but they fail to really get to the heart of the matter. That being, why hasn’t the Faroes taken Munch yet? It’s been in the black for four turns now, at least. Why haven’t they just walked into it? So many mysteries, so little time…</p>"

  narration: "<p>When the people of Jiellevárre saw the bombs coming down they didn’t hide, they didn’t run, they hardly even cared. They knew how they got into this mess, following the orders of Great Queen Rijkuo-maja, the laziest leader of them all. Despite the claim made last time, Ume-Sámi did actually take a city before total war, a shocker I know. But they took a single city off the Faroes in their war back around turn 100. The city was immediately recaptured and Ume-Sámi lost that war, but yeah. Possibly the laziest civ in the royale. And thus the people were also lazy, refusing to leave, perfectly content watching the flashes of light flatten their cities bomb by thermonuclear bomb.</p>"

  narration: "<p>If you were looking at the minimaps lately, Gogurt’s been doing a funky thing up here in the Selkups land. Partially a result of the heavy usage of citadels of course, but it’s an actual pincer move. They’re running at the capital from the northeast and the southwest. With the size of the two armies, I think it’s pretty safe to say that the Selkups are about to be utterly trounced. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Okay so the stats page’s city captures haven't been fully updated yet, it’s up to like 2/3rds through last epiosde as I write this, and I can’t tell city captures for tiny islands in the Pacific for shit, so I don’t know if Tata-whatever fell and was retaken or not. Piwangka was taken by Wahgi back on turn 810, maybe it got flipped a couple times it’s hard to say. Nonetheless, Palawa does seem to generally have more units here, just that, well they have even worse tech than Wahgi does (96 vs 100) and submarines can’t even attack cities. So, I guess we’ll see what the villain and their toady til war end up as. Don’t you guys just love the trope of enemies and lovers? I sure do but also I hate these two.</p>"

  narration: "<p>After their disastrous start to the war, New Holland has managed to claw their way back to controlling nearly all of South America. Their fleet retook the cape while their army of a settler and three workers have somehow liberated Patio. Seeing how weak Wahgi is now, Maurits decides to send his southern army at the Palawa cities instead. They will definitely be able to fight in the area much better than the former toady can, unless Palawa decides to dedicate some serious troops to the east, and knowing Palawa, they suck ass so won’t.</p>"

On the other hand, New Holland could just new Monterrey to dust and then resettle it with that settler on Cuba.

All these cities are down to the black so just need a single melee unit to walk in and rescue the coast for YK, and well there are a few down near Baaxawuaashalíiko, but they are blocking Necha Go Do with units that can’t take cities. This would be the one time splitting the army to try and take multiple cities would actually be useful, gives a path in for melee units.</p>"

I was really rooting for them to beat Saba, they could’ve. They could’ve also done something about eSwatini, or the Qarmatians. They had options, but they were just lazy about it. Failing to make moves when they needed to, never expanding beyond what was comfortable. And so here they lie, in off-brand Belgium (which is already off-brand Netherlands and France) and a city whose name I’ve used to make a joke about gay sex. Is it a fitting end? Maybe. Up to you.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The first real proper fighting between Gogurt and Wahgi is here, in the middle of the Himalayas. And well, it seems Wahgi is soundly losing. They lost Dam (another capital to Gogurt) and are about to lose Lhasa and Nakchu, probably the other two as well right after. Wahgi’s great South and Southeast Asian paradrop play is evidently not winning for them in the long run. They really tried, and did take a lot, but uh, just sucked, and are now losing badly.

These are some absolutely massive cities with some really good wonders such as: Orbital Refinery, Gate of the Sun, Red Fort, and the Pena National Palace. Which give some very nice bonuses (especially the last two there, giving a total of +45% defensive strength for buildings in the empire). Simuay also contains a bunch of nice wonders thanks to Maguindanao, namely the Pyramids and the Great Lighthouse, allowing Singapore to repair and build their improvements real quick, and to move on Wahgi even faster.</p>"

But they are really just throwing themselves to their deaths as UAVs can not at all take cities, neither can those 7 subs near the top. It’s free target practice for New Holland as they take Ichabamba and force Wahgi down to only a couple cities in the south.</p>"

They probably don’t need to turn every single unit involved in the pincer attack towards Hsia but like fine I guess, leave your new conquests less defended, it’s not like the Selkups can do anything about it. From previous slides it seems the Selkups are much more interested in fighting their weaker neighbors to the west than to defend their own lands. Or maybe they’ve just gone fishing and haven’t come back.</p>"

The rampant path to progress has done little to quell the desert heat, and every H-bomb that goes off pushes a bit more heat into the air. It never goes away. I was moving through Nevers, the people here seemed scared. There was a protest last night -feels like there’s one every night- but as always it was slow and weak as these tired and weary citizens struggled against the sun. It feels like proper defenses will never come to this city, the government doesn’t need to worry about discontent when those damned rays are shining down. They don’t understand the threat soon to arrive. Next place I go I’ll make sure it has one of those cyber-based ice generators.”</p>"

Gogurt is still very very strong, and should be able to pretty quickly bring an army down to defend their recent conquest of Zheng. But personally? Gogurt’s gonna be okay, I don’t think they’re gonna get slowed down by this, they are still by far the strongest, and Singapore has other fronts they need to focus on more (like Wahgi). And hey, they’re gonna settle Hainan and really new settles are the true indicator of success.</p>"

Nonetheless, the Bermuda Triangle has taken another victim, strangely through the medium of nuclear fission rather than mysterious fog and ghost ships. In turn, the Faroes who evacuated the area go north and take Chenussio, probably won’t last but might provide enough of a distraction for the Yellowknives to finally take Nundawao.</p>"

With that said, this also means the Faroes will have a much easier time convoying units over since the passage has been made pretty safe, and keeps their western European holdings very safe from threats. </p>"

Mog earlier was 15th I believe. Similar to Mogadishu, Ume-Sámi had promise, and wasted it. While Mog at least tried to do things at some points, Ume-Sámi refused to do anything ever. They notably were involved in fewer wars than the Finns and had only taken one city before total war happened, and they also lost three cities in that. It was in the early 100s, they have literally done jack shit the entire game and their only relevancy was 700 turns ago where they lost a couple edge cities and then decided that was enough fighting for the rest of the royale. I just wish Latvia had decided to take them out earlier on so they could have a stronger base going into the end game rather than being allies until it was too late.

To note, the Bio-Titan has a strength of 140, only beaten by the classic GDR at 150, making it the second strongest unit in the game, unlike Hsia. Though really the debate is between the Bio-Titan and the Nexus given the two units’ many bonuses, it has March and Volley, heals a quarter of its hp on kills, and spawns two Genoswarms (basically suicide bombs that only last a turn) at the start of the turn if it sees an enemy, unlike Hsia. the Nexus on the other hand heals and damages units within two tiles, and weakens enemy units in that same radius, unlike Hsia. </p>"

Nexuses heal the units around them for 10 hp every turn, and I’m not sure if that stacks? It might, but either way, it means that unless Hsia is doing at least 11 damage to that one Nanohive (assuming the heals don’t stack, if they do then the city would need to do at least 51 damage…) to eventually out damage the healing and destroy it so that a Battlesuit can hopefully be the one to sneak in, or maybe do the same to one of the Nexuses but that seems less likely and there aren’t Battlesuits behind those.

I know this process can be strange for leaders when it happens, so maybe something needs to change in regards to memory keeping. However I think overall what she most expressed was fear, she was scared of what was going on and her position in the world and how she could at all protect the Swazi people from this mess of a war, and how even Nzinga, after giving the city back, immediately declared war herself.”</p><p></p><p>>open mdluli_interview_audio.bwav</p><p></p><p>>ATTEMPT TO OPEN “mdluli_interview_audio.bwav” FAILED: FILE UNOPENABLE BY THIS SYSTEM</p><p></p><p>>definition search “bwav file format”</p><p></p><p>>DEFINITION SEARCH FAILED: NO ENTRY IN DATABASE CONTAINING “bwav file format” FOUND</p>"

  narration: "<p>New Holland takes Tangiers, limiting Sierra Leone to just one city on the Atlantic coast. They also have a GDR just waltzing around approaching Bonthe, perhaps it will be what takes the city? Or perhaps one of those Faroese Battlesuits?</p><p></p><p>We can also see here a proper look at the fact that Nevers fell, along with the rest of the northern Saharan cities, and that Ndongo has taken Yao in the corner. They also seem to have turned their settler around (or maybe it died) before it could reach the Ivory Coast and settle in that empty spot. So close but alas. I figure Ndongo will also be the ones to take Bunce since NH doesn’t have anything around, but they are also going for Ngazargamu. This really is a race to see who can get the most of what’s left. For someone ranked 8th currently in the PR they are uh, very close to death.</p>"

Palawa will probably take this city back given the forces they are collecting, though it should be noted they have no air or ranged support, they’d just be throwing melee units at it hoping it falls. (Unlike Ndongo’s melee unit focus, this here isn’t as good because Ndongo has air support, Palawa just has some submarines which are not very useful). </p>"

Elsewhere in the slide, Ndongo looks to resettle Ethiopia and the Mamluks have decided they might as well make a settler too and try to double their city count since it seems no one is bothering to kill them. </p><p></p><p>Also a random note: The notifications on the right just before indicated Saba being forced into wars, but they haven’t been alive this whole turn, but I guess maybe they had a little bit of time when Gogurt had moved but before Ndongo had moved to try to make peace and then be forced back to war?</p>"

The fact that they lost these cities in the first place is really worrying for Singapore, but hey it’s a bit hard for Gogurt to move more units down here quickly to do another push. Also Gogurt settled Unju at some point, Singapore captured that settler in Myanmar, and there’s still an empty spot over south of Pyeonglo if anyone wants to settle there. Feels like Singapore really hasn’t been big on the whole “resettle shit” movement besides Orchard in India.</p>"
