    narration: "<p>My name is u/PlatonofGlaucon4 and I am proud to present to you the latest episode of the Civilization Battle Royale X 4! </p><p></p><p>I've been following the CBR since the very early days. I was a big Buccs backer back in the day. After a few seasons lurking I've come out all guns blazing for Bat'ko Makhno, father to anarchy. </p><p></p><p>As a real life anarchist and historian I've loved watching the Makhnovoist story play out, paralleling our timeline in lots of fun ways. I've been so inspired that I've been providing my own head canon explanations of Nestor’s actions in my Revolution on the Cylinder series. The support I've received from the community spurred me on to try out for narration, and here we are. So if you've ever thought about making some OC, go for it! If not you, then who?So boys, gals, and non-binary pals “Let's get ready to rumble!”</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>In what is clearly a joint effort by Soviet and White propagandists the power rankers have issued a damning condemnation of the great Nestor Makno. </p><p></p><p>Whilst I don't disagree that Bak’to Makhno is facing heavy odds that are getting worse, I simply will not accept that Latvia has a chance of eliminating us. We've beat them before and we'll do it again. Makhnovian troops are among the most battle hardened on the cylinder, and fight with the burning passion of true anarchy. Even if some of them are a little confused in their praxis.</p><p></p><p>That said, things look bad for Nestor, it will take a series of excellent decisions to claw his way free from the jaws of defeat.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>Gregor McGregor rubs his hands in glee. His plan has come together perfectly. His former city of St Augustine has been formally transferred to control of the Osage government, for a tidy sum of course, and the beachfront timeshares, that he retains a stake in, have been sold to Osage investors. He files the documents neatly in a drawer, on top of virtually identical contracts previously signed by his own citizens.</p><p>At his desk he begins to write up new contracts, in English and the Seneca language, chuckling to himself.</p><p></p><p>On the ground his salesmen pour into Seneca lands, telling tales of affordable properties going for a steal. One stops to make inquiries of a Seneca citizen about potential asset stripping in nearby Nundawo.</p><p>“You betcha big man,” the Floridian drawls, “once you win your city back, we’ll send in the team and they’ll remove all the Osage paraphernalia, so it looks just like it did before.”</p><p></p>"

Its notable followers included Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X.</p><p></p><p>Elijah tells the assembled stories of a grim, apocalyptic future. He urges the African civilizations to unite under the banner of the Nations of Islam. He implores them to put aside continental war, and focus on building what he calls “The Mothership”, a technological curiosity he claims will carry the righteous away from the destruction to come.</p><p></p><p>The crowd seem a little underwhelmed by the prospect, claiming science will not save this universe. He switches tact, to lobby for the removal of the imperialist Romans from native African land, to mixed responses.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>In the formerly war torn Bay of Bengal, and to the north in the Koshut himalayas, a zeitgeist of rebuilding and rebirth has taken hold.</p><p></p><p>The Koshuts have enhanced their religion of Bön. So far their observance has focused on the veneration of valuable metals, and growing their borders to acquire such. Unfortunately they lack many of the resources they prize, have struggled to make their conversions stick, even within their own borders, and are beset by pressure from the far more popular Mahayana, founded by Dai Vet. Possibly the only lasting legacy in the region, for the latter.</p><p></p><p>Siam’s completion of the Enlightenment era wonder the Wat Phra Kaew offers more substantive benefits. It provides +20% beakers in the city that constructs it, and +1 doves to religious buildings, further imperiling the Koshut faith. Hopefully this tech boost will allow Siam to make the most of their smaller post-war population, and be able to replenish and upgrade their navy before Singapore comes calling again.</p><p></p>"

According to the latest stats Bön only holds sway in 3 cities, and over less than 40 total followers. In the previous slide only the capital-come-holy city of Dam keeps the faith.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>This slide focuses on Palwa’s great musician Antonio Salieri. In our universe Salieri is best remembered for a probably spurious rivalry with fellow composer and one time student Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The Noongar are no doubt trying desperately to recruit Mozart as a means to eclipse the fame of their own slightly spurious rival.Much like the imagined feud between the two composers, the Noongar vs Palwa wars haven’t come to much so far with neither side able to make significant territorial gains in previous engagements.</p><p></p>"

The general’s confusion deepens.“I’m sorry, could you clarify that a little for me?” “Aye, we’re gonna run into ‘em full whack.” Big Daddy Joe tells him.“But they’re much sturdier than we are, are you sure that’s wise?”</p><p>“You ‘eard me.” Crow troops begin to fling themselves at the fortified city of Báhkisee. The crashes as they bounce off, causing minimal damage, can be heard for miles around. As can Joe Medicine Crow’s rallying cry of “Easy! Easy! Easy!”</p><p>With the Crow fielding a classical era army against a strength 38 city with sparse defenders and no means of resupply this one is truly going to be a slow paced battle of raw power versus endurance.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>Agent Ishtar rubs their hands together vigorously, then pounds them together to dislodge some of the snow caked onto their seal skin mittens. They glance around to see if there is anyone watching. The white snow makes for hard hiding and Ishtar is quickly satisfied no one is eavesdropping. They reach carefully into the pocket of an enormous fur coat and retrieve a piece of hide, marked and sealed.</p><p></p><p>“Get this intelligence to the submarine, as quickly as possible. I cannot stand another day in this frozen wasteland.” As they speak great clouds of white mist issue forth with their words, and the cold stings their throat. The accomplice nods, and conceals the letter in their own furs.</p><p>Ishtar knows that this is low quality information, a Thule war with Dai Viet is unlikely to lead to any great upheaval, but it is the best they have. In this cold place people’s lips remain sealed, their voices frozen in their throats by the cold.</p><p></p><p>There is little to report from Thule’s engagement with Nivkh, the naval battle lines remain fairly static.</p><p></p>"

All Ishtar knows is that the boat is heading south. They have made arrangements to rendezvous with a trader further down the coast. Amongst its other cargo, essential to the Thule war effort, this vessel will be carrying a contact who will deliver long overdue relocation orders to their frostbitten hands. In the meantime Ishtar will try to gather intelligence on who this raiding party is targeting. They may well be taking the scenic route to Dai Viet. But, just perhaps, their ambitions lie closer to home.</p><p></p>"

A few seconds later the speaker feels a point at their back“Who is asking?” Ishtar whispers back.</p><p>“It’s me, Kyaw.” Hisses the Singapoeran trader-come-spy. Ishtar removes the knife from the boy’s back and spins him by his shoulders so they are facing in the gloom of the cargo hold.“I hope you are not as famous as your name implies, fame is a poor quality for a spy.” Ishtar teases the boy. Is there the faintest hint of  blush on his face? It’s hard to tell with no light.“I have your orders, a-and your almonds.” He squeaks.“Thank you.” Ishtar drops a small bag of coins in the boy's hand and dismisses him.Later, upon reading the relocation is to the Ume-Sámi city of Ávriesjávrrie they reflect sorrowfully on a missed opportunity to throw the messenger overboard.</p><p></p>"

    narration: "<p>I’m going to say it; the Faroe Islands are overrated. Sure if they’re happy they have great stats, but when were they last happy for an extended period? The more rebels they spawn, the less workable tiles they have. They also have a tendency to waste production on wonders which won’t help in the long run.</p><p></p><p>They have a top notch navy, but aside from a blitz of Ume-Sámi, which petered out too quickly for my liking, they’ve not shown they can utilise it effectively. Plus the S.E.A and Oceanian nations are pulling ahead in naval tech.</p><p></p><p>They have weaker neighbours, but they have shown little propensity to attack them. Whatsmore, a lot of those neighbours have terrain which nullifies their navy for now. When they've tried war away from the coast they've not been very successful, probably due to massive combat penalties from unhappiness.</p><p></p><p>All of this is illustrated in microcosm in Greenland where their land units are slowly being chewed up by insurgents who are utilising the hilly coast to shelter them from Faroese gunboats.</p><p></p><p>I’m not saying they aren’t a top contender, but catching a gang beating from barbs isn’t a great look for our number one.</p><p></p>"

Theoretically there is enough power here to take a city or two from María, but this relies on coordinated attacks, strategic healing, and effective use of boats to protect embarked units, none of which the AI is famed for.

Zhu would later be elevated to leader of the PLA, and would serve the Communist Party as a bureaucrat until his death in 1976.</p><p></p><p>Having been a victim of encirclement campaigns himself he hopes to bring refinement to the technique as practiced by Zheng. Their previous attempt at this strategy nearly netted them a valuable capital, in Thang Long. Zhu De hopes to perfect the maneuver as he strikes out toward Siamese territory.

As in our timeline where Vijayangram leader Deva Raya II hired Muslim cavalry to teach his troops the art of archery, on the cylinder this has led to a great advance too: the advent of Vijayanagra’s Unique Unit, the Kaijeeta. This crossbow replacement comes with a defense penalty but is stronger on attack, especially when firing on cavalry.</p><p></p><p>Will these bowmen be enough to hold back powerful northern invaders forever, or will Vijayanagara stay true to historical form and eventually collapse under the mounting pressure of external forces?Speaking of collapsing to mounting external pressure; Royal Hungary is able to end some of their ongoing conflicts. Bad luck for them that none of these are relevant wars.</p><p></p>"

Such little progress was being made before it was hard to tell from just this slide.Instead I will highlight the convergence of scouts in Visigoth territory. I may be wrong but I think I see Mogadishu, Koshuts, Tehuelche, Afsharids, and Saba all in Iberia, with either a Broa-Broan or Ndongo scout heading across the pyrenees to join them. Can’t say I blame them, I hear the weather is lovely in that part of the world, although in our reality tourism is a bit of a touchy subject right now.</p><p></p>"

Their Australian land army now consists of a solitary cannon. It does seem to be enough for now though as Minj remains undamaged, and the besieging forces we saw here last part are all but spent.In a similar success Wahgi are now fairly firmly in control of Kombulno, and look to stay that way as they push towards Mulka. </p><p></p>"

I hope one day to be able to capture the battles in motion as they happen.”Maurits is taken with the pictures, but understands little of the jargon.“Ja, heel goed.” He replies. “We will make an exhibition of your work, and agree to fund your further research.”In another remarkable coincidence the real Cecil B.

This must be due to the Pontic UA: defeating units puts enemy cities into resistance. The real shocker here is that it's even more powerful than we thought. Supposed only to affect cities owned, but not founded, by the enemy, such as Kassa, somehow it has managed to put Makhno’s capital, Hulaipiole, into resistance as well. This makes it far more powerful than Makhno’s own ability which, from my experience, switches on and off at the beginning and end of your turn. This means that when the Makhnovoists attack a city they will still be subject to bombardment, and the owner can buy troops on their own turn, even if they cannot finish producing by conventional means.</p><p></p><p>My my Makhno, how the turn tables.</p><p></p>"
