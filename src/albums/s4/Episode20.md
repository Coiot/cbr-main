    narration: "<p>Hello all, and welcome back to Civ Battle Royale X Season 4! I’m your host for today, u/SiegeSquirrel42 (better known as SiegeSquirrel61 on Discord), and I’ll be taking you through whatever thrills and spills our little virtual world has to offer us this week, with a side of rambling anecdotes and probably biased quasi-lore.</p><p></p><p>I started following the CBR around halfway through Mk2 - genuinely no memory of how I found it. This community’s been a very important part of my life for years now, and so I’ve always felt as though I ought to give back to it, in a way. That and I just thought narrating would be fun. (Which it is! I highly recommend it.)</p>"

    narration: "<p>u/Sonicfan0511 provides us with the tile-accurate map, a CBR tradition. Points of interest include the weird Mongolian exclave nobody talks about, the rather sorry state of Dai Viet, Royal Hungary going through a bit of a Trianon arc and a surprising amount of unclaimed tiles in the Noongar half of Australia. (Then again, I guess most of those are just flat desert.)</p>"

    narration: "<p>u/daXFactorZ (who us Discord-ians (not to be confused with Discordians) know as NopeCopter) gives an important reminder. You see, one of England’s UUs, the Chevauchee (a Knight replacement), resets the production progress of cities whose territory it enters. Which, if you’ll pardon my saying so, is busted. But like, in the same way the Qarmatians’ UA is busted - i.e. in a really cool way.</p><p></p><p>To make matters worse for Burgundy, England’s other UU, the Longbowman, replaces the Crossbowman. In other words, this current late medieval/early Enlightenment world means Henry’s pretty much throwing every line of code his civ’s got at Charles. But tech is fleeting - today’s cutting edge could very well be obsolete next week. Better make it count.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Koxinga climbs three ranks, achieving 4th place in the most recent Power Rankings. The reason for this can be summed up in one word: technology. Zheng wasn’t the first civ to get their hands on Frigates, but they were one of the first to put them to effective use with a smash-and-grab strike on the Wahgi. While their navy is worryingly low on melee ships, the Galleass-to-Frigate upgrade is one of the biggest quality spikes in Civ 5, Enlightenment Era or no Enlightenment Era. If there can be said to be a strategy to the CBR, this has to be a core part of it: never neglect your military tech, because it will make the difference between embarrassment and glory. Time and tide wait for no man - especially not when you’re a pirate.</p>"

    scene_title: "Goooood Morning, Dai Viet!"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode20-scene06.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The curtain rises with Zheng’s war with Dai Viet coming to an end. Sure enough, Dai Viet’s been quite decisively rumped. Thanh Hoa remains in the hands of the pirates, with Hai Phong given up in the peace deal (and promptly set ablaze) and Siam holding Thanh Dong. In the end, after all that fighting, Tran Thanh Tong held onto Thang Long after all, but came out of the war with only it and Bac Giang to his name.</p><p></p><p>There’s a concept I’m fond of: “Watsonian vs. Doylist.” It originates from the early Sherlock Holmes fandom: essentially, is it better to answer questions in-universe or out? In a Doylist sense, Dai Viet keeping their capital happened because you can’t give those up in peace deals. But in a Watsonian sense, I’d like to imagine that this was a bit of cruel irony on Koxinga’s part.</p><p></p><p>“You want your capital so bad? You can have it!”</p>"

    narration: "<p>With her army bloodied and her pride wounded by the inconclusive war with Saba-D’mt, Ana Nzinga returns to an easier, more familiar target and declares war on the Rozvi. I can’t help but be reminded a bit of a boxer, having come up short of a title, returning to their gym to spar with an old training partner in preparation for the next tournament. Although, given that the Rozvi are a full era behind Ndongo in most classes of unit, it’s definitely less Ashita no Joe and more Glass Joe.</p><p></p><p>For realsies, though, I don’t like Rozvi’s odds here. Ndongo has them outclassed in every way that matters. Barring an (admittedly very possible) incident of sustained silliness, Changamire Dombo could very well be facing elimination here. While KOing the Rozvi would put Nzinga at risk of a coalition war, it would also genuinely be a great first step on the road to Round 2 with Makeda.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode20-scene08.jpeg
    narration: "<p>I fear New Holland has made a tactical blunder by declaring war on Tiwanaku now. Huyustus has evidently beaten the science-oriented Neodutch at their own game, for Tiwanaku possesses something New Holland does not: Musketmen, possibly the first on the South American continent. While Maurits cannot count on Ecuadorian or Bora-Boran aid like last time (for all the good it did him), he does at least have the Tehuelche in his corner, Maria having already been at war with Tiwanaku for six turns now. In light of this, the Tehuelche and New Holland sign a symbolic peace treaty ending a symbolic war they’d had with each other.</p>"

    narration: "<p>New Holland is not without other allies. Palawa has declared war on Tiwanaku at the same time, and interestingly has an actual reason to be doing so. That reason is named Wilcawain, a city regarded by everyone in the area as an intrusion upon their rightful waters. With Bora-Bora seemingly unwilling to project force that deep into Wahgi territory, and the Wahgi themselves distracted by war with Zheng, Palawa ships are free to move on the far-flung Tiwanaku colony. To that end, they’ve secured a treaty of open borders with the Wahgi. Bol’im pays little mind to the easily exploitable terms of the treaty, preoccupied as he is with an insurgency in the mountains by disaffected nobles.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode20-scene10.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Palawa’s other reason for declaring war on Tiwanaku is no doubt to clear the seas of the irritating profusion of Explorers Huyustus has been deploying to the Pacific. Tarenorerer does not want foreign pseudo-military troops traipsing about her territory like they own the place, and it’s difficult to blame her, really. It looks like the Palawa navy will, for a change, be seeing action in theaters that aren’t Australia.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode20-scene11.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The Finnish nation, well-defended as it is by trebuchets and its unique Kainulainen Huntresses, has frankly missed its window for viable expansion, unless either the Ume Sami or the Latvians collapse sometime in the near future. Truth be told, I think they could take a city or two off Latvia right now, were it not for the fact that while neither civ’s navy is large, the Finns’ trireme fleet is hopelessly outclassed.</p><p></p><p>At any rate, I’m unsure as to what this shot is meant to highlight. Perhaps it’s just for the sake of getting a good look at the Finns, Ume Sami and northern Latvia.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Or it’s foreshadowing. That could also be it.</p><p></p><p>All three of the civs highlighted in the last slide are now at war with Bavaria, as the Ume Sami and the Finns join in on Latvia’s campaign to cancel our favorite catboy Vtuber for… retaking Regensburg. A city Ludwig founded. Fortunately, an apparent lack of open borders between the three alleged allies prevents meaningful collaboration against Ludwig - a much-needed boon for Bavaria fans. Whilst the Hungarian war effort has fallen back to Bavaria’s own borders, the Latvian and Burgundian fronts don’t seem to have made much progress. Then again, this coalition isn’t that old.</p><p></p><p>Kazakhstan doesn’t actually have a stake in anything that’s happening in Europe but hops on the bandwagon anyway. Typical discourser.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode20-scene13.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Panning south across Europe, we see that the defense of Ingolstadt and Regensburg is going well for Ludwig, but may not necessarily continue to do so. More important, however, is the clear focus of this slide: the Visigoths, in a sudden moment of historical resonance, are attempting an invasion of Rome!</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Navy has a clear defender’s advantage, however, with size and positioning on their side. While snagging Carthago and/or Athens would undeniably be a boon to a Visigothic realm in need of redemption after the Asturica fiasco, I personally doubt they have the ability to actually take either. If things go very badly, Narbo might even be threatened, though probably not permanently taken.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Zheng’s frigate fleet in the region of OTL Yap ranks as one of the most advanced navies in the world, but its composition is also its downfall: it’s all frigates. Not a melee ship in sight all the way to Guangzhou. With that being the case, I fear they may run into some trouble taking Ero’ara and holding onto Baiyer. Whilst the Wahgi navy is much less coordinated, and clearly out-teched, its composition is visibly better.</p><p></p><p>Also visible on this slide is Mornmaul, a name that by all rights belongs to an evil wizard’s castle but has instead been given to a small island off the Papuan coast known OTL as Manus.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The turn ticks over, and out on the steppes, Mongol riders clash with forces from Korea. But unlike in real life, these are Knights, and the Mongols don’t have a clear advantage. Goguryeo has a slight technological and material edge, in fact, though the war still seems more or less evenly matched for now. I don’t know the identity of the Mongol Great General near Xiaotun, but the general Gwanggaeto appointed to the front is named: Maeda Toshiie.</p><p></p><p>In our world, Maeda Toshiie was a Japanese daimyo, the head of the Maeda clan and a childhood friend of Oda Nobunaga who grew up to be one of his most loyal and accomplished generals. Interestingly, his old stomping ground of Kaga Province had previously been a stronghold of the real-life Ikko-Ikki.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, we can see two of the Mongol UU, the Ortogh, a Caravan replacement. It generates Gold when starting a turn on a Trading Post or Customs House, it speeds up the production of nearby roads and it does both those things twice as well during a Golden Age.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mogadishu making peace with Harappa is as good a reason as any to take a look at their core, such as it is. Despite high expectations going in, the rise of Saba-D’mt has locked Abu Bakr ibn Umar out of many expansion options, and a general lack of initiative on top of that has left the Mogadishawi empire fragmented. Naval skirmishes are a fact of life, but none seem to be going in favor of anyone in particular.</p><p></p><p>It’s not all bad, though. Mogadishu has begun to produce its UU, the Uwassiye, which gets a combat bonus and buffs trade routes to cities it’s stationed near. It’s also a Caravel replacement, meaning Mogadishu’s naval tech must be at least a bit ahead of their Eswatini and Qarmatian neighbors. (Which is admittedly not a high bar.)</p>"

    narration: "<p>Singapore is not the only civ that has Frigates, not by a long shot, but they are the first I’ve seen with Privateers. Not surprisingly, this navy is making short work of Siam’s unprepared Andaman Islands city of Udon Thani. Samut Songkram and Chanthaburi will be slightly tougher nuts to crack, though, so who knows whether the Singaporean war effort will make it as far as Phra Nakhon? If nothing else, Lee Kuan Yew’s land army is almost nonexistent, which makes defending the canal easier for Siam.</p><p></p><p>Up north, the Khoshut Khanate’s own invasion proceeds, though the meat of it is offscreen. In the Mekong Delta, the citizens of Bac Giang, disillusioned by defeat and cut off from the capital, take refuge in zealotry. I don’t know what the Saba-D’mt ships are doing.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Afsharids end an irrelevant war with Rome, though this does nothing to help them against Vijayanagara’s continued designs on Tabriz. With any Afsharid naval presence long since consigned to the bottom of the Gulf of Oman, the Vijayan Galleasses can bombard the city with only its local garrison firing back. However, as yet they’ve failed to put a dent in the city, and Afsharid soldiers stand ready to take it back should they ever manage to seize it. This war is, in my opinion, still a victory for Krishnadevaraya, but he’d be wise to break through Harappa first before launching a full-scale offensive against Nader Shah. Vijayanagara’s UU, the Kaijeeta, replaces the Crossbowman, so an opportunity to do just that won’t be long in coming - but the second Afsharid UU replaces the Line Infantry, so the window may not necessarily be wide depending on how fast technology advances.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Afsharids deploy Great Merchant Andre A. Jackson, better known as M’Zée Fula-Ngenge and apparently the first diamond company executive of African descent.</p>"

Fortunately, Narawntapu is well defended and the raid is sure to be foiled. Whether Palawa will retaliate is uncertain. Many of their ships are not as ocean-worthy as those of their foes.</p>"

    narration: "<p>All those catapults Ludwig kept building are paying off. Despite being at war on almost every front, Bavaria appears to have most of said fronts under control. England and Burgundy are too busy fighting each other to invade Beaune. Bavaria’s lack of coastal cities has proven a blessing in disguise, protecting Ingolstadt from Roman assault by neutering its vaunted navy. The Hungarian frontline has stabilized just outside of Csejte with Regensburg back in its rightful Bavarian hands. Only the invading Latvians currently pose a serious threat.</p><p></p><p>It is now turn 247.</p>"

While the Mongol attack on Yodong is likely to collapse next turn, judging by the health of those Knights, Goguryeo’s offensive against Otrar has begun to damage the city.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it’s still attacking a city with cavalry, with the terrain against you, and actually capturing it would achieve nothing other than vindicate Sorg for the otherwise ridiculous endeavor of building ships in Lake Baikal.

Moreno makes peace, with Maximilian’s stronghold on the Gulf of Venezuela none the worse for wear. However, it’s not clear what either civ’s next move from here should actually be. Mexico hasn’t got the navy to take on Taino, and Ecuador hasn’t got the army to take on… anyone they border, really. Maybe New Holland. Maybe.</p><p></p><p>All in all, a draw…</p>"

    narration: "<p>Our view is centered on the Adriatic, but the focus is on Martinus Rorbye, in our world a prominent painter of the Danish Golden Age in the early 19th century. In this world, he works on the outskirts of Antioch, painting landscapes and scenes of everyday life in the Greek countryside. Rorbye likes it here. It’s a small world. Life is, more or less, tranquil. But his peace is tenuous, for he’s heard tell of Hungarian regiments crossing the border into Graecia.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, while Rome’s position is strong, to an internal observer it often seems as though the Empire is troubled on all sides. The Visigoths have raided Carthago, and though the city isn’t likely to fall, the fact it could be attacked at all shocked people. The war against Bavaria has seen no progress made, on any front. The news that Pontus and Kanem-Bornu, both neighbors of Rome, have signed a treaty has sparked fears the two civilizations may plot a coalition war. Unfounded fears, but fears nonetheless. Roman happiness stands at 12 - not critical, but neither are the people entirely content.</p>"

Udon Thani falls, and the Singaporean fleet, its small number of Privateers having reached the front, is starting to move on Samut Songkram. However, their land offensive - such as it ever was - looks to have collapsed entirely. I can’t help but wonder how sustainable Yew’s advance is going to be. The citizens of Singapore’s empire must be wondering, too, as happiness is low enough that Udon Thani is being razed. Given that it’s only at 3 pop, it might well burn out.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Wahgi had declared war on the Noongar last episode, no doubt thinking to expand their Australian beachhead. This effort, while admirable, has not gone according to plan in the four turns since war was declared. Initial Noongar raids on Minj were repelled by Wahgi muskets and Cannons, but the frontline has yet to advance past the border. Meanwhile in the Timor Sea, Kombulno has actually come under attack by the Noongar navy. Fortunately for the Wahgi, said navy is half a dozen Galleasses, which means no capture unless Yagan can bring in a melee ship or somehow land a Swordsman on Timor.</p><p></p><p>Were the full force of the Wahgi empire to come down on the Noongar, they’d probably win. But as it stands, this war is a secondary front, with the Zheng invasion being a much more urgent priority.</p>"

This is the Kwik’ii Doo, a Musketman replacement. It recovers 5 HP when starting its turn on a tile with a resource (like that highlighted one is doing), and it has +1 movement.

    narration: "<p>The game ticks over to turn 248, where we see that Zheng has a rebel Knight pillaging about near Chikan and Wenzhou, though it isn’t likely to survive much longer. Perhaps this is a sign Zheng’s wars with Dai Viet and Wahgi are wearing on them. Or perhaps it’s just a Shang unit that went rogue and pulled an EU4 - “Rebels Cross The Border!” The cause doesn’t matter much to Plutarco Elias Calles - rebels are rebels and it’s his job to put them down.</p><p></p><p>IRL, Calles was a general in the Mexican army who got his start fighting with the rebels in the Mexican Revolution. After that, though, he went a bit full-circle, becoming president in 1924 and founding the Institutional Revolutionary Party that ruled the country as a de facto one-party state for the rest of the 20th century. Calles did have some experience fighting against rebellions as well as in them - his efforts to separate church from state during his presidency sparked a full-blown Catholic uprising, the Cristero War.

This would be quite a large-scale war if it were to come to pass - at least in theory. However, neither side seems to have much of a presence on this hypothetical front, engaged as they are with their own wars in Siam and the Pacific.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if we look beyond Singapore’s relatively ill-carpeted territories and at the edges of the slide, we can see several reasons why such a war might not amount to much. The Wahgi have secured Ero’ara with Cannons and are pushing back the Noongar around Kombulno, whilst the Singaporean siege of Samut Songkram has yet to make meaningful progress.</p>"

It’s here, aboard one of the regular supply junks, that Ishtar arrives in the guise of an ordinary colonist. One could easily mistake this for a punishment detail. For some of the Chinese here it is. But not for Ishtar. She’s here to investigate this new settlement, which verges worryingly close to one of the two Babylonian submarines embedded underneath Antarctica. After what happened last time, the Observers are taking no chances - they want to make absolutely sure that they stand no chance of being found out. Ishtar has thus been instructed to keep an eye on the base for a time. Who knows, she might pick up some handy intel from the occasional political prisoner while she’s at it.</p><p></p><p>The ship that brought her here is one of a new breed, built for oceanic travel and exploration as well as combat. This is Zheng’s second UU, the War Junk. A Caravel replacement, it gains XP by the turn while the capital is in a We Love the King Day, and when it promotes thanks to that, it generates Great Admiral points. Not bad, and synergizes beautifully with the Tie Ren and the Zheng UA to produce a steady stream of admirals, generals and strengthened units. Sadly Zheng hasn't got very many of them.</p>"

This will not go well.</p><p></p><p>Also, I’m still looking at Yamashina. Clearly, the monks of Hokkaido, surrounded as they are by potentially-hostile civs, have decided that they won’t have inner peace until they are safe behind stone and steel.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Tiwanaku West Pacific Squadron fled Wilcawain in disgrace and disarray when the Palawa put the colony to the torch, and they’ve been running ever since. The small band of ships, subsisting off a mix of trading and raiding, have made their way across the whole of Wahgi Polynesia, but now, in the Zheng Marianas, their luck has finally run out. Locked in battle with the locals, the Tiwanaku are scattered and taking damage - unless a timely peace treaty comes in, they’ll die, far from home, their wrecks and their corpses consigned to the depths of the Marianas Trench. The best they can hope for is that Tiwanaku will prosper long enough to have a film industry and make a very nice docu-drama about them.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Every turn, the frontline of the Goguryeo/Mongolia war shifts. Try as he might, Gwanggaeto just can’t quite seem to get a concrete offensive focused on one city. In the citadel-riddled border fortress of Yuanjunmiao, Mongolian Great General Joseph Joffre counts his blessings. Today, at least, the perpetually embattled city doesn’t seem like it’s going to fall.</p><p></p><p>Continuing a recurring theme in this season of situationally appropriate Great Generals, the real-life Joseph Joffre had plenty of experience with defensive war. He was commander of all French forces on the Western Front for the first half of World War I, and he was credited with regrouping the retreating Entente to successfully beat Germany at the Battle of the Marne. However, trench warfare proved not his speed, and his failure to achieve a decisive victory at the Somme got him promoted out of the way. The French went through three more commanders before the war was over.</p>"

That being said, I can’t help but notice that Makeda doesn’t seem to have built up as strong a carpet as you’d expect from a major power - she must’ve lost a lot of soldiers to Ndongo. What’s more, her navy (boxed in though it may be) is still composed exclusively of her unique Badans. Those are Trireme replacements! Just because Qarms have terrible naval tech too is no excuse! (You’d still have to get through Mogadishu-owned Hamar Weyne to fight them anyway.)</p>"

    narration: "<p>For all that Tarbagatai has thoroughly stolen the capital of Ili’s thunder, Dzungaria is a very strong-looking civ right now. The Dzungars could perhaps stand to tech up a little, considering their neighbors the Selkups are getting Musketmen and half of their infantry still have spears, but the sheer weight of their carpet will keep them safe for the foreseeable future. If they were to use that carpet against someone right now, I would recommend Mongolia. Sorghagtani is distracted in the east, leaving Beshbalik and Old Sarai wide open. One thing’s for certain: in the CBR, timing is everything. Attack too soon and it’ll fall flat. Make your move too late, and you’ll find that you’ve got no room left to move at all anymore. But strike at exactly the right time, and you might just score yourself a knockout. Which will Galdan Khan’s Dzungars be?</p>"

More than perhaps any other civ so far, Vonya’s people have been enthusiastic adopters of the musket, though as yet they have not had the chance to test their guns against an enemy. The Selkup military is thin on the ground compared to their Dzungar neighbors’ near-total carpet, but it is no less deadly and rather more proven.</p><p></p><p>Also visible are Kazan’s Darughar Conscripts. These guys are made to be spammed: they’re much weaker than the Longswordsmen they replace, but when they’re next to each other, they can attack twice. They also don’t need Iron, but I think strategic resource requirements are turned off in this run anyway.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Two days had passed since the last of the Rozvi army made their retreat from Danangombe. A party of forward observers watched from the bushes in astonishment as Nzinga herself strode out, fully armed and armored, carrying a pike with something stuck on the end. Then, they realized exactly what that something was: Changamire Dombo’s head. Everyone knew it was over after that. The surrender was the next day. Nzinga gave the last Rozvi general a choice: lay down your arms, face execution or go into exile. The general chose exile. He and his men marched into the desert, likely never to return to the old Rozvi homeland. A band of civilians left too, in a different direction, hoping somehow to find a place to settle. But it’s the Renaissance now, and such places have all been snapped up, just as the Rozvi’s cities have been.</p><p></p><p>The Rozvi came in with high hopes, as a recently released civ with cool history behind them. They took a city off Eswatini early on, and for the briefest of moments it seemed as though they had a path to glory. Then Ndongo declared a beautifully timed war on them (which, by chance, I was also here to narrate!) and it was all over the instant it had begun. Rozvi’s rump state period was a tad prolonged, but the end, when it came, was almost trivially swift. Like their real-life successors the Zulu, they ended up being a starter conquest for the southern African superpower of their CBR: the Boers then, Ndongo now.</p><p></p><p>“This is not the end.
