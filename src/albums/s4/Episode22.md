    narration: "<p>Hello, all. I’m Rhoze, your narrator for this episode of the Civ Battle Royale. I’ve been a long-time watcher, but this is my first time annotating the glimpses of the cylinder for you all. I believe this part is the longest thus far in the season (in terms of slides, at least), so grab a snack and get comfortable. Now, shall we begin?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Gregor MacGregor’s desire for profit was certainly a thing to see last time, as illustrated by this poster from the lustrous EmeraldRange.</p>"

    narration: "<p>New to rank 1, Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo is pushing forward on fronts to both his west and east. How far can the momentum carry him, and will he prove his worthiness of the top spot?</p>"

    scene_title: "Kokugaku in lutruwita"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene06.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The episode proper begins as we see a Palawa prophet on Sulawesi. His destination is perhaps Singapore, whose capital still lacks a majority religion. Tjukurpa, the Palawa religion, has already been established in another Singapore suburb of Tamontaka. In our world, Motoori Norinaga was an influential scholar who promoted ancient texts from Japan itself, as opposed to influences from the mainland. It is a touch ironic, then, that on the cylinder he finds himself proselytizing far from his homeland. The Zheng-Wahgi war rages right next to the defenseless prophet, as Wahgi units are creeping towards Lamitan.</p>"

    scene_title: "Saba Scrap"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene07.jpeg
    narration: "<p>We get some action already as among the usual irrelevant wars, there is an extremely relevant one. Makeda, tired of being told she’s sitting around wasting her golden age boosts, declares war on Kanem-Bornu, her troops already entering enemy borders. Saba-D’mt has a slight military advantage, as well as a clear tech advantage, but she might be outgunned on the frontlines. However, her production stat dwarfs Kanem’s, which should allow her to back up this first wave soon. The terrain around Ndjamena makes invasion tricky, but Minya is on the flat of the Sahara, and looks like the easiest target.</p>"

    scene_title: "Soul of Singapore"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene08.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The King of Soul, the progenitor of funk, brings his tunes to the Malay peninsula. Inspired by the random mountain next to him that everyone agrees is Siamese property for some reason, his songs rally the many suburbs of Singapore in their ongoing fight against their western neighbours. We also see a fairly sizable Ikko-Ikki fleet trapped in Siamese waters.</p>"

    scene_title: "Attack on Zia Harbour"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene09.jpeg
    narration: "<p>When last we saw Hawai’i, Goguryeo had Cochiti in its grasp and was on the verge of taking Zia. That invasion seems to have evaporated, leaving only five boats to contend with quickly approaching Puebloan reinforcements from the mainland. That said, Goguryeo galleons outtech Pueblo carracks, so the fight certainly isn’t over yet.</p>"

    scene_title: "Scamming Too Close to the Sun"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene10.jpeg
    narration: "<p>MacGregor rejoices as the Taino take their turn moving into St. Augustine, expecting to take ever greater profits from his beachfront property. Unfortunately for him, something obviously went wrong in negotiations and Agueybana orders the city set ablaze. The immense happiness deficit that the Taino are in means that it looks set to go through, too. Seeing his condos going up in smoke, all MacGregor can think of is to throw himself, weeping, at the feet of the Seneca longswordsman camping on the outskirts of the city. “Please, save my profits!” he chokes out, his gaunt and tearstained face caked in ash, “You can’t let them burn it all!”. The longswordsman is thoroughly nonplussed, and plans to heal back to full health.</p>"

    scene_title: "Fortresses of the Kush"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene11.jpeg
    narration: "<p>A new turn dawns, and Bukhara tires of Balkh being cut off from their other cities by some vicious Harappan citadelling, and war is declared. Unfortunately, those very citadels make any progress into Harappan territory extremely difficult, and the mountainous terrain certainly doesn’t help matters. Bukhara does at least seem to have open borders with the Afsharids, so they might be able to bring some units around that way for a flank attack.</p>"
  - scene_number: 12
    scene_title: "Autun Attack"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene12.jpeg
    narration: "<p>In only a single turn since we last saw it, the defenses of Autun have been taken into the red by a barrage of English arrowfire. There is even a Chevauchee ready to swoop into the city as soon as it becomes weak enough. Maybe this will finally be a turning point in England’s long wars on the continent.</p>"

    scene_title: "Mongolian Miracle"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene13.jpeg
    narration: "<p>In a reversal of fortunes, not only does the assault on New Sarai disperse for now, not only does Xiaotun return to Mongolian hands, but even their attack in the north goes through, Varsed falling to Sorghaghtani. Goguryeo forces remain on the offensive however, notably stationing a trebuchet in range of New Sarai.</p>"

    scene_title: "Who Then Brings Anarchy to the Anarchist?"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene14.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Mithridates, realising that his UA is much more powerful than described, feels a little bit guilty and decides to send only five units in the attack on Makhnovia. Even then, the anarchy on the bustling streets of Ekaterinoslav makes it a soft target for the top of the line Pontus galleons. Makhno, so used to spreading discontent among his enemies, is unprepared to have his own trick used against him, and can only field a few flagging crossbows to try to repel the invaders from the far shores of the Black Sea.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Fall of Mehrgarh"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene15.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Vijayanagara’s luck has run out. Harappa has withdrawn open borders at some point, cutting the defenders of Mehrgarh off from reinforcements. Whittled down, we observe the Afsharids taking control of the city with little resistance, merely a single ship left to make a last-ditch effort at reclaiming it for the Vijayanagaran throne. This also scuppers the Singaporean navy in the area, also hoping to snipe it of Vijayanagara.</p>"

    scene_title: "Seneca Expands by 50%"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene16.jpeg
    narration: "<p>After being promised a beachfront condo of his very own, the Seneca longswordsman marches into St. Augustine and puts out the fires, much to the delight of a frazzled MacGregor. This comes at the same time as a Senecan strike force takes Kinngait. It looks likely to hold, with only a small Thule navy left, blocked from the harbour by a wandering scout. The Taino fleet stretches along the eastern seaboard, but strategic settling means tiles to attack from are few and far between. Another assault on St. Augustine might be possible, though. In other news, more civilizations declare war on Harappa, one of them very relevant and the other less so.</p>"
  - scene_number: 17
    scene_title: "Coast to Coast"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene17.jpeg
    narration: "<p>We get a shot of Tiwanaku, shrunken slightly from the coalition against it, but largely holding on. Their unit carpet is looking a touch thin, but it’s not egregious compared to Huyustus’ neighbours. They also field a lot of musketmen, which both New Holland and Ecuador lack. A well-placed Bora-Bora citadel also secures access to the western coast for Puni, although sadly there is not enough room to squeeze in another city. The most relevant part of this slide is on the sidebar: Vijayanagara, frustrated by the betrayal leading to the loss of Mehrgarh, joins the powers declaring on Harappa.</p><p></p><p>Also, Rijkuo-Maja, in her single allotted action per episode, builds a wonder.</p>"

    scene_title: "The Silver Stool"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene18.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Tiwanaku’s war with the Tehuelche takes the form of a measly swordsman being sent to die in the sea. Osei Tutu, sneaking back into the cylinder for a second chance at glory, decides to join the mighty Tehuelche nation on the frontline, sure in himself that he’s picked the strongest and most relevant contender to side with.</p>"

    scene_title: "Krishnadevaraya’s Gambit"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene19.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Krishnadevaraya makes his own luck, as that heroic ship brings Mehrgarh back into the fold for now, although without a well-timed peace it seems destined to fall again. We also see units from both Vijayanagara and the Khoshuts closing in on Lothal, which is barely defended (Vijayanagara has only a single melee unit, however).</p>"

    scene_title: "The Siege of Thang Long"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene20.jpeg
    narration: "<p>A huge Zheng force closes in on Thang Long yet again, Koxinga desperate not to let the capital slip through his fingers. Merely a single Viet melee unit remains nearby, promising that gains made could be more permanent this time.</p>"
  - scene_number: 21
    scene_title: "The Siege of T’Bok"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene21.jpeg
    narration: "<p>However, his desire to take Thang Long could come at the cost of a different capital, as Wahgi units stream toward both Simuay and T’Bok, Bol’im having secured open borders with Singapore. Zheng declared this war opportunistically, but the tide has truly turned now, and all of the former Maguindanao lands are in danger.</p>"

    scene_title: "Palawa Plotting"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene22.jpeg
    narration: "<p>We get a nice shot of insular Bora-Bora, showing off their impressive navy. What’s slightly less nice is the report sent in by the ever-intrepid Ishtar from Palawa’s capital Mutawaynatji. The creeping influence of Tarenorerer is visible around the edges of the image, passing through Wahgi borders to open another potential front. The Palawa ships are slightly lacking in terms of tech compared to Bora-Bora’s however, and Bora-Bora also had the higher military score at the start of the episode. A naval invasion would be a hard fight.</p>"

    scene_title: "Per Aspera ad Astrakhan"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene24.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The Kalmyks sign peace with Bukhara, making them one of the few states fully at peace. Unfortunately, said peace seems destined to be shattered sooner or later, as Ayuka’s units are at least an era behind those of everyone they border.</p>"
  - scene_number: 25
    scene_title: "The French Sky Falls Dark With Arrows"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene25.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The incessant and ever-increasing bombardment from the English bows takes Autun to the black. Desperate for any kind of defence, Burgundy brings a great engineer, Maslama al-Majriti Tapputi, to the frontline. I’m struggling to find who this is in our world - Maslama al-Majriti was a mathematician and astronomer of Cordoba, but Tapputi was a perfumer and chemist from ancient Babylon.</p><p></p><p>Clearly the only logical conclusion is that something went wrong in the process of entering these two into the cylinder, fusing them into a single conflicted body. But one that was very good at building, thanks to their four arms.</p><p></p><p>Also, if Tapputi Maslama al-Majriti is expended for production, all it would take is a single step from one of the many nearby Chevauchée to wipe all that production away, obscuring that the engineer’s sacrifice ever happened at all. I find something deeply sad about that.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Goguryeo reverses the capture of Varsed. Now that we can see this front, though, it’s clear that Mongolia is committing a greater force than their opponent. With some speed, Sorghaghtani might be able to leave this war with a capture. On the other hand, Gwanggaeto’s forces are amassing near a thinly defended Otrar.</p>"

    scene_title: "3-2 to Goguryeo"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene27.jpeg
    narration: "<p>And here’s the other city capture we saw last slide. It turns out a few galleons is all Goguryeo needs to take both Cochiti again as well as another island on the Hawai’ian chain. Both players are wielding scant armies, so ultimate victory most likely will go to whoever can reinforce quickest - or whoever can leverage the best timed peace deal.</p>"

    scene_title: "Makeda’s Misstep"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene28.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Five leaders around the world wake up today and decide they want a slice of Kanem-Bornu. The Alaouites will be hard pressed to reach them through Sierra Leone, but Rome is a potentially relevant foe. However the Roman army seems to be concentrated in the north fighting their other wars, so it remains to be seen whether Trajan can leverage this opportunity. For their part, any advance Saba-D’mt was attempting has dried up, and in fact the Kanem forces are entering the territory of their former city Nkongsamba. Despite the clear tech advantage, Kanem’s sheer numbers seem to have Makeda on the back foot in a war she declared. She needs to leverage that production difference, and fast.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Still unable to breach the Harappan citadels, Bukhara calls upon its unique Beg for aid. It strengthens nearby units when leaving friendly territory - and thanks to those very citadels, there isn’t exactly a lack of enemy land nearby. We’ll see if Bukhara can use this to make any progress though. I have to admit I’m doubtful.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Deciding that the Crow are stretched too thin by their war with the Thule, the Osage declare war to try and take nearby Chichuche. However they don’t have too many units committed, not to mention only three tiles to work with, between Pueblo and the great lakes. Strategos Pawhuska needs more than just strategy to make some gains here.</p>"

    scene_title: "Singapore Surprise"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene32.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Well. The deceptive power of even small numbers of galleons has come up a few times this episode, and Singapore’s navy sees an opportunity. There are no longer any Vijayanagaran units nearby, and Singapore isn’t at war with the Afsharids. Somehow, the victor of the Vijayanagara-Afsharid war for Mehrgarh is Singapore.</p><p></p><p>This is really pushing it if Lee Kuan Yew still wants to be considered a city-state.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Strategos’ strategies have inspired someone who does have raw power. The Yellowknives, who have been rising the ranks, decide to prove it by making a play for the Crow. They’re not messing around - the greatest force, backed up by a citadel, is aimed straight at the Crow capital of Baaxawuaashé.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene34.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Thang Long falls once again to Zheng. Its HP remains low, and the Dai Viet Trebuchet and Longswordsman both still live, so there are almost certainly more flips in store. They are supported by Lampiao, a great general who in our world was a Brazilian bandit. Ironic that he loyally defends his sovereign to the last in the cylinder.</p>"

    narration: "<p>By some miracle, Autun stands, and it would take some work to clear a path for an English melee unit. Emboldened by this, Charles of Burgundy makes the very sane and rational move of declaring war on the Visigoths. The border is teeming with units that would like to see Asturica recaptured. I can’t see a way for Burgundy to escape unscathed anymore.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The sleeping giant of the Faroes finally makes another move. The inhabitants of Sydrugota are actually perfectly safe, a wall of ocean tiles preventing the Visigothic carracks from entering. Trondur’s real goal, despite the focus of this slide, is most likely the errant Visigothic colony in Ireland. If he wanted to, he could probably use his massive navy to take these Visigoth islands as well, but the troops are not yet in place.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mogadishu is gaining their unique Uwassiye, a stronger caravel replacement that gives a variety of extra yields when adjacent to cities with trade routes. This makes them slightly stronger than the boats of the Qarmatians to their north, although fewer in number. They are also just inferior to the galleons that Mogadishu also has.</p><p></p><p>We can also see that Saba has sent a single Badan to attack Belgaum. Great job, Saba.

With the current units fielded, I can’t see Vijayanagara taking the city, only softening it up for the Khoshuts.</p><p></p><p>Side note, but we’ve been seeing several of Shang’s cities leave their perpetual resistance lately.

Unfortunately, by the time he gets there, someone else - presumably the Taino - has torched the remnants of the city to the ground. Refusing to believe his eyes, the destitute scammer wanders, a broken man, around the charred corpses of his dreams, limply placing poster after poster advertising “Your dream beachfront property!” on the blasted remains of walls.

    narration: "<p>Somehow, New Sarai is back in Mongolian hands, and the attack on Otrar went nowhere. Gwanggaeto is back to having no gains in this war. Ironically, he’s having a much easier time attacking rank 13 than rank 27.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Incensed by the death of their cheerleading worker, the five Pontus units move into Ekaterinoslav. This in addition to the Latvian citadels cuts Kassa off from the rest of Makhnovia, a potentially easy target. The Makhnovian army has almost completed its migration to Alexandrovsk, despite Strategos Makhno’s pleas. The soldiers remind him that under anarchy, they are just as important as him, and should be free to fight, or not, as they wish.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Chanthaburi flips back to Singapore. A Singaporean army is also on the way to southern Vijayanagara. Krishnadevaraya was able to reduce Kalibangan to half health, but the assault has evaporated. All told, it seems as if the Vijayanagaran time in the sun is becoming overshadowed by the urban sprawl of Singapore.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The nations of the world, hearing that Dai Viet is down to one city and under siege, declare wars hoping to get a piece of the dying civilization. None of them will be able to reach it. In fact, the only other power that could even try to reach Bac Giang is Siam, which seems content to let Zheng have it. Zheng, for its part, is finally realising that land forces are needed for Bac Giang, so its days seem numbered.</p>"

    narration: "<p>With its navy slowly being extinguished, and no reinforcements in sight, the Nivkh lose both Iglulik and Honsho-Ji. Both cities are still in the red, so some flipping is in order, but with the larger Thule army moving to the front, Umu needs to exit this war soon to prevent any more losses.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Nkongsamba returns to its founder. The Prophet Nagarjuna, in Saba-D’mt’s well-covered core, suggests that Makeda doesn’t think about training units, and should instead spend more time reaching nirvana.</p><p></p><p>I don’t think Kanem can press any further, but they still vastly overperformed considering Makeda was the aggressor here. To the north, the Kanem-Rome front closes silently.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Never mind, Thomas Peters decides his army is good enough right now, and declares a war to clean up the remains of the Alaouites. He holds a hefty tech advantage if not necessarily a numbers one, and Ismail’s domain is split in half by Visigothic citadels. We’ll see how it goes, but there is certainly the potential for the Alaouite run to end here.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Bahkisee is solidly Yellowknives territory now, and both Baaxawuaashé and Chichuche have begun to take damage from their respective aggressors. It looks like the end is closing in for Joe Medicine Crow.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Chaozhou takes chip damage, but Kennyo is still trying to invade with embarked ranged units, so as it stands this is going nowhere. The delay has also let Koxinga reinforce Wenzhou. The Goguryeo fleet still lurks to the north, Gwanggaeto still undecided about whether to commit to this war he was dragged into.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Ogedei Khan leads the defense of Pampa Koani from a terrifying Tehuelche invasion, portraying himself as the only thing between the city and checks notes two (2) units. He’s here on a break from leading his own Mongolia, finding beating down the Tehuelche way easier.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene115.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Now that England owns the Visigoth-founded Asturica, the rest of the Visigothic cities will take damage per turn for as long as Asturica has a unit. This doesn’t even help England, who aren’t at war with them, only softening them up for their other invaders.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Ah, there’s the navy that Ikko-Ikki isn’t using at Chaozhou. Changhua is already in the black, and Guangzhou has taken damage too. If resistance is eliminated, these cities will be hard for Koxinga to reinforce, and seem likely to fall.</p>"

    scene_title: "Scramble For Harappa"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode22-scene117.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Harappa’s capital, Harappa, falls to the yellow. Its defenders gone, the city will fall. But whether to the Khoshuts or the Afsharids seems to be a coinflip. Ganeriwala and Mohenjo-Daro are both also under threat. This may well be where Went-Antu’s story ends.</p><p></p><p>To the top we see that Iglulik and Honsho-Ji continue to flip. To the south, not only does Vijayanagara have a melee unit approaching the weak Mehrgarh, but Qarmatian ships have flooded the harbour, cutting it off from further Singapore reinforcement. Maybe the final owner of Mehrgarh will be Krishnadevaraya after all?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Having been convinced by his advisors that the Rozvi hunt is a really bad idea, Yagan declares war on a much more reachable target - Singapore. A Noongar fleet advances on the thinly-defended suburb of Little India, with Tamontaka also looking vulnerable. With Lee Kuan Yew concentrated on his far west, this has the potential to take a serious chunk out of the extended city-state. However, Singapore is beginning to train ships-of-the-line, the next generation of naval superiority, so it might not be as simple as Yagan hopes.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Speaking of their other invaders, nothing is happening on the Sydrugota front. The Visigothic ships (bar a lone caravel) unable to cross the thin line of ocean, and the Faroese ones unwilling to brave the greater numbers of their foes.</p>"

    narration: "<p>With Simuay back under his sway, Bol’im quickly takes Lamitan, T’bok seeming likely to be next. Kuta Watu is also taking damage, but with Zheng forces actually defending it, it’ll take a while to be worn down. To the west, Bac Giang is also taking damage.</p>"
