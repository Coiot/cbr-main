It possesses a 10% Combat Bonus against other Gunpowder units, and grants adjacent Melee units a 25% Combat Bonus against them.

I'm going to try to keep this eulogy brief, since they're a lot more people more qualified than me, but here we go. In 1 word, I would probably describe them as a stone. They didn't do a whole lot and were very bad at science. They had a successful early war against Khoshuts, did nothing for 20 parts, almost beat the selkups but ended up drawing,did nothing for 15 parts, got demolished by the selkups, then died a forgettable death to Gogyueo. Only wish the Afsharids were the one to pull the trigger.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Faroes have fully taken over Italy, taking a capital in Rome and an elimination in Bavaria. For a civ that was originally ranked 59th going into the season, you could definitely argue they really overperformed expectations. It sure didn't feel like that most of the time. To make it to the top 20 and not ever be in the top half past episode 1 is a real achievement. To be fair,It's not like they never did anything, they were the ones that really killed Royal Hungary, but they also proved how long you can last by everyone ignoring you.</p>"
