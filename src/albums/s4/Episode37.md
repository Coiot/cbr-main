    narration: "<p>Hello and welcome back to the CBRX Season 4! I’m NopeCopter aka u/daXfactorz, new Power Ranker, new-ish modder responsible for Ndongo-Matamba, Rozvi, and Maguindanao (sorry about that), and veteran-ish narrator, here to provide a written account of the brutal collapse of your favorite civs. Don’t worry, I’ll be crying right alongside you. </p><p></p><p>Last episode, Vijayanagara and Mongolia died, Shang un-died, Mexico was faced with a two-front war, Sierra Leone resumed their invasion of Rome, the Wahgi made landfall on South America, and Saba-D’mt gave Mogadishu their capital back (how polite). How will these world-defining wars play out, and what new horrors await? Only one way to find out!</p>"

    narration: "<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/comments/1hivnku/cbrx4_episode_36_map/?ref=share&ref_source=link </p><p></p><p>A map is always a wonderful thing to have in order to really get an idea of the state of the cylinder, and this one by u/Sonicfan0511 does the job excellently. Did you notice just how badly the Finns and Kazan have been Citadelled? Apparently Latvia used their UA to turn at least one Citadel back into a Great General and use it to build another Citadel somewhere else. That’s pretty fucked up, I think.</p><p></p><p>While it’s not exactly visual OC, I also want to give a massive shoutout to two excellent written works: the finale of u/PlatonofGlaucon4’s “Revolution on the Cylinder” series (one of the greatest pieces of OC this season), and the ever-wonderful u/Orangechrisy’s “Under the Thumb of the Titan”, detailing the life of a Bora-Bora woman living under Wahgi rule. Both of these are incredibly well-written and absolutely worth your time (especially if you’re a fan of Makhnovia or Bora-Bora, respectively), so please, please give them the love they deserve!</p>"

    narration: "<p>We begin with Sierra Leone beating back Rome in Africa, a harsh return to reality for them after their miracle victory over Sierra Leone a couple episodes and their decent-enough defense against the Faroes. Rome does have the advantage of more advanced Infantry units compared to Sierra Leone’s Great War Infantry, but they just don’t have the numbers or positioning right now to hold the line - their forces are scattered and damaged, while Sierra Leone has the Agadez-Minya-Bornu front on lock with plenty of reinforcements incoming. What’s worse, Sierra Leone not only has a higher number of aircraft present but also Anti-Aircraft Guns throughout their army, giving them the decisive advantage in aerial combat. Agadir looks like it could be flipped by those two damaged Roman Infantry, but Rome’s going to struggle to hold the line in the long term.</p>"

    narration: "<p>A couple more irrelevant wars against the Finns provides this episode’s opportunity to actually look at the Finnish core. Ant let me just say… wow. Nothing’s changed.</p><p></p><p>Okay, that’s not entirely fair. There’s some good and some bad here. The good: since they last got a clear look, the Finns have upgraded their Musketmen to Riflemen, their Cannons to Field Guns, and their Crossbowmen to Skirmishers, plus they’ve picked up Frigates. That’s some solid progress all around, albeit some 10-15 episodes too late. As for the bad… well, Latvia and the Ume Sami have been absolutely tearing into the Finnish holdings with their Citadels, to the point where the capital of Kirmukarmun has been effectively isolated from the rest of the empire. It hardly matters, since we all know the Ume Sami and Latvia are never actually going to attack the Finns and they’re safe until the Faroes find room to drop Paratroopers on them or something, but this does make life in the sleepy northern kingdom much less enjoyable.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Goguryeo completes the Helios Microwave Power Satellite, a neat little Wonder that boosts the power of Solar Plants in the empire. More specifically, it doubles the yields of all Solar Plants in the empire (+10 base Production, +30% total Production) and damages enemy units that end their turn next to a Solar Plant. Now, Solar Plants require Desert, which Goguryeo doesn’t actually have a ton of… but conquering Mongolia added a good bit more to their empire. Perhaps this was the motive for eliminating Mongolia all along. Still a bit rough for empires like Sierra Leone or the Yellowknives with their massive stretches of desert to lose out on this Wonder, though.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Right, so about that whole “Latvia would never invade the Finns” bit… it seems like the pink giant has finally awoken enough to notice, oh yeah, there’s been some free food hanging over their heads this entire time. Who knew that all they needed was a coalition’s worth of peer pressure to finally do the deed? That, or the Ume Sami are finally no longer threatening enough to warrant keeping a buffer state around for. Regardless, this is going to be a slaughterfest. The Finns, even with their decent carpet, are eras behind tech-wise, they’re completely lacking in air support or defenses, and Latvia’s Citadels give them a straight shot into the Finnish capital. Kalliomaki, Rikala, and Rapolan have some defenses (and Rapolan has the Baltic Sea as a bit of additional defense from land units), but Kirmukarmun and Tiurinlinna probably have a couple of turns, max. Of course, that’s not all that important given the odds of the Finns surviving more than ten turns at all are pretty slim, but you never know! Maybe Latvia will let them keep one city as a gesture of goodwill!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Ojjo and Ichabamba are now solidly Wahgi, kicking Bora-Bora decisively out of the northern Andes. The southern Andes, meanwhile, are more up for grabs. Wahgi’s assault on the coastal city of Atacama has progressed nicely since last episode (probably because they can actually use their Paratroopers now), knocking it into the red and removing all but one of the Tanks that used to guard it. There are plenty of Bora troops on the other side of the Andes, ready to defend their new homeland, but of course it would be best if they could keep the Wahgi from getting a beachhead in the first place. Can they even flip Atacama if it falls with all those mountains in the way, though…?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mexico, stubbornly clinging to the cities that represent their capital’s last line of defense, flip Veracruz and Valladolid once more. Wahgi “peacekeepers” continue to frustrate attempts to maneuver Mexican forces to the front lines, doing more to hinder the Mexican defense than help it, but to be fair I don’t think the Mexicans would stand a chance even without the Wahgi interfering. The bulk of their military is Riflemen. Riflemen, with a third of the Combat Strength of the Yellowknives’ Modern Armor and Mechanized Infantry. Their UU, the Volunteer Corps, is a Gatling Gun replacement, by the way, so it’s not helping much either. Mexico is simply far, far too outgunned to hold the line here even with fairly defensible terrain… but then again, it’s a straight shot to Mexico City and beyond if they can’t, so they need to try keeping these two cities or it’s all over.</p>"

There’s a disable force just south of Agadir ready to contest it, but a small defensive line is beginning to take up position around Mansoura - Rome clearly isn’t ready to just lay down and die. That said, there’s news up north that’s much more grim - while the city has flipped back, Carthago was apparently taken by the Faroes momentarily. That’s a Mediterranean island city. The Faroes are breaching the Alps.</p>"

Aside from that, though, this war has been… shockingly slow to get going. I mean, the only other Finnish city that’s even taken damage is Rikala, knocked into the yellow but still pretty well defended by Finn standards. I suppose Rapolan’s naval defenses have been knocked out, but I think Kirmukarmun actually has *more* units defending it than the last time we saw this front. What’s the holdup, Latvia? Is that classic Finnish defensive spirit manifesting even here?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Not much has changed in terms of borders on the Mexico-New Holland front since the end of last episode, but on the ground, everything has changed. On turn 507, Mexico has a line of Riflemen three or four units deep ready to defend Loja and Guayaquil. Now, on turn 512, the lines have been decimated, and the survivors have fallen back to Latacunga and Cuenca. Only a few token forces remain on the front lines, seemingly abandoned and left to the New Hollanders. That said, though, the work of the Mexican defensive forces shouldn’t be ignored - particularly in the north around Ibarra and Olinda, the New Holland army seems to have taken some notable damage. The remains of the army are somewhat scattered, so even though they’ll definitely be able to flip Loja and Guayaquil, Mexico might just be able to hold out for a little while longer. Maybe. The tech disparity is still pretty absurd, and it’s not like New Holland is out of units or anything.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Well well well, it looks like the Selkups aren’t exactly happy about being humiliated by some upstart to the south - after taking a few turns to lick their wounds, they’re back to have another go at the Afsharids. One problem: they still don’t have open borders, so their invasion force consists entirely of Explorers (who can pass through enemy lands without Open Borders). Sure the northern Afsharid lands aren’t exactly the most well-defended cities on the cylinder, but I kind of doubt this will be enough to beat them even with some air support. Kind of seems like a waste of resources for both of these secondary powers if you ask me.</p><p></p><p>(Fun minigame: try to spot the part of this image that makes me look like a fucking idiot!)</p>"

Everyone loves the Party Tank. In our world, Frank Zappa was a prolific American musician known for experimenting with all sorts of genres and styles, often making use of comedy to get his ideas across. Hopefully he can lift the spirits of the Bora-Bora armed forces enough to keep them fighting for every inch of land in South America - they’ll need the morale. (As an aside, man, New Holland’s core is ridiculously empty! It’s always been pretty empty, of course, but it still catches me off-guard whenever I see it.)</p>"

This is one of the more valuable Wonders of the Future Era, granting not only +2 Production to all Factories and Nanomaterial Plants but also 12 free Nanomaterial resources - given how many Future Worlds units rely on Nanomaterials to be built (such as those spider-tank-looking things around the capital, the Mech Artillery), that’s a pretty solid thing to have.</p>"

Not what I expected, honestly - Kirmukarmun looks way more vulnerable, but it hasn’t even been scratched. Doesn’t Latvia have planes? Why aren’t they bombing the Finns to smithereens? Regardless, both cities look doomed to fall eventually, as the Finns are rapidly running out of troops and Latvia’s army has barely been scratched. It just feels a bit cruel to drag things out this much.</p>"

The Thule ground forces, meanwhile, are… not terrible, I suppose? There are some units there, their empire isn’t totally empty. That said, they’re pretty behind on tech, and I don’t think their Great War Infantry would stand up well to the Yellowknives’ Mechanized Infantry. Even if the Yellowknife border does look comically empty in this shot here. Poor Thule, maybe if they were somewhere that had more invasion targets they’d have a chance at a comeback. At least they have Cilla Black, famous British singer and friend of the Beatles, to cheer them up.</p>"

To recap, the city was gifted to New Holland for peace by the Seneca after they took Chenussio, but then Mexico took Chenussio from New Holland, only to lose it to the Seneca (who were also at war with Mexico) and immediately sue for peace. Now Mexico and New Holland are still at war, and they have a border with Nundawao via the city of Kaoto’, but they don’t actually have any land units to march through that one-tile border and take this random inland New Hollander city. So they seemingly just use their singular aircraft in Kaoto’ to bomb it repeatedly out of frustration. Glorious. Maybe the most impressive piece of bordergore on the map, considering how naturally it came about (as opposed to, say, a Paratrooper drop or a peace deal city nowhere near the front lines). Just an inland city connected to a coastal capture that they promptly lost.</p>"

Not a whole lot of units around. It probably won’t matter, mind you, because Mexico is ALSO quickly running out of units, except they also have ground forces roughly on par with the Finns. It’s not like they can’t build Infantry, either - there’s one right outside Valladolid! Maybe their UA, spawning the “best available” gun unit when they adopt social policies, is spawning the Riflemen in? It’s anyone’s guess, really. Regardless, the Wahgi peacekeepers are at least doing something again, keeping Valladolid somewhat safe from recapture.</p>"

Personally, though, I was blindsided by this development. Coupled with a serious bombing campaign on the northern Afsharid holdings, these Paratroopers (provided they keep coming) might actually be able to flip some Afsharid cities. I kind of doubt they’ll be enough to hold anything in the numbers the Selkups have right now, but that would still hurt. The Afsharids do seem to be trying to bomb the Selkups back, for the record, but the Selkups have Anti-Aircraft Guns to shut that down.</p>"

Narbo seems gone for good, which is a bit of a shame, especially since it gives the Faroes a port on the Mediterranean to continue their assault from, but on the whole things seem to have dramatically cooled down by now. If it wasn’t for the damaged units I don’t think I could even tell the Romans and Faroes were still at war. Celebrating the defense of Carthago is Kurt Weill, a German-born American composer best known for his work on the Threepenny Opera. Perhaps he came from Bavaria in this timeline?</p>"

Rapolan does have a melee unit or two nearby to potentially flip it, but even if it does change hands, the Latvian navy will swiftly take it back. Kirmukarmun and Kalliomaki are also both beginning to take a bit of damage - not a lot just yet, but as the Latvians close in, it’s clear this is the beginning of the end. No more Finnish navy around Kalliomaki, two Landships at the gates of Kirmukarmun, I’m not even sure if a lucky peace deal could save them now. Both cities might just fall in the same turn. Props to that one FInnish Galleon outside Rikala for fighting the good fight, though.</p>"

The city is still surrounded by Wahgi Paratroopers, so I’d expect it to flip right back, but there are enough Bora-Bora units nearby to at least make it a contest. (Maybe the citizens of Atacama would rather the city *stop* being contested, though - it’s already at 1 population, living there must be hell.) Bora is slowly running out of units to hold the line with, but then again, the Wahgi aren’t exactly looking great either. Where are all those Helicopters they swarmed the Pacific with? In fact, how have they failed to make it past the Andes at all so far? They have Paratroopers AND open borders with Mexico, surely they could sneak more than one or two units through Pariti.</p>"

New Holland’s forces look… even more split than last time, and seemingly hesitant to fully commit to securing the cities - that or the units keep getting bombed to hell by the Mexican air force. Either way, the bulk of the New Hollander military has high movement, and it’s flat land all the way to the reconquered border cities, so give it a turn or two and they’ll be back in blue - not to discount Mexico for trying, of course.</p>"

Waterloo and Agadir, meanwhile, are completely lost - no Roman units are left to contest them.

Being on par with Noongar in terms of land melee units is awkward, but they do have the advantage everywhere else, plus Anti-Aircraft Guns to compensate for Noongar’s own planes. Not sure why Palawa’s entire air force is off in the Pacific though. The Palawa should probably build more units soon both to fend off a potential Noongar attack and to occupy space that could be retaken by Wahgi peacekeepers at any moment, but hey, maybe they want the peacekeepers, I won’t judge.

This has allowed Mexico to attempt a cheeky flanking maneuver through the Citadel Road (or Citadel Bridge, I guess?), but two Landships won’t be able to take anything. To cope with their fate, the Osage have been pumping out Great Musicians, and they’ve even invited some Ikko-Ikki friends to hang out!

As for the other three cities, though… honestly, it feels like Mexico is running out of steam to flip the cities with. They’re either attempting one last charge toward the cities with their remaining units or forming a defensive wall among the mountains, but either way, the outnumbered but drastically stronger New Hollander forces should be able to win the day once again.

They’re seemingly very good at making use of these mobile units to contest cities and delay their invaders without needing to actually commit a major force to the front lines - they pulled the same trick in the south against New Holland not too long ago. Having air support probably helps, too. Unfortunately, the Yellowknives still have the city surrounded and are all but guaranteed to take it back next turn, so it was a bit of a fruitless endeavor, but I suppose in-universe every turn Mexico City isn’t attacked is another half a year its citizens can live in relative peace. There’s a pretty sizable Mexican force of Riflemen in the Yucatan Peninsula to the east, too, so maybe they can chip in or at least hold the line for a bit once the capital falls.</p>"

There is an almost-dead Finnish Rifleman that could flip Kirmukarmun one last time, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I think this is the end.</p><p></p><p>I’ll leave the proper eulogies for the Power Rankings, if only to save space, but I will give the Finns a little something here, too. That being said, there unfortunately isn’t a whole lot to say. The Finns opened up the game with a ballsy and completely unhelpful forward settle into the Scandinavian Peninsula (which they apparently did all the time in test games), managed to avoid losing the city to the Ume Sami in a war, but still got outsettled and completely encased between the Ume Sami and Latvia before they could become remotely threatening. Then they just sat there for hundreds upon hundreds of turns doing nothing, because there was nothing they COULD do and neither of the two civs that could put them out of their misery cared enough to do so, casually outliving much better and more interesting empires that actually put themselves out there and participated in the game. Finally, the Latvians ran out of other civs they wanted to invade more, and within 6 turns they wiped the Finns out. A pretty depressing run, especially for a game with so few boring civs, and not even the best “stand completely still” performance by a Finnish civ in the CBR. RIP to the Finns, may you have a more interesting game sometime in the future to redeem yourselves.</p>"

The Taino are looking like a classic example of a good-enough civ that would still probably get rolled over if a major power invaded, but at the very least Mexico probably doesn’t qualify as a major power anymore. Honestly, I have to wonder if the Taino could score a couple cities off Mexico if they invaded now, especially with their planes - Mexico’s navy is still mostly intact, but New Holland is working to correct that as we speak. If they don’t take anything (which they probably won’t), then depending on how thoroughly Mexico is torn up, the Taino could suddenly be even more out of luck than they were before - maybe the Yellowknives will leave Kanawagas or something for them. Given how empty New Holland’s Caribbean cities are, I’d wager they could honestly flip one or two of those if they really wanted to, but in the long term that’d probably be a horrible idea. Best to keep quiet and pick off the remains of Mexico if the big dogs leave any scraps behind.</p>"

Saba-D’mt has barely made any progress, but they have bombed Hajar into the red with a Destroyer right outside the city gates, so they may not need to go all-out to make gains.

Yes, the Seneca have become the second civ this season to adopt the Freedom ideology, putting them against the entire world (aside from the now-dead Mongolia, of course) in exchange for giving the viewers a bit of a giggle.

The Yellowknives are making good use of the Citadel Road to funnel in new troops, and Mexico is employing a Trireme on the front lines. I will also mention once again that the Taino could really benefit from declaring war on Mexico right now, given that nobody else is contesting Kaoto’ and the Caribbean was pretty wide open for invasion when we last saw it, but that would require the Taino to do something. (Actually, maybe they could even invade the Osage at this point? They have the tech advantage, and half of the Osage military is trapped behind the Yellowknives.)</p>"

Mexic does have a few naval units left, but even if they had a bunch of melee ships (they don’t), Quito is inland and would therefore require one of those embarked Riflemen or Landships to flip. I’d say it’s lost for good. As for the remaining Mexican cities, Latacunga still has a few units defending it, but it’s also evidently New Holland’s next target, and the defenders look positively screwed here. Riobamba, meanwhile, has no defenders, but also no invaders at the gates, so it might actually survive longer. New Holland could probably get this done even faster if they didn’t put their entire air force on Carriers in the Caribbean for some reason, but this strategy seems to be working for them so who am I to judge. It is pretty jarring to get the Yellowknives and New Holland in the same screenshot, though. </p>"

Initially expected to be an exciting and aggressive Arabian power, the Qarmatians initially did nothing but sit around and get outsettled like all the other Arabian civs.And then they woke up and chose violence, scoring massive upsets against not one but BOTH of their highly-ranked northern neighbors! It was crazy! The Qarmback was one of the highlights of the early game for a reason - it really provided some hope that these goobers just might manage to pull off some sort of a miracle run after all. Unfortunately… that was kind of it. Still trapped in their little desert peninsula, the Qarmatians did try to break out a couple times into the Indian Ocean, but it never really went well. They managed to fend off a couple of invasions, as well, but they really just ended up a very spiky minor power without anywhere to go, too well-armed to get picked off but too weak to actually go anywhere. It took all of their neighbors invading at once to break through their plot armor, and once that happened they folded like a house of cards, but at least it was way more entertaining than another 10 episodes of them just sitting around reminiscing on better days. Sorry about that, Qarmatians, but at least you probably cleared the very low bar of “second most entertaining Arabian Peninsula civ”. F.</p>"

It’s pretty tough, and serves as a very nice advantage over the other navies of the Pacific for the time being. (By the way - it is worth noting that the current Advanced Destroyer used to be called the Missile Destroyer in previous seasons.

The Ikko-Ikki do have quite a few Destroyers of their own, and they are contesting the invasion as best they can, but they are pretty severely outnumbered. Lucky for them, though, they do have geography on their side - Yamashina’s naval borders make an invasion from the east practically impossible, and it might distract enough of the Thule navy that the Ikko-Ikki can at least make an attempt at holding off X4’s Ice Sheet Fleet.

The last of the Roman African holdings are still fairly well-defended both by land and by sea, though, so I expect them to take some time if Sierra Leone keeps working at their current pace. In the west, however, things look a fair bit more dismal - Rome’s attempt to retake Waterloo and Aquilea has decisively failed, and while they have retaken Athens, it probably won’t last.

It’s kind of surreal to see that Kanawagas isn’t actually some isolated exclave completely cut off from the Yellowknife core, but the empires of North America have really done a number on the Osage over the years. It’s a rare and kind of beautiful form of bordergore to have this much Citadel spam, and the fact that it actually serves a practical purpose makes it even better, in my opinion.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Oh. Ohhhhhh. Oh shit. Okay, so it looks like the Wahgi aren’t exactly happy with Mexico’s survival. Or maybe they’ve just outlived their usefulness. Or perhaps they were just waiting for the Yellowknives and New Holland to back off, staking their claim early while pretending to be an ally. Whatever the case, the Wahgi have decided that no, Mexico does NOT get to survive their coalition war - with their units still absolutely blanketing Mexico’s remaining cities, they launch their own invasion of the Mexican remains. Honestly, this might be the single most brutal ar I’ve ever seen - it’s not impressive, it’s not all that thorough, but it’s so comically one-sided that it stands out regardless. Mexico is fucked in a way that no other civ has been before. Monterrey didn’t even get a turn to heal!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Sierra Leone becomes the latest of many civs to complete the Manhattan Project, and while I do have to question how Rome got it done before the civ that’s currently tearing them in half, at least they got it done at all. This also provides us with a nice shot of Sierra Leone’s core, and surprise, it’s practically empty. Honestly, though, I wouldn’t say Sierra Leone looks to be in any real danger right now. There’s no real problem with being under-carpeted as long as the units you do have are where they need to be (on the front lines), and you have enough defenses to stave off any surprise attacks. Sierra Leone hasn’t thrown their navy at Rome (not that they really could), and the bulk of the potential threats to their empire can only invade by sea, so keeping some ships around is probably at least good enough to buy them some time to rebuild their army if the worst happens. Obviously Paratroopers would be a bit of an issue, but there aren’t a ton of civs fielding large squadrons of Paratroopers, and those that do aren’t close enough to be a real threat. I guess the Faroes could be a problem, but if England is any indication, fighting a war alongside them should be enough to appease them for some time.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Goguryeo-Thule War has been starting off fairly slow, albeit decisively in favor of Goguryeo - Honsho-ji has fallen, and Ytyk’ is heavily damaged with multiple Goguryeo units at the gates. It’s looking rough for the Thule, and their navy is definitely thinning fast, but Goguryeo is also running into the exact problem I feared they would: difficulty maneuvering their units out of the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk. Unless they can maneuver the bulk of their fleet through two tiles really quickly, Honsho-ji is going to be one hell of a flipfest, and reaching Alaska might be a pipe dream. Maybe they should have waited for the Thule to take Yamashina (or at least secured Open Borders with the Ikko-Ikki) before declaring war. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Despite the hangups on the main Goguryeo-Thule front, however, Goguryeo does actually have some other angles of attack, thanks to their war with the Pueblo of all things. Both Kha’po Owingeh and the Hawaiian cities have fairly open access to the Pacific, and their ships are already heading north to beat back the Thule fleet that was on the verge of tearing the Ikko-Ikki apart. Honestly, I’m kind of amazed the Thule didn’t take a single Ikko-Ikki city down here, given how much of an advantage they had. It’s clear the Ikko-Ikki weren’t exactly lying down and letting the Thule take them, either, though - even now, the remains of the Ikko-Ikki navy are engaging the remains of the Thule navy just north of Shoman-ji!</p>"

    narration: "<p>Sierra Leone breaks new ground in the war against Rome by retaking not only Aquilea and Athens but Alexandria as well. They even have a lone ship harassing the Roman capital itself, but it’ll probably hold out for a few turns yet. Rome, for their part, isn’t giving up the fight, and has more units on their way to the central Mediterranean, but even the eastern portion of the empire is starting to look pretty exhausted. At this rate, Rome is going to end up looking more like the Byzantine Empire, except without any of Anatolia to put their capital in. It’d be fitting, at least.</p><p></p><p>With all that being said, though, I do want to commend Rome for actually holding up so well compared to the collapse of Mexico. Sure, Sierra Leone and the Faroes aren’t exactly the Yellowknives and New Holland, but seeing them put up this much of a fight really is inspiring. </p>"

    narration: "<p>To nobody’s surprise, Mexico’s Central American holdings utterly implode without the slightest effort from the Wahgi. You can barely even tell these were Mexican cities a turn ago, like a carcass picked clean by starving piranhas. Mexico isn’t dead yet, you can see the borders of Otavalo on the southern edge of the image, but there are also Wahgi units already circling in for the kill… the Wahgi are well and truly a player in the American theater now.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Not that the Wahgi needed to kill Mexico to get themselves a foothold in the Americas, mind you - the conquest of Bora-Bora is making that happen just fine on its own. We haven’t actually gotten a shot of Patagonia all episode, but by the looks of it the dam has finally burst down here. Four whole cities all fall to the Wahgi, seemingly at around the same time, and Caleufeu is certainly next. Bora-Bora has managed to retake Fa’anui, but with at least three Wahgi Paratroopers nearby, it won’t last long. Only Pampa Koani, still guarded by a New Hollander fleet, remains safe for the time being. I hate to say it, but Bora-Bora might not make it to the end of next episode.</p><p></p><p>They have made it to the end of this episode, though, because this is the final slide! Thank you very much for reading, I hope you enjoyed (or at least found a way to cope with the death and/or demolition of your favorite civs). I’ve been NopeCopter aka u/daXfactorz, and I’m looking forward to reading the next episode with you all, too.</p>"
