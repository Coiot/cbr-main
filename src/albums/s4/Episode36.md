    narration: "<p>The first few observers drowsily shuffle into the observation deck. It is early morning on the sub, or at least the  and only the earliest risers are watching the photo-realistic projections of scenes from the East African coast and corresponding graphs, maps, and news feeds. Pedro, once the winner of the Mk2 Battle Royale, now among the preeminent observers on the sub, lets out a sigh. “Regardless of Mogadishu’s advantages on land, they are fighting an uphill battle against an enemy with air power. I fear that the Second Qarnawu War will not go the same way as the first.”</p>"

    narration: "<p>A massive boom pierces the calm of the midatlantic night. Residents of newly occupied Chenussio stir briefly, but soon go back to bed. The near-constant testing of New Dutch weaponry has become a part of everyday life in the small coastal city. The New Holland central government has little concern for the territory they now occupy in North America, and has led little to no effort at reconstruction or winning hearts and minds; Intimidation suffices for such a powerless people in the crossroads of empire. The people, too, care little for the new Dutch. They are confident that, come next decade, there will be warships flying some other flag outside their ports.</p>"

    narration: "<p>In a sharp contrast to the jaded population of the American East, panic and terror reigns in the Deccan. Ever since the peace treaty with Singapore was signed, the residents of the ancient capital of Vijayanagara believed themselves safe, if subjugated. Decades ago, the Singaporean Armed Forces attacked with weapons far superior to the rifles and cavalry wielded by the City of Victory. Those weapons, at the very least, were comprehensible to the Vijayanagarans. Now, however, men rain from the sky, and massive explosives hit targets from seemingly nowhere. The citizens of the city cry out in fear, and in ignorance. To them, their whole world has caved in around them, their reality fundamentally shattered. To the Wahgi, its just another capital. Vijayanagara has been eliminated.</p>"

    narration: "<p>King Puni of Bora Bora breathes a small sigh of relief as he receives the news that Palawa agreed to a peace settlement. A few Antarctic settlements are a small price to pay when you’re currently hemorrhaging core territory. All is not well in Patagonia, however, as a Wahgi Submarine raiding group prowls the waters off of Cona Niyeu. This is indicative of Wahgi’s developing strategy for conquering South America. While taking over insular Bora-Bora was one thing, Boran South America will be a tougher nut to crack. Already, with the loss of the home isles, a massive cultural shift is underway in the territories still resisting the Wahgi invasion. </p>"

Observers on the sub crowd around the observation deck to get a closer look: The Yellowknives completed a new symbol of their ascendency in the North American continent, and its massive.

    narration: "<p>The Taino are an insular people, both figuratively and literally. Seldom having participated in the wars that have raged across the Atlantic in their long history, the Taino find security in their ability to be inoffensive. The cylinder, however, has changed in the previous few decades. No longer are small, but peaceable states being tolerated by the great powers. Small states that have survived for centuries, such as Vijayanagara, Makhnovia, and Siam, are now being conquered by their larger neighbors at an astounding rate. These conquests have been prosecuted with callous efficacy, no efforts by the victims have yet saved them. </p><p>The Taino seem themselves in these falling low tiers, and have embarked on an aggressive campaign of modernization and militarization. They have also begun to take a more active part in the affairs in their neighborhood, and have discretely begun sending aid to the beleaguered Bora-Borans. Whether it will deter the predators that circle them, and maintain the fragile balance of power remains to be seen.</p>"

    narration: "<p>“Damn, what was the name of that civ that used to live down here?” belts out an observer in the sub. Despite the peace with Palawa, the southern cone remains under fierce attack from a futuristic Wahgi Fleet. Wahgi’s vicious strategic bombing campaign has reduced the health of some of the former Tehuelche cities by half or more. Bora is outnumbered 2:1 in the air in this slide, despite Wahgi having no cities anywhere nearby. </p>"

The Sky Tower now looms over the historic core of the city, blasting the first ever national television broadcasts in North America. Undoubtedly, the tower will be primarily broadcasting nationalist, imperialist rhetoric across the continent. Mass media enables centralization.</p>"

In it, Paratroopers pour endlessly from the sky like ashes from a volcano, and helicopters, poorly understood by the Vijayanagarans, are led to eat and drink from the food stores of the former Vijayanagaran cavarly stables. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Last episode, Sierra Leone declared a war against Rome that quickly turned against them. That war was quickly called off by the Roman leadership, however, when the Faroe Islands declared war on Rome, fearing a shift in the balance of power between the two aspiring great powers. Now, the city of Nancy, formerly Burgundian, Then English, then Roman, has been quickly secured by the Faroese military. Trench lines and pillboxes set up on the Mediterranean coast prevent any hope for a Roman recapture. Rome has little to fear in terms of its core territory, but will likely struggle to wrest control of the strategic city of Narbo </p>"

    narration: "<p>Thule’s military is nothing to scoff at when considering them in the context of the whole cylinder. It is too bad that the only civs they need to compare against are Yellowknives and Goguryeo, both top-5 civs. What matters now is how Thule will get divided up between its neighboring super-states.</p>"

    narration: "<p>“The capital is indefensible.” calmly explains the general to Abu Bakr ibn Umar, the deathless Leader of Mogadishu. Ibn Umar just solemnly nods his head. He knows that the air power Saba Dmt’ possesses makes the pearl of the Indian Ocean, Mogadishu, vulnerable to attacks never before thought possible. The desert had always been their protector, their veil behind which they could cower. But times change, and the Second Qarnawu War will extract an even greater price than before.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Qarnawu remains under Mogadishawi control, but the capital has yet to be recaptured. Saba Dmt’s Artillery and airpower advantage is going to make maintaining a foothold on the African continent exceedingly difficult. Already there are ongoing talks in Afgoi, the interim capital of Mogadishu, of permanently relocating government and military organs to Madagascar, regardless of if they recapture the historic capital.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The Wahgi Armed forces were quick to establish a blockade of the Pacific Coast of Bora Bora. To the simultaneous relief and distress of Continental Borans, refugees from the war-torn islands of the homeland have stopped arriving. This does little to alleviate the anxiety of the constant sight of Wahgi Fleets off of the coast of cities like Ichabamba. Wahgi has yet to make a move on the continent, instead opting to launch probing attacks, looking for weak spots in the Boran coastal defenses.</p>"

    narration: "<p>A pair of Wahgi Helicopters scout the borderlands where Makhnovia, or more accurately just the city of Huliaipole, once existed. The Latvian State cited the rapid westward expansion of the Selkup Empire as a thinly veiled excuse for military occupation of the Makhnovian cities.

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode36-scene25.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Upon the declaration of war on two fronts, the Mexican central government organized mass volunteer corps (Gatling gun replacement that ignore ZOC) to fill the trenches. The artillery capabilities of the Mexican army of the time was limited, so the primary tactic used in the early days of the war was human waves. While nominally infantry were referred to as “Rifle Battalions,” in reality, the Mexican government was so short on ammunition that many soldiers fighting on the frontlines could not shoot, and could thus only attack using their bayonets.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The New Holland continental war machine rumbles to life for the first time since their wars against Tiwanaku. Mexico has allocated significant air power to fight New Holland. Many observers on the sub believe this is because Mexico wants to avoid a prolonged two-front war, and is attempting to coax New Holland, by far the weaker party of the Coalition, into an early peace. Whether or not this strategy succeeds remains to be seen…</p>"

    narration: "<p>Mexico’s northern front is another story. Intercepted communications from the Mexican High command indicate that they aim to take a purely defensive posture on this front. The Yellowknives Empire’s armed forces are both incredibly modern and numerous. Mexico will seek to lose as little as possible in the north, slowing down and delaying the fаr-superior Yellowknives military while they try and knock New Holland out of the war. Yellowknives are unlikely to use their already-sizable nuclear arsenal in this war, mostly because they are winning.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Rome, having mustered more advanced infantry units and a small flotilla of outdated ships, mounts a springtime counterattack against the Faroese occupation of their transalpine territory. On the sub, Pedro strokes his beard thoughtfully “Rome’s war with Sierra Leone has led them to significantly modernize their armed forces. Their infantry in particular is international-grade, but they still lag behind in key areas such as artillery and air defense.”</p>"

Their war against Bora has already proven successful in their conquests of Polynesia, but cracks have now appeared even in the continental Boran Fortress. Ichabamba, a strategic port on the Pacific coast, has come under a full-powered Wahgi invasion. A foothold here would make a perfect launching-off point for the invasion of the Southern cone.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Despite the Great Wahgi’s current focus on their invasion of Bora-Bora, they can still stick their fingers in other pies to suit their interests. Wahgi High Strategic command has long identified the burgeoning Yellowknives empire (among others, like the Faroe Islands, Goguryeo, New Holland, and the Selkups) as a potential long-term security risk. Thus, to prevent Mexico, a key player in the current strategic balance of the Americas, from being partitioned by two of those potential threats, Wahgi has deployed troops to the northern border with Yellowknives. These troops don’t fight, but have sufficiently spooked the Yellowknife invaders into significantly slowing their advance as to not harm the Wahgi military formations.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Goguryeo, similarly to Latvia, reacted with apprehension to the Selkup absorption of much of Kazan. After great debate in the halls of Gungnae, it was decided that the Mongols could no longer be counted on to keep the Selkup border safe, and that the Goguryeo state should directly absorb the Mongols for security reasons. Some objections were issued by proponents of the long-standing cultural ties between Goguryeo and Mongolia, but they were overpowered by the anxious-to-expand military elites in the end. Shortly after, it was announced to the world that Goguryeo would invade Mongolia, and souls all across the cylinder held their breath. “Would there be a Selkup response?” they wondered. Few wondered about the fate that would fall upon the Mongols.</p>"

Attempting to confuse and delay Goguryeo, Sorghaghtani, a mere figurehead in the democratic society of Mongolia, announced that Daji, the fox Empress of the Shang Empire, long having been incorporated into Goguryeo, was still alive. Daji had been kept in Mongol captivity for the previous century аs a potential last-ditch trump card. Now, she has been restored to her throne in Xiaotun, the only fromer shang city remaining in mongol possession. Since Immortals cannot break contracts with one another, and nobody had issued a formal declaration of war, the Army Groups of Gungnae could not enter Xiaotun. </p>"

With a modern population of around 40 million (equal to two Bavarias, or half a Rome) but a historically small population, the Qarmations have performed well in almost every war they’ve ever been in. However, that is misleading, as they haven’t been in a war in a very, very long time.

Since coming to their current technological advantage, the Wahgi have made significant progress in their achieving their goal of world domination. Siam, a moribund minor state, was turned into an outpost for the Wahgi on the Asian mainland. Vijayanagara too, joined the fold recently. The most important conquest of the Wahgi, however, was the dismantling on Bora Bora’s presence in the Pacific ocean. Wahgi now stands at the top of the world, and they have a realistic view of global domination. But not all is well in Mount Hagen. The spending on Wahgi’s ballooned to meet the needs of war with Bora Bora, and now the national deficit is exceedingly large. Economic crisis looms over the Wahgi state, as the government struggles to stop the prices of consumer goods from exploding beyond the point of no return. As the war with Bora stagnates, many on Mount Hagen worry that Wahgi’s position on top of the world is more tenuous than they previously believed. To assuage such worries, and heat up the domestic market, the Wahgi central government announced a nationwide holiday, celebrating their state’s entrance into the “Future Era.” A haughty declaration.</p>"
