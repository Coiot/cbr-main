  narration: "<p>Annnnnd welcome back to the Civ Battle Royale. I’m your host narrator for today, EmeraldRange, and we got some fun action to follow up on. You may know me from such bespoke top-tier contenders like Mog and Singapore.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We continue off after a weird plot twist at the race to 1st elimination last episode. Despite looking hopeless for the last 10 episodes, Shawnee somehow doubled in size- making many desperately delusional Shawnee fans believe they can stop the Seneca Sweep. The power rankers have certainly pushed Rio Grande back below Shawnee, but we know how wrong those guys are, amirite</p>"

  narration: "<p>The race to last place got another contender in the last episode with Rio Grande losing their capital to a Bora Bora snipe. This puts Bora Bora in the elusive two capital club, showing all the doubters that their Argentine colony isn’t just for show</p>"

  narration: "<p>Not the biggest change in rankings, but certainly up there is Maguindanao. The large deluge of war declarations last episode actually amounted to actual attacks- which has kind of spelt doom in Maguindanao’s horizon. We’ll see if that plays out.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sami Holy Hustle"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene06.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We start off with a look at Scandinavia where Ume Sami have been religionining and building a nice core. They only lost a few cities to the Faroes- a relatively good performance against the #1. Now, I wonder if that Holy Wars foreshadowing from the last episode will happen. </p><p></p><p>It’s a little tough for any Eastern Finn fans, but they have enough of an army to fight it out and not lose their capital</p>"
- scene_number: 07
  scene_title: "Idle Spearmen Saga"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene07.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We take a quick look at Africa where Ndongo looks like she’s about to lose that hard-won city of Malkerns back to Eswatini. That’s, of course, if those spearmen stop standing guard two tiles away and actually being able to take the city. </p><p></p><p>In the corner, we see some largely irrelevant wars declared on Harappa by Khoshuts and Siam who might collectively share one tile border with them.</p>"
- scene_number: 08
  scene_title: "Wahgi Armada in Action"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene08.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Next we see Wahgi’s historically accurate George Dewey attempting to attack the Philippine Islands with Zheng. The Admiral is a bit too far from the main armada, though- which seem to be taking Kuta Watu just fine. I’m sure Maguindanao having 75% of their cities under siege is going juuust fine for them. </p>"

  scene_title: "Arctic Settler Showdown"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene09.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Instead of fighting, Thule and Yellowknives seem to be doing a Settler race- while Thule got a city down, the Yellowknives have three… wait no four more on the way. </p>"
- scene_number: 10
  scene_title: "Shang Strength Show"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene10.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Don’t mind all the Americans declaring on Gugoryeo- the only relevant one in that list of new wars is Daji.</p><p></p><p>Shang has a lot of troops, all somewhat advanced and ready to take Yanshi back- probably. At least with the horsemen and the plains there’s a chance that she won’t just surround the cities with all those composite bowmen.</p>"
- scene_number: 11
  scene_title: "Bukharan Mountain Meatgrinder"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We return to the Partition of Bukhara. Last time, the Afsharids pulled it together in the second half of their war and took Samarkand. Massive blow to Bukhara, but at least Bukhara managed to end the war before losing their capital. Well, the Dzungars are hoping they can crack the Bukhara nut as well- but it’s gonna be a lot harder to get through those mountains. </p>"
- scene_number: 12
  scene_title: "Faroese Wonder Folly"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene12.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Oh hey, we’re just highlighting our reigning champs the Faroese. The analysts say that their production is lacking and we see right here they’ve been more focused on building fancy Incan cities in the cold desolate mountains of the North Sea instead of more troops so they can actually conquer Ume Sami next time. Is this a sign of things to change for them?</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Tiwanaku Wonder Not-as-much-a-folly?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Meanwhile, the actual Incans have been building Indonesian stone monuments. Maybe this is where the production that should've gone more towards the Tiwanaku Pampas campaign went. Maybe they could’ve actually taken the Rio Grande cities, but the Borobudur could help them if those foreshadowed Holy Wars ever become a thing. </p>"
- scene_number: 14
  scene_title: "Tangier Tug-of-War"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Sierra Leone takes Tangier! Though don’t get too excited that’s a large swarm of Composite Bowmen from the Alaouites. It will take just a few gaps in the Sierra Leonean naval defence for a trireme to slip through and retake Tangier. </p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Malkerns Standoff"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene15.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Well, as expected and predicted earlier, Malkerns remains untaken and the Swazi spearmen remain unmoved and still guarded up. Maybe this Swazi Ngweyama unique unit here can inspire the spearmen to move closer. </p><p></p><p>Although… those Rozvi troops are moving suspiciously closer to sniping it. Could it be? Is there still hope for them?</p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Cold Bering Blitz"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We move back towards the sleepy Thule as the Nivkh take advantage of the weak Ikko-Ikki cities in the Bering Sea. I’m not entirely sure that there’s enough triremes to take the pitifully weak city of Miyuki-27ka. If only some of the triremes and unique-archer-boats in the area could come focus down one city instead of splitting up.</p><p></p><p>Ikko-Ikki, for its part though, has their unique pikeman Sohei coming up the coast of Japan to reinforce or retake the cities. Thule, of course, has a settler ready to settle it if the cities get razed.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Stalled South Asian Standoff"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We take a look at the Vijay-Harappa war, which has mostly just resulted in some pillage tiles and dead soldiers. Oh well, maybe it will pick up steam later? </p><p></p><p>Vijayanagara suddenly realizes that there is an undefended Harappa forward settle in the Maldives and decides to get a Great Admiral- a Sri Lankan one. That local knowledge might be helpful but the lack of ships certainly won’t be.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Fish not Found"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene18.jpeg
  narration: "<p>SENECA SWEEP continues as Seneca takes all the cities in North America simultaneousl… wh… what? Damn, back to reality-land were Seneca is gonna lose their good river Ohio to the Faroes who are mostly assaulting them with work boats. Unfortunately, though those three full strength triremes and a horsey boy might be enough for the Vikings to re-find Newfoundland. We can only hope the Seneca land troops can take some of the overreaching Faroese cities by the Hudson bay. Their troop count would certainly suggest it but- you know how Prophetstown is still around? Yeah…</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Bering Mishap or Misfortune"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene19.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ikko clinches it out with a peace deal! They are gonna keep their sad 1 pop city and the Nivkh go home with nothing! I hope whatever they offered the Nivkh was worth that. Maybe Umu can se this sights on the even less defended and juicier looking Goguryeo cities right in the middle of his core.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Two Admirals and Three Blockades"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene20.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Kuta Watu drops even lower and the Wahgi now have a less historically accurate Great Admiral attacking the city. Hopefully that Zheng horseman doesn’t come in for the snipe but it looks set to fall. Sadly for Wahgi, the other Maguindanao cities aren’t really threatened- though they remain under siege.</p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Not very Sound Strategy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene21.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Faroese war continues with Ohio continuing to drop in health. The Seneca Sweep dream continues though with Sandur dropping in health. Of course, just ignore the large Taino navy near Chenussio- since they’d all have to go through the Long Island Sound and attack it one ship at a time. </p><p></p><p>Somewhat more interesting is that we can see Osage getting to Prophetstown in the corner. Though I wouldn’t be too excited since they have yet to do any damage to the city and the Shawnee still have enough troops to defend.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "No Elimination Yet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene22.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We can’t forget the relevance of the Antarctic! Rio Grande’s new capital in the Falklands is getting threatened by New Holland who aren’t satisfied with taking Caçapava do Sul. But if people remember the large navy that used to be here, it’s actually looking good for Rio Grande who aren’t set to be the first eliminated as they seem to have whittled the New Hollandaise navy down to two and a half ships.</p>"
- scene_number: 23
  scene_title: "Outback Reconquest Offensive"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene23.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We go down under and see the Palawa attack the Noongar. It’s a bold move for sure with the Noongar looking a bit stronger with generally up-to-date troops. Though maybe they think Noongar’s distracted by Maguindanao. The Palawa troops immediately go for Kriwa, and the flat desert of the Australian outback might be helpful to get those cities back in Palawa hand. We shall see, I guess</p>"
- scene_number: 24
  scene_title: "Surprise Shah"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Oh yeah, don’t forget we have Shah Jahan, famously a merchant and not an Emperor of India. Just because lazy Firaxis put him in Civ 6 does… oh he is a vanilla Great Merchant. Lovely. </p><p></p><p>Anyways, more relevant is showcasing that the Palawa also have a small lackluster navy and with a small miracle might take Pinjarra. At the very least they are blockading and reducing the growth of the Noongar capital.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Carrack Concerns"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Tiwanaku settles further into the South Pacific and continues to focus on non-military matters. Their army looks pretty thin for a top-tier power. Given what we saw from Bora-bora in South America proper, I would be worried that their large mass of Carracks would pose a danger to Tiwanaku’s newly settled islands.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "Pueblo Pacific Pioneering"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene26.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The big prize of unsettled Pacific Islands though is Hawaii where Pueblo continues to settle. Sadly unlike real life, the Big Island is the real prize and it remains unsettled. Though unlike the last round of CBRX, there’s not as much competition in this corner. There’s only really a small Ikko-Ikki settlement in the Sevii Islands in the corner of this slide and Pueblo has another settler on the way.</p>"
- scene_number: 27
  scene_title: "Sneaky Tie Ren Strike"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene27.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Anddd Kuta Watu falls! To a Zheng unique Pikeman snie! Of course Wahgi missed out on it again but they don’t seem phased as the ships start traveling south tot he main price of Simuay- which has already dropped to a 6-pop city. A sad day for Maguindanao fans.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "The Spear Struggle Ends"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene28.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Malkerns finally falls!! Sadly, no chance of a Rozvi war and snipe, but at least Eswatini finally realized that they can’t remotely take the city with guarded Spearmen. Ndongo has a bit of a chance to take it back, and it would be hilarious if their horseman recaptured the city only for Eswatini to go back to social distancing from the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Only in Ohio"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene29.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ohio falls as expected to the Faroes- who continue to do the bare minimum to earn their #1 ranking. They immediately set it on fire because they can’t handle how much sigma rizz was stuck in Ohio. Seneca is continuing to whittle down the other Faroese cities on the mainland- and luckily isn’t spending energy sending troops to retake the lost cause of Ohio</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Madagascan Admirals"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene30.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Hawaii of this CBRX seems to be Madagascar with a bunch of cities in the shot here. The thing that is being highlighted is the presence of Horatio Nelson. We’ll see if he does stop the unstoppable Mogadishu navy- if Mog ever wakes up/actually establishes a core. Luckily for anybody worried, eSwatini is doing the classic Great Admiral without a navy strat.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Perhaps an end to North American Fumbling"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene31.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We see a better shot of Sandur being damaged- which looks poised to eventually fall. The real funny here is Prophetstown continuing to be an inexplicable meatgrinder for Osage. With all those troops surrounding Prophetstown, you’d think the Shawnee are screwed but you know how things go in North America. They all really need to learn how to fight wars good.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "Mexico head on me"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene32.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Mexico decides that taking Kanawagas when no one else could is the peak of achievement and decides to sit around with their massive army. Instead they are now going to make luxury fashion and perfumes with their Versace Great Merchant capitalizing on branding with their latest line called “Kanawagas”. It’s only Kanawagas if it comes from the Golfo de Mexico, otherwise it's just sparking scented water</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Antilles Anchovies idk what to call this"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene33.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Here’s a quick shot of the Guyana area, which I must take y’all again for not voting into the CBRX. If it was in the CBRX it wouldn’t have been fully tested until like yesterday. </p><p></p><p>Anyways, we are mostly just looking at New Holland settling a city. Yay.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "Waterlogged Wat"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene34.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Faroes continue to build more wonders, this time getting Angkor Wat to claim even more water tiles. Well, maybe that’ll be useful if they survive until the Future Era. Yeah, I said it. We want blood and action not civs building wonders.</p>"
- scene_number: 35
  scene_title: "Alarming Archery Army"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene35.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Tangier holds! The Alaouites are at least doing somewhat good sending at least two melee units but they are probably blocking their own path to reconquest. The amount of composite bowmen surrounding the city honestly scares me a bit.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "Mamluk Missteps"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene36.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Mamluks continue to fail as Kanem-Bornu continues on their path to reverse their track record by taking Minya! Not only did the Mamluks fail to retake Mansoura last episode, they are now looking at losing two cities if their defence of Damanhur goes as the numbers here predict. Though, Kanem needs to be a bit worried given the large and everpresent threat of Saba-dmt in the corner.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "Hedges in the Arctic"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene37.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Not to be outdone by Versace, Nivkh answers with George Soros to do all their investments for them. Maybe he can give them enough money to lobbyist the Nivkh government to attack Bakjak without losing any cities to Goguryeon on the western side. If only there were wars.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Furthermore, Fumble Fest"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene38.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As expected, North Americans continue to fumble as Osage loses all the troops they had surrounding Prophetstown just a moment ago. Similarly, Shadur seems to be recovering since Seneca continues to fortify their front a good 6 feet away from the city so that they don’t catch the cooties- or take the city.</p><p></p><p>The CBRX broadcasters would like you to believe it’s because of Alaric, the new Shawnee great general who’s taking a vacation from the Visigoths. But that’s just what they want you to think to distract from how badly all the civs here do war.</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Pinjarra's Peril Perishes"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene39.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of war fronts that aren’t moving anywhere, the Palawa navy is almost gone with like 5 damage done to Pinjarra. At least there’s more of a chance overland? It’s not looking too good but maybe Marcus Crossus can transform Palawa into an Empire- wait he’s a merchant not a general so don’t hold your breath.</p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "Black Forest Battleground"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene40.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Another relevant war is declared, with just as promising of a war front as all the other relevant wars declared this episode. Bavarian troops march through the Black Forest to try and take Beaune from Burgundy. There’s a good chance that the 3 units stationed there can be cut off by the southern flank and the rest of the melee-heavy army can take Beaune. We will see, since I’m not feeling very optimistic about Bavaria’s competency.</p>"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: "Educational Break"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene41.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Afsharids consolidate their control over Samarkand and we see that the Dzungars did not pull off a miracle and are still grinding away at the mountains. Well I guess we have some filler content where we meet the American Educational Entertainment standards- </p><p></p><p>Afasharids have a new general, Casimir Pulaski. In real life he was a war hero who fought for independence and freedom in Poland and the United States, leading to many places in the US named after him. Repeat his last name afte me kids- Pu las sky! yay!</p>"
- scene_number: 42
  scene_title: "Western Southern African Woes"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene42.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Oh wait I completely missed this additional front in South Africa. The tension with the capture of Malkerns kind of distracted me, but eSwatini is now attacking on the west coast trying to take Kabasa from Ndongo. Luckily for any Ndongo fans, there is a grand total of four units left on the front on the Swazi side. </p><p></p><p>At least Malkerns is safe and secured, and hopes for a Rozvi miracle comeback continues.</p>"
- scene_number: 43
  scene_title: "Queensland Quarrel Quickens"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene43.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Looking at a few other fronts that we didn’t consider, there’s also this one in the Palawa-Noongar war all the way in northern Queensland. Again, there seems to be enough of a troop presence for Palawa to actually do something in this area and take the city. But there are enough Noongar reinforcements that can push the attacking army off if Palawa doesn’t move any other troops into the area. </p><p></p><p>In other news, we see three new settles in Melanesia with Tiwanaku bringing a settler all the way to the wrong side of Bora-Bora to maybe taunt them for Bora-Boran Argentina.</p>"
- scene_number: 44
  scene_title: "Trireme Temerity"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene44.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ikko-Ikki, satisfied with their defence in the Bering Strait, goes back to focusing on religion, reforming their religion and getting some bonus that we will see later. Again, potentially interesting when Holy Wars happen- if they happen.</p><p></p><p>We do see at least one trireme disagreeing with my prior assessment that the Americans’ mass war on Goguryeo was meaningless as a Pueblo trireme tries to take on the entirety of Goguryeo by itself. At least they might be good motivation for Shang to keep pushing on Yanshi in the corner</p>"
- scene_number: 45
  scene_title: "Religioning Intensifies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene45.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Ah yes, a whole slide dedicated to showing that Ikko-Ikki is doing religious things. At least you can look at the beautiful Unique Units there that didn’t get affected by the one model per unit mod for some reason. </p><p></p><p>St. Peter’s Basilica for those that don’t use all of Pooky’s mods gives Faith for every city based on Pietyu, so it’s a faith begets faith thing</p>"
- scene_number: 46
  scene_title: "Reformation Intensifies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene46.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Here we get to see what that reformation belief is- so that’s three slides on Ikko Ikki’s religion if anyone is counting. Better be some payoff with Holy Wars. Anyways, the new Reformation belief is actually somewhat important as it’s giving a bunch of Food as Swords into Plowshares. Much better than TXT_KEY_BELIEF_ALTARS of course.</p>"
- scene_number: 47
  scene_title: "Religious Spread Intensifies"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene47.jpeg
  narration: "<p>And here’s a map of the religions and where they’ve spread. Hey, maybe this is the Seneca Sweep we’ve all been promised.</p>"

  scene_title: "Admiral Oddities"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene48.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Singapore’s naval assault of an inland city fizzles out again. We can see in the corner that Maguindanao still has their capital. So all in all not much to see here. </p><p></p><p>We do get more Ottoman admirals- this time curtesy of Singapore. Maybe he can teach the Signaporeans the importance of amphibious landings, though Barbarossa was historically more into inland sea dominance- so if he’s historically accurate Singapore might take over the Gulf of Siam</p>"

  scene_title: "Arctic Horse Blockade"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene49.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Youch! Scary. A single lone horseman disembarks near Kyzylorda, single-handely blockading the Kazakh city. With Latvia and Afsharids attacking the Kazakh snake, the grand total of four border tiles might be at risk of changing hands.  </p>"

  scene_title: "Snow Shang Siege"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene50.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Well, that’s not the exciting Shang conquest that I was expecting to see, but I guess Daji fans should rejoice that a city was taken. Goguryeo loses their snowy city to Shang who takes it with a feisty small home-grown force from their even snowier city. Good thing there isn’t a giant force of Goguryeo troops who are now alerted to the issue.</p><p></p><p>Though Daji might get a break since the Selkups are too busy fishing to defend their snowy city and from the health bar, Goguryeo seems more concerned about taking Varsed than anything else.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Tiwanaku continues to try to become this season’s Kayapo as they sit around with their worker army and working towards non-military great people. At this rate Ecuador looks like they actually have more military units than Tiwanaku and that’s saying something. </p><p></p><p>The new Great Merchant is Zhang Qian and maybe, he can travel to the Middle East and bring back some military sense instead of Silk Road trade goods from the Afsharids.</p>"

While New Holland won’t give up on killing Rio Grande off cuz they just hate them so much, Bora-Bora signs a long overdue peace deal with them. Maybe this is a sign of them focusing on someone else- or just realizing they need to defend Piratini somehow.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We now head back to the arctic where the one city that Shang managed to take falls back to Goguryeo. Goguryeo has been a lot more focused on the Arctic where they also take out another Selkup city at the same time, regaining they Arctic ocean coast. </p><p></p><p>This would normally be where I comment that it doesn’t really help them to focus up here when they have a big war near their capital with Shang, buuttt Shang is just sitting around doing nothing so I guess good job?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode13-scene99.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Back in North Africa, Kanem Bornu launches another attack on Damanhur. This time there seems to be a much larger and sizeable army and the Manluk defence looks a little thinner than before. All this is good for KB, unless the ever-looming threat of saba eats that undefended flat terrain city of Minya. But it should be fine since Saba is still in that never-ending war with the Qarmatians.</p>"

  narration: "<p>That war I thought happened several turns ago actually happens! Mogadishu attacks Qarmatians and they start attacking Hajar. The Saba troops seem to have stopped the Qarmatian attack, but we will see if those five triremes are enough to take Hajar, especially with Safwan right there and easily distracting the Mogadishawi AI.</p><p></p><p>Also of note is the Afsharids coming south to forward settle Mogadishu or maybe add to the diverse cultural melting pot of Madagascar.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As predicted, the complicated asset transfer from Seneca to Osage is finally complete as the Osage takes Genundowa! It’s an act of charity before the inevitable Seneca Sweep happens. </p><p></p><p>The bigger nears on this slide is that Prophetstown is in the Red with a large large army of Osage units surrounding. Is this… our first elimination coming? Is North American FumbleCon finally coming to an end?</p>"

  narration: "<p>In an unexpected move, the Shang seem to be marching north to Yodong. The Goguryeo core is pretty empty of units so it’s not a worse chose than anything else, but maybe if they focused on Jolbon it would go better? There certainly are Gogurt units in Yodong so it won’t be an easy take. </p><p></p><p>In the southern front, the Shang have fully cleared out the Bohai Sea and are still surrounding Yanshi. Goguryeo’s chances of continuing to rely on distracted Shan archers are not going very well. </p>"

  narration: "<p>It seems like the Kalmyks declaring war and declaring the Kazakhs incompetent by proxy has triggered Nursultan to actually do something. While he’s still sending troops to sit around and die south of Herat, he is finally sending the bulk of his army to Elista, even going so far as to embark his own land troops into the Caspian- just to show Ayuka Khan he can be incompetent too! </p>"

  narration: "<p>We return to the Palawa-Noongar war where Ballardong gets a few new waves of attacks. Kriwa is as well as Palawa decides that if it failed last time, maybe he can do it again this time if he has 3 new island cities settled far away. </p><p></p><p>We will see if the troops can get to Ballardong since it looks like a much more land-based force and the navy being mostly embarked units. The good thing for Tarenorerer is that the Noongar units are no longer on their front- the Noongar army seems generally sparse.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We look at Ecuador again to look at their nice jungle horse army where they’ve decided that instead of attacking the Tiwanaku like I foreshadowed for the whole episode, they are going to instead be best of friends with Bora-Bora. Maybe they will attack together? Are DoFs really relevant? Are they common, but just unshown? So many questions arise.</p><p></p><p>Yeah, what that enough? The Ecuador sponsors paid for how many mentions? Uh wow aren’t they satisfied with the copious shoehorning in of Ecuador? Ecuador. Ecuador.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Faroes continue to come up with more non-military great people this time getting Dennis Ritchie. Wait, holy hell. Faroes were playing the big brain strategy of grinding out great people until they got someone who can hack the game. With the power of hacking into the DLL I think they are about to give themselves so many exploits. We are only saved by the layer of Lua stopping Dennis Ritchie from decimating the game itself.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well, F. Shawnee have finally been eliminated. The plot armour could only save them for so long. The highlights of their existence were when they founded a religion and also when they received that city from the Seneca last episode. They weren’t the favourites to win, but they definitely got the short-end of the stick when Seneca looked south instead of North and they got squished in. </p><p></p><p>That’s the first elimination after 12 episodes and a score of TWO original capitals for the Osage who now joins the illustrious club of more than one capital, together with civs like Bukhara.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Back in China, Yodong continues to get attacked, with the Shang attack going way better than any of their attacks on Yanshi. The problems there don’t stop as the Shang seem to lose some ground in Shandong. Perhaps this is because of Richard Howe, the newest Gogurt admiral who famously sieged Gibaltrar and might know a thing behind landing that Gogurt composite bowman right next to Yanshi. </p>"

  narration: "<p>In another front we haven’t seen in a bit, the Afsharids have actually gotten past Harappa’s Great Wall and moved a good amount of troops next to Dholavira. Even more impressively, their ships have recognized that you can’t actually attack cities who aren’t on the coast. They have brought Mehrgarh down to half-health with some more triremes in the back. However, Harappa has a good amount of ranged units around to take the triremes down and put up a good defence.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Visigoths regain their frontline positions pushing around the Pyrenees to try and take Asturica, and doing some damage. The Bavarians seem to have finally cleared out the Burgundian units near Beaune and the English are riding their ships down to Amiens. Three fronts and three threatened cities aren’t too good for Burgundy.</p><p></p><p>And this is the last part of this episode! Thank you all for having me. We will see next episode if Burgundy crumbles and if any of the other fronts ever move! Stay tuned, CBRX every Tuesday.</p>"
