    narration: "<p>Caitlyn (L): Welcome, welcome, welcome! The sun dawns on the cylinder for another round of bloodshed & conquest! Today I’ll be joining Paige in covering this release. Last time we wrote a narration, it was all the way back in May, so it’s nice to be writing again! If you all are not familiar with systems or plurality, feel free to do a quick google search, but TL;DR: Paige & I are in the same body, but are distinct people. If you want to learn more, join the Discord server, we’re active there & it’s also just a great place!Paige (P): We left off with Royal Hungary falling to Bavaria, & Burgundy & Pueblo being eliminated from the game by England & the Yellowknives respectively. Bora-Bora‘s raging across South America & greatly hindering the Tehuelche, & consolidating their gains. You gotta bora-believe. We also approach the Atomic Era, which I’m sure bodes well for the innocent civilians of the cylinder. Without further delay, let’s get into it!</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: Sonicfan0511’s map, as always, is very much appreciated, & from here we can review the changes from before. We can see how the wars in South America have reshaped the continent, where Bora-Bora has come to dominate the southern half, & a stalemate happens in the north. In North America, not much is happening, in contrast to Asia, where Siam has lost cities to Singapore, who lost cities before, Wahgi is becoming scary, while Zheng flakes out of a war with Ikko-Ikki. In Europe, the Faroes decide that England doesn’t deserve peace, & have set up an invasion force south, while at the same time, eSwatini is facing its demise in Africa. Oh also the Nivkh-Thule war. Hope you’re all caught up now.</p>"

While the Tehuelche aren’t in a position to take their cities back, survival is technically possible! Possible in the way that you can get out of bankruptcy by a lottery ticket, but still! I’d be shocked if María survives this episode. The Tehuelche settler on the Pacific side of the tip actually is positioned in a place that could prolong survival by a few turns, but a newly placed city will not be able to lead to their continuation.</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: The frozen sleeping giant awakens for its regularly scheduled snipes before returning to its nap. While these gains could end up long term, & that’s what I’m leaning towards being more likely right now, units are sparse on the frontlines. The Faroe Islands prefer naval snipes over large land based armies, which makes the gains harder to keep. With the bulk of England’s land forces stationed in the now conquered Burgundy, any English rebuke of Faroe gains remains dubious.</p>"

While they act more as a terrorist unit than a military regiment, messengers sneak through the desolate & mountainous Tibetan plateau between the unit & Qingliangang. They largely maintain themselves through imposing taxes on the few people living there, & raiding nearby trading posts, mines, & farms for food, killing all in their way.</p>"

    narration: "<p>L: Nader Shah, grew tired of the old cars of this modern era, & wanted something that went as fast as technology would allow. His staff, hearing about this, ignored his vain desires, & started their trek to Samarkand. Halfway through & crossing the Etrek River, their car began to stutter, & they had to pull over in the middle of a mid-sized town, halfway between Isfahan & Tehran. One of them asked a local about any car shops nearby, & recommended Ferrari’s shop. Hopeful, they walked across the arid countryside fed by aqueducts until they reached a dingy shop. Knocking at his door, an annoyed & unfriendly Enzo answered. Once the staff explained the situation, Enzo initially refused to help, even if they were the Shah’s staff, until they offered him a decent restitution for his labor. He chuckled, & offered for them to use one of his racing cars for the trip, which the staff excitedly agreed to. They let Enzo take their car as collateral until they returned. Upon returning, they offered Ferrari an audience with the Shah, which he agreed. Upon meeting in Mashhad, they quickly agreed to in exchange for a unique luxury car, the Shah would give him enough money for him to work on any project he desired. How could Enzo say no?</p>"

Progress in the war has been very slow, & seems neither party is fully committed to this war at this time. Regardless, I’m rooting for Vonya here, as this war will probably result in a stalemate, or mild Selkup gains like before.</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: Henry did not care, his empire had the reaper at the windowsill, tapping the glass, just as it was reaching its potential as a contender for world power. He desperately sent orders in a frenzy, unclear & panicked. His units so far between, with no communication, left major holes in their lines. Every unit took damage they couldn’t take, every unit lost men they couldn’t lose, every unit lived with death hanging over their head. At any time, some northerner could come in & bring them to an early demise.“Infantry [sic] are outside London, your highness.”Henry collapsed. If he couldn’t stay in this world, he’d go out screaming. During his mental breakdown, he sent multiple declarations of war out before his advisors were able to get him grounded. Henry decided that he could do no good at this time, & resolved to sleep before making more decisions. He would never be the same.</p>"

    narration: "<p>L: But I won’t feel blue. The Wahgi have one of the first units of the Atomic Era, which can pillage tiles or move 9 times in friendly territory without movement cost. They also are rapidly approaching the technologies needed for the Manhattan project, which should be fun to see how that goes. While they could build their core more, they need to expand more, especially with Noogar just to the south. Tech advantage alone does not win wars, but we’ll see how things develop.P: …WAH!</p>"

Now that peace has come, they need to focus on maintaining these successes. Singapore isn’t positioned well, but they certainly have a way to try & survive.

Still, we get a chance to look at the Kanem-Bornu core, which is shockingly sparse. It’s a lot of empty space, but they certainly need to produce more units if they want a chance. They still have crossbowmen in Agadir, Bornu, Minya, & Njimi for goodness sake! They are just simply in a bad position, & refuse to do anything to make things better.</p>"

Unfortunately, it’s over for the Tehuelche, there is no hope for them to maintain their position outside of a surprise white peace, which I doubt Bora-Bora will offer when they’ve not even taken the capital yet. Unfortunately, you will not beat an army of tanks & riflemen with musketmen, trebuchets, & crossbowmen. When this war ends, Bora Bora will certainly rise in power rankings, but they will need to make sure they can deal with New Holland & Ecuador before they can make their plans on world conquest.L: Also that’s a cute New Holland armada there :)</p>"

English marines & riflemen are crossing the English Channel & things are somewhat more optimistic for the English. The same fundamental issues that existed before still are there, but it’s now a race against time. In a prolonged war, the English navy will falter, & cut off any new units from the mainland. If Henry can retake Bristol & maintain the cities, he may be able to white peace. It’d be hard to compete again, but the English are not out yet!</p>"

Bavaria declares war on the English, giving the English a fight they didn’t need on top of another fight they didn’t need. A war on every single front barring the Visigoths. Wait, England declared war? Well, fuck me gently with a chainsaw!It looks like Saba(dabadooooo DMT) is hoping to snipe Malkerns before they lose all of their African territory, which is so based but they may or may not be able to quite yet, make in another turn or two. </p>"

    narration: "<p>P: If you are going to take a city, you need at least one melee unit on the front lines, not cannons in front of it. This isn’t the worst setup to clarify, but it also isn’t the best either. Ibarra looks set to flip, but maybe will flip back & forth a few times. New Holland is looking pretty good up north, while Ecuador’s interior is looking… dry I suppose.</p><p></p><p>L: About as dry as I like my wine really.</p><p></p><p>P: You don’t even drink wine Cait.</p><p></p><p>L: I can wine all I want.</p><p></p><p>P: Their army is still drier than this joke.</p>"

I’m somewhat skeptical of the optics in this conflict, & seems like a war that will exhaust Singapore’s resources even further. We’ll see how things go from here, I may be wrong.</p>"

As Rama is just putting the tiniest pieces of his country together, Güshi Khan swiftly moves into his western flank & seems poised to take at least two cities in the next two turns. We get to see the Khoshut’s unique unit, a lancer replacement that is effective at taking cities, & converts those cities to their religion. A very powerful unit in the correct circumstances, which this seems to be. Siam, if they don’t manage to maintain their country, is doomed, if Rama wasn’t already after Singapore came by.</p>"

Sure, the city could flip, & leave their former capital in even more ruins before being taken back the next turn.

    narration: "<p>P: A city that goes between being held by England & flipped by another civ? Where have I seen that before? If you’ve been paying attention to the minimap, you’ll have seen it has flipped back & forth a few times. Henry has now gone so far to arm settlers it seems, to refill the cities that are basically ruins now. His ships to the east have mostly sunk to the sea, with the possibility of rearming from the mainland about to be cut off, while also being invaded from the west from his own declaration of war. Lincoln is also looking bad, & he’s not going to get that city back if he loses it. If Henry wants to survive round 1 of the Faroes-English Wars, or to make things last, he needs to take his cities in Britain, & white peace. But I find this possibility increasingly unlikely with how much damage England has taken, but Henry is anything but dovish.</p>"

    narration: "<p>L: As I said, they had the ability to flip the city, which most cives would do in this situation, seeing as they will literally die without a city. It won’t last long unfortunately, as Bora-Bora has more forces in the South alone, & multiple ships crossing the Drake Passage to ensure that any survival is not long lived. It’s been a rough game for indigenous/first nation civs in South America, with both being wiped out in the same couple of episodes. Bora-Bora from here has become one of the three colossal players in South America, but will they be able to defend it against New Holland? Ecuador isn’t of much concern as you saw in the shots before, but New Holland is scary.</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: Here we have a good shot of what remains of Finland’s core: dense, but filled with outdated units that could be taken out extremely quickly. If Rijkuo-maja of the Ume-Sámi wants to get back into the game, they need to strike before Karlis Ulmanis of Latvia does. I find the latter more likely, unfortunately for us & our picks. The fact Finland has survived this long is a testament to the timidity of civs around them towards them, as Ume Sámi had two bad wars & never tried again, & Latvia has its own cycling that make it hard to predict.</p>"

With the units pouring in, it may turn into a Norwich flipping between civs that try to keep their gains. The Khoshuts certainly are focusing on Nakhon Ratchasima, which is a fair goal strategically, but it would have made more sense to move more units up north to be able to maintain their gains in the north at the same time. What are you going to do, it’s the AI & it has worse planning than a crackhead in Columbus.</p>"

I’m skeptical of how many moves they’ll take against the flip, as they have another civ barrelling through their northwest, &  they need as many units as they can get for that front. They might try to snipe Ratchasima as well, but that wouldn’t hold for long frankly. Siam is done soon,it’s just a matter of time until we see them die. </p>"

A few traditional songs were recorded, but they needed a way to promote the new audio format across the entire empire. William Baskinski, known locally for his avant-garde style of music & development of the experimental, ambient, & drone genres in the Wahgi empire, was selected to help promote the new style, where he would perform a concert live, & promote the product & machines to listen to the concert. So a gigantic concert was planned in Kuno, people flocked to the stadium from across the entire empire, & recorded the entire concert, being loaded into a cassette tape. After the performance was over, he announced the entire album was saved on these stips of tape. He chuckled, then threw it to the ground & stepped on it, exclaiming that this moment would be between them all forever. This was a stunt of course, while that decided to hold a copy of the concert, multiple were recording the entire time, & this stunt led to a huge demand for the ability to save magical moments forever.</p>"

María would not give up easily, but even as she stood tall, better guns will always win over honor. Eventually, the Bora-Bora had her surrounded, & without their leader, her remaining troops let the Bora-Bora capture the city in exchange for their lives, something the Bora-Bora would refuse to honor soon enough once María is given the wall. A strong fight & a strong woman, her efforts were ruined by her own reluctance early on, being unable to fill up the continent & prevent Bora-Bora from keeping a foothold.

He knew it was a matter of time until Lincoln fell, & all he could do was use it as a bargaining chip in his fruitless peace deals with the Faroes.

The Clash, a leading voice in the Lithuanian punk movement has released a song that despite the government’s official opinion of supporting the Faroe’s war, is vehemently against all war. Even if England is an imperialistic nation, the island is suffering a decimation unlike anything seen since northern Burgundy during the Anglo-Burgundian war. Their hit song, London Calling, puts the listener in the place of Henry V, & pushes for peace to be made in Britain. While unlikely to end easily, it sells well across the world, especially in Europe.  </p>"

    narration: "<p>L: Mark E Smith, while at a gig in Lithuania, was able to help create a post punk band under the name of “Falling Down”. An aggressive punk band with influence from across the world came striking through the Dzungar music world, with a consistent barrage of albums & music building up notoriety the world around.P: The Dzungars actually have a pretty decent core, but I’m not envious of their position in the cylinder.</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: Saba’s assault is slow, but definitely making progress. It may flip back & forth a few times, but I don’t think Pontus will keep the city at the conclusion of this war. While there’s a chance of this, we’ll see what happens, I remain a Saba stan until the last drop of peasant blood.</p><p></p><p>L: Paradox games are my thing tho Paige!</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: We also get to see the Taíno unique unit here, which has been mentioned enough times already, so I’d rather talk about the core. It’s looking alright, but not as ahead as it could be. It’s definitely nice to see them finding more tech & building up across the Caribbean. Agüeybaná II likely doesn’t have a chance to win, but they may not be overrun immediately this season, which is always nice to see a civ able to put up a fight.</p>"

Winning awards & accolades for her contributions to the nation. No less than 24 studio albums, she is an unforgettable presence in their history.P: Holy shit that carpet, that’s a very nice carpet. It’s hard to overestimate how much the Zheng can help those fucking around to find out. The land is definitely not as clearcut, but </p>"

    narration: "<p>Turn 389</p><p>P: We have some Wahgi peacekeepers holding the line between Palawa & Noogar. In such a tense continent, a peacekeeping force honestly may  be the deciding factor between the two Australian powers. Even so, there are routes that could lead to some advances, including in the south near Pataway. Hold on, I’m being informed that Noogar is planning an attack against Palawa! Well this is quite interesting. Against the Palawa alone, it’d be an easy victory for securing the entire continent, but with the Wahgi peacekeeping alone, it’s not going to be easy, especially if he decides now is a good chance for a surprise attack from the north. </p><p></p><p>Sidenote, only Tarenorerer is included in the info sheet, not the full name. Weird thing that is.</p>"

    narration: "<p>P: Henry sits with a few of his advisors outside of London. The island is lost, & they all know that. The artillery are coming, the ships are coming, & now the only decision left is to either die with honor, or flee to win another day. Another advisor chimes in that they have little time to make this choice, heck the channel is already filled with Faroe ships, so any escape is risky. Bavaria hasn’t taken Dijon, but it seems to be just a delayed death. So, Henry stands up, nods, & sets off to his room. His advisors head off, & the generals are notified of his decision.</p>"

    narration: "<p>L: The nation is gone, all that is left are a few scattered units contacted through telephone lines & maybe a few ships across the world. eSwatini now is a government in exile, attempting to run in this exile, but to no real recognition. Mdluli now lives in darkness, & his people abandoned by a man who they promised their loyalty to. Now, Mogadishu, Ndongo, Saba, & Palawa hold the tiny scraps left, to govern a people abandoned. Also, nice swipe Palawa, that’s what we like to see here!</p>"

    narration: "<p>L: The Leovigild government’s legitimacy has collapsed, & a variety of different partisan units have taken up charge of the military. While less than perfect, there’s largely no hope for the state’s survival, so a loose confederation of various nationalistic extremist movements will be the Visigoths’ final days. Yet, Sierra-Leone marches onto Narbo. If they maintain their momentum, they’ll be set for the next phase of the battle royale. </p>"

    narration: "<p>P: Kalibangan flips to Singapore, as their strategy works about as well as they can wish. Singapore is a civ that can lose cities & gain cities in the same episode, & seemingly fall down & up at the same time. The assault on Rakhigarhi has begun, leading to it falling to yellow. While it may flip a few times, I don’t see it being likely that Vijayanagara will be able to hold the city without reinforcements, which from there, Mangalapura is only a small hop away. Things are looking good for Singapore.</p>"

Taking Tiwanaku seems like the next obvious choice, or leading into Ecuador, take your pick! Either way, Bora-Bora stocks are going to rise.</p>"

The Wahgi next turn likely will take the third capital, which Rama V continues to indulge in his vices in spite of the world, & there is no coming back. I can only imagine the shame & weight that Rama must have now.</p><p></p><p>P: Thank you all for your patience this episode, we wanted to make this the best we could in the circumstances given to us, & we appreciate being given the chance to narrate for you all. Feel free to share your thoughts, we’d love to hear. There can only be one winner of CBRX. There is no room for seconds, & the onslaught of death must be ruthless & heartless. As this episode has come & gone, we see different Civs fighting over the same land in the hope of ending the eternal cycle of violence, with their vision & culture dominating of course. Tune in next time, to see how things go.</p>"
