And of course, things could get even worse should the Dzungars or Goguryeo get involved.</p><p></p><p>It's also an important episode for Daji as she hopes after the humbling she received not too long ago that expanding into Mongolia could start a new age of prosperity for her dynasty.

Henry walked up the advisor, unsheathed his sword and pointed it straight at the man's jugular. “Have you gotten who I am? I am Henry the fucking fifth! I take on any battle no matter the numbers game, and you shall all be wise to never oppose my will! Now, spread the word, and never speak at me again!” The agitated monarch gestured to his own throat with the index finger of his spare hand. “... Or else!”</p><p></p><p>Without another second's pause, the knights in attendance immediately departed to spread the news. And so it came to pass that England was at war with Burgundy again.</p>"
