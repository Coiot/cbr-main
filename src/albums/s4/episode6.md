  narration: "<p>Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome, im CBR, au CBR, to CBR! It’s time for another journey to the Cylinder to check in on our favourite goofballs and their horrifying cycle of bloodsport and murder. When we left off last week, conflict had erupted in Australia, the Oirats were infighting, and South America was boring (I know, I know, tell us something we don’t know).This is LacsiraxAriscal, aka Lacs, aka your showrunner and former chief power ranker, narrating this episode while simultaneously watching the CBR tick by in real time. We’re almost up to t800, so as ever it’ll be a bit of a headfuck to teleport a few millennia back in time. But before we get to the action, it’s time to check in with all our regular weekly shenanigans.</p>"

In tests Akaitcho was very timid and hesitant to settle, so honestly I’m just happy that he’s been expanding a little more freely this time, even if that’s come at the cost of, uh, any military at all.</p>"

But honestly, in all the time I’ve run CBR, I’ve never received a coffee or coffee allowance from Coiot, so I think it’s all a scam. Granted, the proceeds from the Ko-fi did pay for the PC on which I run the CBR, as well as an expansion pack I apparently did not have installed which this season wouldn’t run without, but c’mon, where’s my chai latte huh?</p>"

  narration: "<p>A big winner in this week’s PRs, the Noongar not only reach the top 20 but also leapfrog the Palawa, beating them by just a single rank. They certainly took the initiative in the first war to break out in the great southern land, but a war is far more than a single battle, and the next episode should be a big test for the traditional west coast underdogs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin our regular proceedings with a look at a breakout star of episode 5, the long-suffering Qarmatians. We had a tough, tough time getting al-Jannabi’s infamous brigands anything close to their IRL counterparts, with their flat desert start kneecapping their early growth and expansiveness. Fortunately we found an answer: coral! One of the custom resources in CBR, we slightly altered it to give a production bonus, which gave them a couple decent coast tiles to work early, and it helped a bunch. Plus it’s not even inaccurate to real world geography, so that’s a bonus!</p><p></p><p>Bandar-e-Bushehr is safely Qarmatian now, but Shiraz is still firmly on the front lines, with Afsharid units prowling close by.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A Mongolian army is steadily making its way through the hinterlands of Selkup territory, close enough to their cities to make Vonya weary though not so close that he’s firing warning shots. There’s nothing to fear from an army of that size, frankly; more worrying is the Dzungar settler about to snap up some prime real estate just over the Altay mountains from Narym. Still you’d be hard pressed to say the Selkups haven’t come flying out of the gate, as they rapidly approach a double digit city count.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Dai Viet have a very pleasingly shaped empire, tracing IRL Vietnam’s spindly coastline with a somewhat oversized ‘head’ stretching into Laos and Yunnan. That’s great, because it doesn’t look like they’ll be settling much more - they’re becoming remarkably boxed in. They have a settler over on Luzon, but they’re surely too late - there are no available city spots on the northern half of the island, and SIam look sure to eat up the southern half soon. Zheng fight off a pithy Goguryeo naval assault.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The fight for the Outback rages on as the Palawa begin a renewed offensive, in prime position to retake Maytim while a sizeable fleet blockades the port of Pinjarra. But the Noongar still have the definite advantage on land, fielding a good number of their unique spearmen (which don’t function all that different to regular spearmen, just free pillaging and cloning any captured civilians). They should be able to ensure both front line cities will eventually be settled in their favour, the real test being if they can progress the war to Kriwa.</p>"

Güshi, why?I mean, uhhh, the benevolent holy leader of the Khoshut people make another generous offering to their Oirat brothers-in-arms, with Gyangtse only a warm-up gift for their true sacrifice, the grand city of Lhasa, right in the heart of Khoshut territory. Usually when a civ gives away a random core city in a peace treaty, it just becomes a casus belli for a future reconquista, but the terrain in Tibet is so unforgiving they might be hard pressed to easily liberate the city the next time these two go to war.</p><p></p><p>The Harappa army is looking strong.

Instead they watch on as the Osage continue to fight off threats from east and west, as the Pueblo hold fire while the Seneca engage in Kentucky.

They elect to expand their pagoda complexes to include vast basilicas, making a tidy profit from tithes in the process, while also establishing sacred orders in order to better recruit proselytizers to the faith. Not the flashiest beliefs, and it’s still a very culture-focussed religion, but with Shawnee Lutheranism right on their doorstep this should help them establish Gaihwiio as a dominant faith in its own right.</p>"

  narration: "<p>After an uncharacteristically feeble start, Nestor Makhno is finally coming into his own, besieging his former Black Sea jewel Ekaterinoslav and close to capturing the Latvian outpost of Rezekne. It’s worth saying though that should these battles go smoothly, it would give Makhnovia just five cities - much less than most civs have through settling, at this stage. There’s clearly still a lot of ground to make up here. Elsewhere Pontic troops swarm through the Caucasus without making so much as a dent on Lagan’s defences. Does Lagan not sound Irish to anyone else?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ndongo-Matamba are currently at war with just about every one of their neighbours, excepting the one with only two cities. This is proving to be far less of a problem than you might expect. None of their cities have taken a lick of damage yet, with Eswatini unable to get close to Kabasa, Kanem-Bornu’s horsemen being kept away from Kindonga by an Afsharid scout, and Saba-D’mt just… uhh, maybe the DMT is getting to them. The only actual threat is to their newest city, Cambambe, which is unprotected and facing a real test from Mogadishu’s unlikely land army. They should feasibly be able to rebound and take the city back if worst comes to worst, especially as the only civ on the block with composite bowmen.</p>"

With another bleak desert start, Mogadishu were also a civ I worried about in testing, so I’m glad to see a strong start from them this time round.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As I’ve said many times before, if Coiot let me have my way, I’d manually rename every city on the Cylinder to accurately reflect their irl counterparts. Shaybani evidently agrees with me, settling Balkh on what I’d call the perfectly accurate tile. A sexy move, but maybe not a particularly strategic one, as they are still at war with Harappa, who loom menacingly close by. On the Kazan front, Elista is safe and secure, though further progress seems unlikely at this point. Dang, it’s been a good few turns for desert start civs. Warms my heart it does.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I feel Gwanggaeto’s thunder has been somewhat stolen by the more glamorous Shang just to the south, but he’s building a steadily more and more impressive empire in the Amur basin, joining the ten city club with the foundation of Yodong. They’ve also built a few of their unique horseman replacements, the Gaemamusa, which enjoys rough terrain like the forests of the Gogurt north. I do think the icon looks a bit like a rhino, but as far as I’m aware they do ride horses. Mongolia also have a new city up, Tiflis, on the shores of Lake Baikal.</p>"

Though, er, not to burst the hype bubble but Wahgi will assuredly flip the city back if so. Kudarat just doesn’t quite have the firepower to win a prolonged flipfest, so Kuno will likely be the only spoils he takes from the war. Bol’im’s revenge might come through sneakier methods, as a Wahgi settler makes its way up the Philippine coast.</p>"

Their second city of Klaksvík has a higher population than most capitals! That surplus of people is being put to good use, most of them being pressganged into the navy, it seems. That’s a much bigger fleet than we’ve seen from any other civ so far, even the other early Sailing civs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kudarat captures Korn! But with four spearmen in tow, the Wahgi will easily take the city back next turn, and only a tremendously timed peace treaty would see Maguindanao keep the city at this point. Maguindanao’s reserve fleet consists of a single trireme. This area of the world is also pretty high population - Wahgi’s Banz actually outlcasses the capital of Mount Hagen, while Mag’s cities of Simuay and Lamitan are also pretty little metropolises.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And as the last screenshot teased, the city of Ekaterinoslav has finally been liberated by Makhnovian forces (please ignore that it was Makhno who gave the city away in the first place). Rezekne should be next, though Makhno should beware the Latvian forces mustering around Liepaja, as his empire’s western flanks look a little vulnerable. Latvia meanwhile have already replaced the lost city, founding Jurmala at the foot of the Gulf of Finland. Pontic Scythed Chariots continue to raid the Abkhazian highlands.</p>"

Should be a decent little wonder for Mongolia, anyway - we often see our central Asian civs be low food powerhouses, which usually leads to an insurmountable tech gap by the late game.

  narration: "<p>Gao Xiang, former midfielder for Qingdao Huanghai, might seem like an odd pick for a Great General, and that’s because the name actually refers to a Three Kingdoms-era general of Shu Han. He’s been tasked by Nzinga with the defence of Kindonga, and he’s likely finding it a breeze, with Kanem-Bornu having only fielded a small force of horsemen, famously not great at taking cities. Of more interest is Cambambe, which has steadfastly shrugged off the assault of Mogadishu. Ndongo are looking very secure for a civ embroiled by war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>There are an awful lot of Chinese generals, and this one’s stayed a little closer to home. Princess Pingyang, in our timeline a distinguished general who helped found the Tang Dynasty, is tasked with pacifying Anyang; it’s got a bad case of, errr, having its citizens murdered by a vicious vulpine empress. It feels like every time we Shang, they’ve added another city to their empire, with Xiaotun in the far north being the newest addition. But there is trouble afoot, as Zheng soldiers cross the Yangtze and penetrate far into the woods around Machang. It’s a little too disorganized to constitute an attack, but it’s a warning.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Gotta admit, I was skeptical when I first Bora-Bora sending settlers to Patagonia, but they’ve got a very healthy army garrisoned in their two cities now. They could do with more spearmen to match the Big River horsemen, mind you. With that said, their war seems like a bloody stalemate at the moment. I’m disappointed in Rio Grande - they were very expansive in most of the tests we ran, but they’ve been completely out-settled by Tiwanaku and New Holland this time around. The Tehuelche being disappointing is a little more predictable, but they do at least have another settler out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Yagan means business. The Palawa counteroffensive on Maytim is brushed away, and Noongar forces now close in on Kriwa. Exposed in open terrain as it is, there is more than a good chance it’ll be flying the orange and grey before the episode’s over. But this offensive has come with a risk; much of the land army defending Pinjarra has been remobilized, leaving the port very vulnerable to Palawa’s naval assault, with no melee units close by to flip the city back if needs be. I think it’s worth the gambit though - it wouldn’t be hard to redirect the army back to Pinjarra after taking Kriwa, and an already damaged city wouldn’t be a difficult capture.</p>"

Po’pay’s Pueblo are still at war with the Osage, though but for a small skirmish outside Ni-o-sho-de, you’d be hard pressed to tell. Despite early successes there, they’ve backed off from Mo-he-ag-gra. Their unique bowman, the Lada:kwe, is up and running. Its most pertinent bonus is a bonus against wounded units. There’s often a lot of those about in a CBR, you know?</p>"

  narration: "<p>As was inevitable, Korn falls back to the Wahgi. Maggie could certainly flip the city back, though I do think it will likely end the war in the beautiful plum shades of Wahgi. Mag and Wag are both civs that tested very well, which made me a bit nervous to be honest - we just had a winner from this area, could another one be anywhere near as special, would it cheapen TL’s achievements? Though it looks like they’re both tiring each other out this time around.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Latvia improbably keep hold of Rezekne a little longer, but it’s surely only a matter of moments now. They’re already preparing to replace the city, mind you, with settlers scouting out the northern reaches of Russia. They might have to watch for the Finns, who have their powerful bowman UU online, the Kalulainen Huntress. When these gals damage great people or naval units, it damages every other enemy unit of the same type. Nasty, they could tear apart a whole navy with just a couple units. Not to mention that when stationed on coastal hills, they get two attacks!</p>"

They could do with blitzing those English cities in Normandy before the English navy is powerful enough to turn that campaign into a flipfest - at the moment, England can only spare a couple of triremes to raid the northern Visigothic coast. Burgundy have finally built a coastal city, mind you, with Amiens, though I still wouldn’t fancy their chances on the high seas.</p>"

Trajan has a very, very low bar to clear to become the best ever Roman Empire the CBR has ever seen, and I still don’t feel confident saying he’ll manage it. The Singulares, their horseman UU, have a neat teleporting ability that I’m not convinced the AI will know how to use, and its other bonuses all pertain to barbarian encampments, so that’s a shame.

Inevitably-top 10 Kazakhstan (recently voted the most disliked civ of the season, for some reason) strike a blow on Bukhara, descending their huge army of spearmen directly onto a virtually defenceless Herat. This could end incredibly sourly for Shaybani, whose remaining army is spread very thinly across his emirate. If that Afsharid Empire hanging around the Caspian were to join in, this would be a bloodbath. As it is, the invasion is survivable, though probably not without concessions.</p>"

The terrain here is rough enough that I think they could reasonably hold onto them for a while. Blue is blue, I suppose. Mongolia’s army seems incredibly understaffed, but to be honest, no one nearby looks like a threat at the moment. European civs must be looking on in deep envy at this blissful safety.</p>"

Not that his talents as a flying ace are likely to be of much use in an era before gunpowder. Shang may be big - and goddamn, are they big - but they’ve really only concentrated an army in their core, and any sudden movements from the Mongolian nations to their west would be a little frightening.

The city’s very exposed to a naval attack, which Siam currently are completely ill-prepared to ward off, so I doubt it will remain in Rama’s hands for long. In fact, there’s an awfully auspicious Singaporean fleet sailing up the coast of Cochinchina as we speak… they’re not currently at war with anyone, so keep an eye on those guys.</p>"

To the north, damage numbers remind us that the Crow and Yellowknives are still at war - it can’t be all that interesting, given I apparently didn’t take any screenshots of it.

Still, look at Tarenorerer’s land forces - I count four archers and a spearman on the mainland.

Instead Dai Viet are the targets, whose nearest city Bac Giang is just inland enough that Singapore’s largely naval-based forces won’t trouble it.

The Palawa army is so depleted that once Pinjarra is retaken, Nipaluna seems like a very credible new target.
