In the meantime, Victoriacum is under immediate danger, while the SL troops near Waterlook are likely to be distracted and confused by the duality of targets now available. Progress against Alaouites is slow as-is, thanks to the rough terrain, and this won’t help - but maybe SL can get some spoils of war out of Visigoths instead!

Those guys deserve an award, seriously. Only Ikko-Ikki and Dai Viet remain, and Ikko’s navy is famously busy exploring the Pacific. And even if it wasn’t, Zheng’s navy is most certainly bigger, even through getting attrition’d against Wahgi. In fact, a sizable Zheng fleet showed up to defend Chaozhou & Siming - this might’ve influenced the Goguryeo willingness to make peace, but now that Goguryeo is out of the way, this fleet could be used offensively against Ikko! What a turnaround that would be - and completely within Zheng’s character!</p>"

    narration: "<p>We see the Puebloan-Mexican front for the first time in ages, and as one could judge based on the lack of attention given to the front, very little has happened. We can assume that thousands of able-bodied men have fought and died, but that’s about it. Walatowa is secure in Mexican hands, and progress in either direction looks nigh-impossible. This sense of futility is further driven in by the recent Goguryeo-Pueblo peace deal. The full force of Pueblo bears down on Mexico…and Mexico holds just fine. Gone are the days of Pueblo being perceived as invincible. </p><p></p><p>Maurice Denis was a French painter, decorative artist, and writer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Only the mountain fortress of Ganeriwala remains in the north, and that too is almost certainly going to end up in Khoshut hands, meaning Khoshuts will be getting every city that Harappa started this coalition war with! And let’s not forget about the Great Wall which is now in Khoshuts’ possession, a powerful defensive wonder for another era or two. A remarkable feat no doubt, but moreover a tragic turn of event for Vijayanagara and the Afsharids, who both really needed a break. But hey, maybe this is Khoshuts’ way of apologizing to us for playing a really lackluster game so far. Because this is genuinely fairly impressive showing from them. </p>"

With composite bowmen and no siege weaponry, taking a 48 strength city will be difficult, to say the very least, but it’s the principle of the matter. By all means, Saba is the stronger civ. Saba has better stats, and is fielding crossbows, muskets, and CANNONS against Kanem’s MEDIEVAL army. So how can this be? How long can it go on? How long will Saba let it go on? I guess the truth of the matter really is that Kanem simply wants it more.</p>"

Too long has Australia remained divided, too many times has Noongar humiliated Palawa - no more! The Palawan military has largely become gunpowder-based, a distinct advantage over the Noongar land forces still utilizing swords, crossbows, and knights. Palawan cannons are noteworthy in particular, an example of Enlightenment Era tech. Interestingly, it is at sea that Palawa finds themselves outmatched, as they do not have Navigation yet. Fortunately, the ENTIRE Noongar navy is busy sieging Java. </p><p></p><p>The Noongar Great General, Saito Dosan, is one of the first to hear about the declaration of war. He must utilize shrewd strategy to defeat the gunpowder armies of Palawa. In our timeline, he was a Japanese samurai during the Sengoku period.
