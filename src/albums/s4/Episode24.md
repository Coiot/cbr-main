    narration: "<p>Ohayou to you all (it’s morning when I’m writing this so I can say that), it’s me again, Orange/Orangechrisy here with another episode so soon. You can’t keep me away too long >:3 I may even be back a third time depending on how things go…</p><p></p><p>Anyways, wow! Since last time I’ve finally graduated and have been lazy about things which means I’ve had a lot more time on my hands, which is how I’ve somehow completed two mods since then (Shasta and Northern Paiute), so much shorter than I’ve done before. And along with that a whole bunch of maps for people. But more than that, I just recently finally got around to redesigning and working on a mod that I’ve had in the works for nearly 5 years. And I would’ve started this narration yesterday when I got the slides but I was busy trying to focus on doing a map for them, and now I really only have a couple more bits left until that’s all done. So I’ve kind of set a goal for myself to finish that mod before this episode comes out, it’s currently Sunday morning so I have today, tomorrow, and half of Tuesday to do narration and finish that. So I guess you’ll find out afterwards if I succeeded or not… </p><p></p><p>With that all said, let’s get into the episode, it’s a real bloody one filled with wars and deceit and some very risque moments. Maybe. I dunno I haven’t read the episode yet. So I guess we’ll find out together, time to begin…</p>"

Anyways as I said it’s currently Sunday morning and I don’t do the comic until Monday evening or Tuesday morning so uh, no idea what this is on. Noongar attacking Singapore? Palawa trying yet again to attack Noongar? Ikko Ikki facing the consequences of their actions (not building boats)? Find out- well I guess you’ll already know won’t you. I’m the one left in the dark here. You tell me what my comic is about bitch!</p>"

    narration: "<p>I want to show off the Noongar here, because they are at the center of a very big war, and somehow they’ve climbed four places because of it! They’re on the offensive against a Singapore who is struggling to return their fleet to defend, and on the defensive against a Palawa who is, uh, oh geez, twice their size militarily and 6 techs ahead… Hmm. Maybe we PRs were a bit too optimistic. BUT, it has to be noted that Noongar have been very good at clutching out wins against Palawa. Or maybe Palawa just sucks at war. Either way, I’m rooting for them, go Noongar! Burn ‘em all!</p>"

The Harappan units are either all dead or scattered into the far off corners of the world. A tear shed for those lost.</p><p></p><p>Now I have it on good authority from the gamerunner herself that she restarted until she got a run where Harappa wins. So I’m sure they will get liberated and then pull off the most insane comeback ever sometime soon. Like, no doubt about it. But until then, Khoshuts got a new core.</p>"

One tile to attack the city, forests to block the cannons, and a giant -28% attack penalty from unhappiness because there hasn’t been a smile on a Faroese face since turn 230.

Their lands are being taken very brazenly. Ndongo has the tech advantage and eSwatini is running out of coast to defend themselves on.</p><p></p><p>Highlighted is the Mog UU the Uwassiye, which replaces the Caravel and has +5 strength (and people got on me for Malacca’s Jongs…), along with providing +2 gold for each active trade route to the city its stationed next to. In addition it +1 food per route if the city is Mogadishawi or +2 culture if not. These are now dotting the Mogadishawi coast and helping those cities grow nice and big.</p>"

    narration: "<p>For the eagle eyed viewers who were not me (I got like a bit over 4 hours of sleep I’m gonna miss some things…), Singapore took Tamontaka and Mulka and now the cities have flipped back to Noongar. Their fleet is looking a fair bit weaker compared to the last time we saw it, while Singapore is starting to get a few ships around. Wonder how long this can last. Singapore has a lot less production than Noongar, but Noongar of course has to divert attention to a two front war, and they don’t have all coastal cities to build frigates in like Singapore can. At least they don’t have to fight Siam I guess.</p>"

But time will tell if the Selkups can push past the Urals and break into the Kazan core.</p><p></p><p>As it stands, Kazan somehow has 1 more production than the Selkups, but are outclassed in every other regard.

They only get cities from peace deals, and the Crow can’t give any more cities away now. Their only hope yet is to actually put their army to use and take Baaxawuaashaliiko themselves.

    narration: "<p>The sounds of war change, the people don’t. First it was the advent of steel, the swords grew longer and heavier. Every clash reverberated back to the wielder. Now it’s the advent of guns. Handheld muskets making a sickening crack to drown out the sound of bodies slumping to the ground. Every shot a horrid glimpse at the wretched reality of man. Enkh knew no other. Drafted into the Mongolian army as soon as he was of age, he was forced to learn to shoot before he learned how to drink. An Arkhi with ice would’ve done him well. Instead here he sits, in a field of trampled flowers, bandaging an arm from a victory that didn’t feel like it. How could it when all around him were bodies and blood. One could almost say the red stained roses were beautiful if not for the stench of death that infected every petal. The only way Enkh could see this as a victory was if victory was death itself, and he had failed to reach it. </p><p></p><p>Enkh stood up, left arm like a dead weight, musket in his right, prickly rose in his pocket. The war continued, another crack in the distance.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Singapore is getting more ships out and also more knights, they seem to be playing a vital role in taking cities for both parties really. Mulka falls once more as Noongar gets more units set up on Java. If Singapore wastes all their units attacking Mulka which can be easily retaken with land units then it will give Noongar greater ability to harass Raffles Place and whatever city that is off to the left. But really, Noongar should probably be looking to make peace soon while they are still ahead. Maybe try to nab one more city but the defensive fleets are quickly growing. Come on Noongar I believe!</p>"

On that note, were those Mexican citadels there before? I’m not gonna go check. (I did go check, they were but it was in the corner and not commented on.

Thule though, does have open borders with Gogurt, and is using that to get right up to trapped ships and jeer at them from the decks. Honsho-ji looks like it’s pretty safely in Thule hands, and Visk’vo is starting to take damage. Really, Nivkh needs to start producing a bunch of units up in their arctic cities. </p>"

Another leader asked “Well, what did they do?” Shaybani spat on the ground and Mdluli gave a death glare, “They know what they did.” No one, in fact, knew what they did.

    narration: "<p>At the grand opening of the Porcelain Tower, a masterpiece of Faroese architecture on a platform just off the coast of Torshavn, Great King Trondur i Gotu was trying very very hard to ensure people did not look slightly away from the main attraction to where hordes of protestors with guns were chanting slogans against the arrogance of the elites. A fancy tower dedicated to the sciences would not solve the depression gripping the nation. No, they needed actual help. For too long has the noble class been able to siphon the economic might of the country solely to the top, and to ensure that despite the amount of food produced the people only got barely enough to survive. A pitiful display of extravagance this tower was. And once the ceremony is over the gunfire will begin and all that will be left of the protestors is a pile of corpses and an ever persistent resentment.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the world, Ishtar is glad she got out, what a terrible place.</p>"

No wars out here, just endless snow. So much snow. A white blanket covering the hills and forests. That reminded him, the only blanket Altan was provided was threadbare. He was told it was because the good blankets needed to go to the soldiers out east, but they had body heat at least. Out here, there was nothing. He shivered, the fingers on his hand had been turning blue for a while. How long had he been up here today? 10 hours? He was so tired… Maybe he just needed to sit down for a bit, wrap himself up in his shitty blanket and reheat. As he curled up against the wall he felt his eyes closing. It would be okay, nothing happens here.</p><p></p><p>Altan awoke to the rumbling of hooves, the cracking of the wooden supports, and gravity dragging him down with the rest of the watchtower.

Anyways, Shang after taking so long to get out of anarchy, has built up an army and is intent on retaking the cities they lost to Mongolia in the previous war. This is looking quite bad for Mongolia, the only neighbor not attacking them right now is the Dzungars who famously don’t like attacking.

The ground he stepped through was a mulch of petals and limbs. </p><p></p><p>When Enkh returned to the nearest medical bay there was an air of celebration, evidently not for the battle he was just in. No, people were celebrating the end of the war. It gave him a slight feeling of relief before the burning sensation in his shoulder shook him out of it. It was not the true end. He knew they’d just be redeployed to the south and soon become just like their fallen comrades, and so would he. Enkh hobbled into the nearest tent and painfully sat down to wait his turn for the surgeon. People from outside came in to commemorate the injured. What a bunch of misguided fools.</p><p></p><p>A wreath of flowers was draped around his neck. He couldn’t stand the smell of them.</p>"

Though Thy has informed me that these are galleons which only have 4 movement.

These northern cities were almost impossible for Mongolia to hold, but they aren’t that great so in the long run it’s not the worst that could happen. Still sucks though, especially to the people living there who got trampled and shot and frozen. But it’s okay the government doesn’t really care about them so they don’t count.</p>"

Of course, it was obvious, but he needed hard proof of the scams going on. A paper trail led to the gates of Fernandina and from there to the office of MacGregor. A good a time as ever to start a war, the Taino are already at the walls of the city.</p>"

But it is nice for England to always be doing 10 damage to cities each turn, once they get to the siege part that 10 extra damage a turn can be quite helpful. </p><p></p><p>Also a Faroese fleet slowly, slowly starts heading towards Iberia.</p>"

Ikko Ikki still can’t make boats and honestly what are they even doing? Like, they need to use their production for good and defend themselves, or try and make peace before the losses are too much.

I like how the former Shawnee capital is the largest city by far here, and also how Pueblo has citadeled the Osage capital of Ni-o-sho-de very well.

Dai Viet started off strong, had nice settles, and nice culture, but ultimately failed to capitalize on their position and slowly wasted away. They had initial wins against Zheng but then let Zheng build up and settle and ultimately turn things around and take them out. At least they have left their final city to the culture powerhouse of Siam who will also stagnate more but has higher chances of doing things.</p>"

Now they want it back, and maybe Lothal too.

The latest battle, when a small group of cavalry had launched a surprise attack while they were camped out for the night on the road to Xiaotun, left Enkh with a limp and another hole in him. His arm was doing better, the stiffness and occasional spasms accounted for in how he wielded his gun. Yet still, every movement had a slight ache to it, a faint sting to every action. At least now he was old enough to drink away the pain at night. Alcohol to numb the physical pain, a traumatized mind to numb the mental. He was a shell of a man dressed up in the flowery visage of a veteran. Maybe the next attack would bring him mercy.</p>"

    narration: "<p>Well, this is useful since I missed it, but Khoshuts have started putting out their UU, the Yaso. The Yaso is a lancer replacement that makes adjacent mounted units have their city attack penalty reversed, and when capturing (or near to a capturing) a city it turns the city to the Khoshut religion. This won’t be the most useful here unless the Khoshuts push Vijay all the way back, which is unlikely.</p>"

I think a big thing is the Gogurt cities that are just, blocking the way for the northern Honshu galleasses to make their way south. I mean, also just Ikko Ikki not building better boats, but a little bit of the cut-off-ness too. Anyways Zheng decides instead of going around Tamaya they are gonna squeeze through the gap and then somehow cross the land in order to attack Shoman-ji.
