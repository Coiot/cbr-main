  narration: "<p>Hello everyone! This is your host Coiot joined today by your game runner LacsiraxAriscal to finish off the season. We do not normally end a season this way with the top dogs (coyote and fox in this case), but we have also never ended a season all the way through without a reset or minification of some form, so this all calls for celebration! </p><p></p><p>There was quite a challenge for me in this last narration batch, not only because the signup numbers get low at the end of a season—Do signup! We’ve had many first time writers knock it out of the park easily so don’t be intimidated—but I always want to maintain interest and have each episode be a banger. It is common for me to see on Discord that the latest episode ‘is the best one yet’ and that makes a lot of this hard effort worth it. We could have eked out an episode between this and the last few and distributed the slide count to a more normal level, but the action would have ended in awkward moments and so many thanks to Sonicfan, Orange, and Nope for giving it their 110% to deliver more writing to bring everyone better overall drama. </p><p></p><p>Having said that, this is the finale, and by the end there is an undisputed winner. Since almost the start of the season we made this fact known and now we are here to deliver. Every year we get better and make an ever more entertaining Civ AI game and we’ll continue doing so as long as you keep coming back to watch.     </p>"

  narration: "<p>My first OC to highlight is actually a series of new OC to keep the community company in the interim between seasons. The Great Game is a game hosted on Youtube by Kazia that is directly inspired by the CBR with a few tiny adjustments to our formula that might shake things up. There are a few innovations therein that we might see next season here as well. I consume our own show almost entirely through the audio on Youtube, so audio folks in particular may enjoy. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@RajaKazia'>Go over to her Youtube channel</a> to catch up on the releases so far. </p>"

  narration: "<p>A big and mighty thank you to everyone who donated this season! It is without exaggeration nor the usual talking points you now have to hear across the internet when you view other content creators, but this is all made possible by the names listed here. It is difficult and time consuming to produce this content, and in a sense I have to be both always present but at a distance with the audience as I know the outcome of the game, with each of its twists and turns, almost from the time you will be reading episode 1. It is emotionally difficult and I appreciate everyone that can pitch in to keep the wheels moving. </p>"

  narration: "<p>I want to shoutout Singapore this final episode for a truly wonderful performance across the game. Unique and excellent, Singapore was our only Neutrality civ this game and always stood outside normal expectations and predictions. Striking when needed and where necessary, they grow their empire in the small pockets of opportunity available to them. Even up until the end they had a few wondering if maybe just maybe they still had it in them to pull an upset. Such a civ is quite enduring! The pink menace will be remembered fondly for years to come. </p>"

The rebuild has taken priority, and signs of the decades-long struggle can still be seen over the mountain tiles that will forever radiate with the sins of nuclear warfare. Siam makes a cameo on the edge of the screen, praying they too will remain on the periphery of everyone else’s attention.   </p>"

  narration: "<p>The first elimination of the episode is for the Selkups. Having survived the maelstrom that was the literal cyclone of Nexii hovering above the entire horizon over Hsia, the Selkups had literally no possible defense once the storm was lifted. Living off borrowed time, the clock ticked awfully faster for the Selkups as the reaper with the skyscraper long scythe claws took a swipe. </p><p></p><p>The Selkups (to me) have a mixed legacy with moments of utter brilliance between long periods of inactivity. Vonya lived up to the baseline expectations of claiming their portion of the map with ease after the initial scare that Kazakhstan posed for them. That was around T200, and we all felt that the dominoes might have started falling from there considering the weak targets at their gates. </p><p></p><p>Instead the Selkups waited for a weakened Mongolia to loosen its grip on the steppes before stepping up, which in turn caused a big internal crisis as the Dzungars came to their cousin's aid and dived a dagger at their exposed flank. It looked like the status of top regional power was over for Vonya if not for a poorly managed war with several tactical blunders on the part of Galdan Khan. Vonya relished in his good fortune, and his hordes of battle-tested troops vaulted over the Urals and laid waste to Kazan.</p><p></p><p>Once more it felt like the Selkups could break out at any moment and possibly build enough momentum to be the top power, but a grinding war with Goguryeo and several missed opportunities meant that it was not until after T600 that the Selkups once again marched westward to expand their empire, but the growth opportunities could have been much greater if timely strikes at an early time have come.  Looking large, but technologically behind, a last minute joint operation with the Osage against the Dzungars before Total War grabbed them a bit of sizable buffer between them and Goguryeo, but Goguryeo’s generals had eyes only for the hunks in fishing gear so after withstanding the initial waves of top tier units, the Selkups green was replaced with red, or the green of the map as their cities turned to dust.

Unknown to those wishes, Rava V through galaxy level clairvoyance or luck made a wild gambit to take poorly defended Tukana. Futile in the grand scheme of things, but have to respect the gall.

  narration: "<p>Eagle eyed viewers may have noticed that Palawa actually died 3 turns ago but so inconsequential was their passing that Lacs did not notice herself until sometime later.</p><p>Palawa rose to a high rank at the beginning on the season with what looked like a stellar opening and initial city settling followup but that was about as good as it would get. Tarenorerer can count on a few bright spots to her record, namely successful skirmishes here and there and let them expand their reach all the way to the western shores of South America and even the shores of Mauritius. </p><p>Despite those moments, their legacy will be mired by continual fueding with Noongar over central Australia, often losing ground when at the start it looked like fortune was on their side. Such bad blood was shared between Yagan that the long statlemting bouts meant that niether civ could break out to even be considered a regional power. </p><p>Even so, Palawa would outlast Noongar for quite some time (turn count wise) due to their close ties to Wahgi. That close relationship was key to their survival, offering to be a bootlicker in return for the chance to finish the tech tree like so few others civ got the chance to. This would come back to hurt the Wahgi later as Palawa sucker punched them good while they ere distracted with Signapore, but to most the bruising from first Osage and then the humuliation of being blown away by Yellowknives meant that their gains would come to any good. </p><p>All in all, a middling performance, perhaps reflected at more negatively than is reasonable considering a significant amount of the roster performed far worse and achieved much less. The game could easily have been quite different if Palawa had kept it together early on to keep Wahgi in check. </p>"

But one red button and one vanished city later and it’s all over. The Wahgi are eliminated in 6th place.</p><p></p><p>We’ll be getting full eulogies from the Power Rankers in due course, so rather than give a formal recap, I’ll offer my own thoughts and feelings about the Wahgi from when I actually recorded this damn show. It was clear early on they were in a good position to imitate Timor-Leste’s legendary ascendance, but their failure to consolidate Australia always left me feeling a little cold on them. That said, I was surprised to see the narrative weavers cast them as the ultimate supervillain - I thought their smart expansions (if agonising unit balance) made them pretty entertaining. I suppose anyone starting next to Bora Bora was unlikely to endear themselves to many, but I couldn’t help but have a soft spot for Bol’im.</p><p></p><p>With all that having been said, I was absolutely terrified come total war. I was very sure it was their game to lose, and when it quickly became clear that was far from the case, I was so relieved. About 100 turns earlier, I was worried we would have the most transparently boring endgame the CBR has ever seen, as the Wahgi mega-forces simply flipped the Cylinder in a matter of minutes. When you’re running the game, you don’t get the live stats - I had no idea how badly their production, science or gold was doing, only having the sheer numbers to go off. I’m impressed Power Rankers managed to correctly guess they were the most delicate of glass cannons.</p><p></p><p>And with that, the Wahgi have certainly enshrined themselves in CBR legend. Never before have we seen a civ extend so far and yet crumble so fast. Take your well earned, well overdue rest, Bol’im.</p>"

They definitely got an oversized benefit from never really being on the receiving end of a Wahgi drubbing, and scooping up their territory once they collapsed.

There were a number of civs I really found myself rooting for - Kanem-Bornu, Mogadishu, Sierra Leone and these fellas, probably a hangover from me liking Nzinga all the way back in CBR Mk. II. While recording I did feel like they were edging Sierra Leone, and so wasn’t as surprised as stats-watchers were when they successfully united the continent come total war. A great showing from them, and I can’t wait to see Nzinga come back in CBRX8.</p>"

Reload attempts instantly fail, as expected. With the Faroes only barely clinging on, and with the assault on North America only just beginning, I do wish we could’ve gone just a little further. But fortuitously, Goguryeo had just completed their total takeover of Afro-Eurasia. They are unquestionably the largest civ we have ever seen on a full sized CBR map, and are the well-deserved champions of CBRX4.</p><p></p><p>Thank you so much to everyone for tuning in for another insane season. We really hoped to be able to finish this game properly for the first time in history, and the data we’ve gathered from this attempt will really help us out next time, but I’m still so proud to say that a 61 Civ Battle Royale has, for the first time, been confidently won in a single cycle. Thank you to all our narrators, power rankers, content makers, patrons and readers; we wouldn’t be here without you. CBRX5 is already in pre-production, and we’ll have our first ballot announcements coming very, very soon.</p><p></p><p>As a final, parting note… zoom in on the minimap. Do you see what I see? Right there in the Pacific? Perhaps this was a good time to crash the game after all.</p><p></p><p>See you all soon. Lacs out.</p>"
