  narration: "<p>Hello, ladies and not ladies! Welcome back to another episode of the Civilization Battle Royale Twitter Four (CBRX4 for short). I, CelestialDalek, am your narrator for this week, unless you are listening to the audio narration. In that case, I am DocIdo. Well, I don’t really know if it’s fair to say that, since DocIdo didn’t write these words. The person writing these words is CelestialDalek and the person reading them is DocIdo. Forget it let’s just get into the episode that you came here for.</p>"

Their loss, I suppose, since the Faroes are just clearly better. They have what it takes and Gogurt is just weak yogurt. Sheeps eat yogurt for breakfast, if they even have a concept of meals.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We begin with a shot of scenic Eastern Europe. The birds are chirping in the forests, the vast expanses of plains are rapidly being turned into farmland, and there is not a mountain in sight. But you would be remiss to call it peaceful, for Latvian leader Karlis Ulmanis has awoken to a rude shock on his desk. During his morning routine of cutting open absurd AI trade proposals, he finds a joint war declaration from the neighboring nations of Kazan and Makhnovia. He pensively looks out his window: neither of these civs can do that much harm to him. Unfortunately, Makhnovia’s UA has been fired and the anarchists of Riga (and also Jurmala) are in revolt, marching around the palace doors. It’s unlikely that any cities will switch hands around the Latvian mainland: Kazan has jackshit on their border, and Makhnovia is probably going to stalemate. Ulamnis’ dream of retaking Rezekne for Latvia will have to wait.</p>"

Joe Medicine Crow wakes up, opens up the letters, and finds his own joint war declaration from the Faroes and Mexico before promptly throwing them away. Neither pose any threat. The only wars that matter here have yet to happen: the inevitable fight against Pueblo or the Yellowknives. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, this slide presents an opportunity to look at the Pueblo’s UU: the Lada:kwe, a Composite Bowman replacement that can move after being purchased, does more damage against wounded units based on the number of religious buildings in its home city, and is cheaper to purchase with Faith. For now, none of this is very impactful.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Shang are in complete freefall. Daji is in complete and utter shock that her citizens do not like her policy of “we kill you, your fellow citizens might get a luxury”. Every city except their capital is in revolt. Their military score can only go down, down, down. Her neighbors are even more mad. Mongolia has retaken Old Sarai and took Xiaotun last part, and Yuanjunmiao is almost certainly going to fall. It remains to be seen whether the Mongolian/Goguryeo coalition will have enough steam to penetrate further. The citizens won’t put up any resistance apart from in their own cities.</p>"

A couple ships are pointlessly harassing Rabat. The Visigoths would be much better suited to fight this war, since the big prize of Meknes is completely open to their fleet. However, given how their siege of Asturica is going, I wouldn’t trust them to hit the broad side of a barn. At least Sierra Leone has taken some cities.</p>"

If successful, it will prove to be a proud Boragin story for the new city. However, it likely won’t be. The triremes attacking it must funnel through a one-tile gap and can only attack from one tile. We can’t discern much else about the war from this slide apart from the fact that Ballardong is not in imminent danger. However, Wahgi does have crossbows, a feat which few if any civs can match. Unfortunately for them, they are not fighting any land wars in which crossbows will be useful.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kazakhstan continues to be ripped apart by the Selkups like a dog tearing through meat. Almaty falls and is set ablaze, but is likely to stop burning - Karaganda was in the early stages of being razed a few turns ago, but the brave Selkup firefighters reversed Vonya’s rash decision. Shymkent and Semey are next on the chopping block, with Pavlodar being an optimistic goal. Only a peace deal with the Selkups can save Kazakhstan at this point. </p><p></p><p>To the west, the Kazan-Latvia war is completely stagnant. You’d be forgiven for not thinking it was going on. Most of Kazan’s military is fighting to take Shymkent, and most of Latvia’s military is… uhh… somewhere.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The siege of Asturica has to go down as one of the most incompetent battles ever fought in military history. They should have taken it long, long ago, but Leovigild staunchly refuses to take it now. In a speech in Toledo, he states that “we do not want any chance of Burgundarian reconquest. We have lost Asturica once, we do not want to lose it again. The fewer of our citizens who are killed in urban warfare, the better.” Most of the army has been sent out to sea or around the Pyrenees to initiate a surprise attack, but is anyone really fooled? A few pikemen are continually softening the city up so that they can attack when the time is ripe, if it ever is. At this rate, it won’t be. We can also see England’s UA in effect, damaging Burgundy’s cities due to their garrison in Amiens. Sadly, it doesn’t seem to have helped.</p>"

This would be a completely inconsequential war, as despite the fact that they are on the same continent, they do not share a border. Maybe he got Ludwig and Latvia confused - they both start with L and have six letters. Is Ishtar even a trustworthy source, or is this just gossip going around Kirmukarmun? Jumping into the war against Latvia could gain them Jurmala, but they’re not plotting against Latvia. We can see that the frontlines against Makhnovia and Kazan are both going nowhere, which is to be expected considering the fact that the war has been going for all of one turn.</p>"

What will he do on Saturdays if they cut off access to Ludwig’s channel on Twitch? In a meeting with the Babylonian Spy Agency back at the sub, he requests a move to Gungnae, Goguryeo. Over there, Twitch is unfettered and he can freely tune in to the Minecraft castle-building streams. </p>"

Go ahead and keep it.” Although he intended to continue the war, Lee, as well as all of the diplomats, take and happily accept this as a peace offering. Unfortunately, the Spratly Islands are very much divided between the waters of Bac Giang and Thai Nguyen. There will never be peace there, even in the CBR. </p><p></p><p>While peace is made in Palawan, war continues to rage in Borneo. Maguindanao’s last refuge of T’Bok is falling under ranged barrage from the combined Zheng and Wahgi armies. Only Wahgi has a melee unit within striking distance, but Zheng could maneuver that horseman around Sulawesi. It’s a tossup, but it’s not going to go in Maguindanao’s favor.</p>"

Saba’s military presence in this region isn’t as high as it once was, so don’t expect to see a massive sub-Saharan war break out over the fate of Minya. Also, did you know that the Mamluks and Kanem-Bornu are still at war? Their troops sure don’t!

Kazakhstan, too. Can’t have them take Kyzylorda back.” </p><p></p><p>Fortunately for any Kyzylordans, Kazakhstan is rather preoccupied. The walls are closing in on Shymkent, and although Semey has yet to take damage it will soon. Kazan seems to have remembered that they are in fact at war with Latvia, and has sent a contingent of their military north to take Kyzylorda. Ulmanis doesn’t exactly have a defensive force to retain it, and its defensive strength is lacking.</p>"

It’s being razed, but its citizens are glad that the burning houses provide some warmth in their frigid hellhole. His military now consists of one spearman and one composite bowman, and no less than 5 fresh carracks are approaching Guaiba. Once it is taken, Rio Grande will be eliminated. They will need a defense bug of epic proportions to survive this one. Maybe Maurits will send his pikemen and catapults back to fight Tiwanaku instead of using them to stomp on a nearly-dead rump that can only be attacked efficiently by sea.</p>"

Their military is neither strong nor technologically advanced, but they do completely surround Bakjak. I’m not saying that a war with Goguryeo would be a good idea, but… it’s not like the Goguryeo maintain an active military presence on the border. Go in, take Bakjak and Geonan, go out. Easy as that! Who cares about military size and technological superiority when you have an ambush?</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Khoshuts are at war with Shang, believe it or not. Apparently Gushi Khan doesn’t, because he sent merely three chariots out to observe the city. The Himalayas are tough to get through, but there is literally no defense around Dawenkou. As such, it has taken far more damage than it deserves. We can get a pretty good shot of all of Shang’s fronts here, and it looks like Daji will live to kill citizens another day. The Zheng offensive has stalled after taking Qingliangang, Goguryeo attacked Yuanjunmiao and fucked off, and Mongolia doesn’t have the muster to trek farther in. This was a disastrous coalition for them, but it went better than it could have gone. </p><p></p><p>Over in Europe, Leovigild decides that the siege of Asturias isn’t enough.

Tiwanaku is surrounding the purely undefended city of Piratini, the former Riograndenese capital. If I were Puni, I wouldn’t make the trade, but he has no other choice. Without Cacapava do Sul, Piratini cannot be reinforced. Their military is finally being put to good use, though: Ecuador and New Holland cannot say as much, as they’re dicking around in the Amazon and occasionally taking potshots at Tiwanaku’s cities. It’s up to Bora-Bora to save this coalition.</p>"

But I am mad at them for taking Fort San Carlos and destroying Florida’s chances. But look. Florida is still going to win. It’s Gregor MacGreggin’ time, everybody. Somehow. As long as they don’t declare war on Taino, because that navy would shred MacGregor, as well as most of the other Caribbean navies. They’re no Buccaneers, though. Speaking of navies, a poor Tiwanaku scout is going to die in their waters from New Holland’s barrages, an unfortunate casualty of the Amazon War.</p>"

Puni has the city slated to burn, but with the Raze Against The Machine mod the flames in most razed cities are quickly extinguished. The attack on Piratini seems to have been weakened, probably out of shock. Who would have thought that a random Pacific island civ would become a player in South America? But wait.

Although it’s not going to act as a beachhead in this war, it will surely be an important city in future conquests assuming they keep it. The rest of the Tiwanaku coalition is clowning around as usual. Pajchiri has taken *some* damage, and Lukurmata none, and the usual massive Ecuadorian forces are descending upon them, being picked off, and being produced back again. Bora has literally been the only civ to capture a city thus far, in fact they’ve captured five: the island cities of Cajamarquilla, Wiracochapampa, and Machaca; in addition to Omo and Cacapava do Sul. New Holland has LOST one city, Cacapava do Sul, and Ecuador has done nothing. Unfortunately, the navy can proceed no further inland, so this might mark the end of Puni’s conquest of Tiwanaku.</p>"

It’s not like nothing happened: Gwanggaeto’s army has kindly softened up Yuanjunmiao for Sorghaghtani to snatch up. Unfortunately for her, they haven’t done the same to Banpo, so the war is likely going to peter out at this frontline, unless Daji sneaks in and flips Old Sarai. If she does, it will flip back. She’s basically just going to be playing OCC at this point given the state that everywhere but Zhaoge is in. A sad fate for a former top contender.</p>"

While Tarenorerer’s army presents a good course in defense, their offense seems to be lacking. Their army tech is better, but it’s mostly stuck behind the frontlines, and it’s hard to tell if they could push through the swarms of Noongar troops anyways. Another wave looks like it’s coming from the direction of Kriwa to take another shot at Nipaluna and likely fail again. Considering that Palawa seemed destined to retake Kriwa at the beginning of the war, perhaps it’s actually Noongar whose defensive tactics should be studied. </p>"

  narration: "<p>As predicted, the low-health city of Yuanjunmiao finally falls to Mongolia after Goguryeo did all the heavy lifting and then dipped. The citizens were not revolting here under Shang rule before, making them a rarity among Daji’s crumbling empire. However, they seem to miss the constant intrigue of murder, as they’re rioting over their newfound Mongolian rule. But, more surprisingly, it looks like Mongolia has finally coalesced their forces into a military that severely threatens Banpo. If they do take it, the repercussions will be huge: it opens the door to Yinxu and Zhaoge, with fewer defenders around. It’s not like the Shang army will put up with much of a fight. As long as the Dzungars don’t intervene on Daji’s side, Mongolia’s future looks bright.</p>"

Given how “Cape Verde” is just a translation of “Green Cape,” I will be calling the settlement of Sydrugota “Grøna Kap,” the Faroese translation of “Green Cape”. Grøna Kap doesn’t really pose a threat to any African dealings, like the hopeless Sierra Leone-Alaouite war. It’s just there to be cool. Speaking of the war, it’s business as usual: not throwing anything at Rabat, shoving troops into a Marrakesh meatgrinder, and general incompetence. If I were Thomas Peters, I’d quit the war and silently build up troops. But I am not. As it stands, Grøna Kap might be the best hope for peace in the region.</p>"

Ume Sami and the Finns have lived in relative harmony, even though Rapolan looks like the world’s juiciest military target. The biggest threat to peace has been the Faroes, as evidenced by their two former Ume Sami holdings in Norway. Given the tech disparity between the two navies, they are solidly in Faroese hands for now. We also get a look at the Ume Sami’s UU, the Nåjjde, a Great Merchant replacement that gives 2 Gold and 2 Faith for each lake or mountain in their empire.

Send reinforcements please.” He sends a few horsemen up to oblige. While neither side has a lot of military units up here, take a look at Kyzylorda’s city strength. That’s not really a ripe target for easy defense. Luckily for Ulmanis, Möxämmädämin of Kazan (or, as his friends call him, Moxa) has yet to discover Latvia’s other cities. “As far as the Republic of Kazan is concerned, Jelgava and Valmiera are urban legends. Their existence is only as real as El Dorado.” Evidently, the rest of their army agrees.</p>"

If they were on the right continent, this could prove fatal, since Harappa’s military is weak. Their only real protection is the Great Wall of Harappa, but as the Afsharids proved last part, with enough grit and determination you can still pick off their cities.

Soon, all Mogadishu citizens will be allowed to travel to the idyllic island and bask under the dragonblood trees endemic to the island. Harappa stands no chance of holding the besieged, unreinforced, far-flung island. We can also see the dying breaths of the Vijayanagara assault on Sutkagan-Dor, as the city has been beaten into yellow at the expense of the flotilla. The Qarmatians are in a semi-respectable position, just hemmed in from all sides by technological and production disparities.

Basically the entire Swazi navy of five ships is attacking it, with the other three on their way. Mogadishu dreams of one day being able to unify the Indian Ocean under their rule, and if they strike now they have the navy to do it. Unfortunately, Abu Bakr is too shy to declare war on the other civs without being part of a coalition and is waiting for everyone to suddenly hate Eswatini and/or Vijayanagara. It’d certainly make borders a lot nicer. Hluti and Mhlume are annoying obstructions for ship navigation right now, after all. </p>"

This war has seen a massive reversal of fortune for Daji, who we placed #1 in the PRs back in part 3. It only seems like a matter of time before another war brings them down (probably with Zheng and/or Mongolia), but Daji has other matters to attend to for now: writing love letters to fellow serial killer, girlboss, and coalition target Elizabeth Bathory.

Today, Zheng and the Khoshuts have decided to try their hand at taking down Dai Viet, while Siam intervenes on the side of Dai Viet but only against the Khoshuts. Will any cities change hands? Not unless someone makes a moronic peace deal. Will the Khoshuts ever figure out that chariot archers are not a good offensive military unit? No. Thanks to the loss of Lhasa in a peace deal with the Dzungars, Gushi Khan’s empire looks like a gerrymandered district or a dying snake. Thanks to the liberal amount of mountains, the main hope for putting him out of his misery is an attack from Harappa or another stupid peace deal. I’m going to be honest I don’t think Siam is cut out for the job.</p>"

The only problem is, because Cairo got captured, all of the Mamluk’s engineers moved to Narym, the capital of the Selkups, to build it. So it’s not really the Cairo Citadel anymore, but what does that matter? This is going to prove to be an incredibly useful wonder, as it provides +10% combat strength in desert tiles and an attack bonus against cities. Perhaps this will inject new life into the Kazakh war.</p>"

She has tons of production, a good military, but slightly below average techs. Another golden age would be a massive boon and cannot come soon enough for their empire. In the hopes that it will spur a golden age, a peace treaty is signed with Harappa, the first civ to chicken out of the EAAHC (East African Anti-Harappa Coalition).</p>"

  narration: "<p>Finally, some actual action arises in the Indian subcontinent. The Afsharids have decided to attack Vijayanagara, which is certainly a decision. I think they might have gotten confused with Harappa, because the only effect this has is putting Mehrgarh in the danger zone. To get to a coastal city, Nader Shah will have to fight through a ton of triremes to even threaten Mangalapura, which he is simply not able to right now. On the other hand, the Vijayanagaran navy won’t have too much trouble attacking Mehrgarh. This better be part of a coalition, or else Nader Shah is going to regret wasting troops on this.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Over in Alaska, a few barbarians by Kuganajuup appear to have been spawned, but mostly killed off except for one cornered pikeman. Javraganak, on an expedition over there, announces there is only one way to deal with the pikeman. Run at it with horses. This is not going too well.</p><p></p><p>Thule is finally upgrading to carracks, which solves the question of how they’re going to attack Nivkh when they have the same boats. Their core is as easily defensible as ever and is pretty well populated among the mountains too. The real test is breaking out.</p>"

  narration: "<p>After losing the race to Shymkent to Kazan, the Selkup military has finally decided to move on and blitz Semey. With their overwhelming advantage on their side, this is akin to rolling the last remnants of Kazakhstan over in their sleep. However, they do have Tecumseh, who escaped Prophetstown after the Osage took it and has been scooped up as a Great General. Given how Shawnee are dead in 61st, I’m not so sure this is a good sign for the military. It appears like they’re also preempting the fall (sensibly) and are lunging towards Pavlodar to take it straight afterwards. Vonya is showing Nazarbayev zero mercy in this fight.</p><p></p><p>The fight for Kyzylorda is intensifying, as Kazan is bringing up some troops to try and reretake it as Latvia is simultaneously reinforcing it with some carracks. </p>"

  narration: "<p>So, how’s the progress in the anti-Bathory coalition going? As you can see by the slide, it really isn’t going at all. Predictably, the naval attack on Gyor is bottlenecked but Trajan hasn’t committed many ships to the attack anyways. Makhno and Ulmanis have done jackshit. Mithradates has not joined. Trajan REALLY wants some empty land, because by my count he has seven settlers in this slide, including two on Sicily. Maybe if he captures a Hungarian city then he’ll raze it. I don’t know, he won’t. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Osage is doing surprisingly well for their early performance. It really goes to show that eliminating your enemies pays off, a lesson more advisable in the CBR than in the workplace. All that they need to worry about is when Pueblo attacks. They have also recruited Japanese entertainment company cofounder Yoshimoto Sei. Sei’s fellow businessman Gregor MacGregor is off to the side, waiting patiently for the time to strike. It’s going to be soon and nobody will see it coming.</p>"

  narration: "<p>For the final non-menu slide, we get to see New Holland, where Ishtar brings some unfortunate news. Maurits is preparing to wage war against everyone’s favorite civ whose name contains Bora: Bora Bora. Judging by the state of their army, this sure won’t be a land war, but this side of Bora’s domain doesn’t have nearly as many ships to defend itself. </p><p></p><p>Off to the side of the screen, we can see that Tiwanaku has recaptured Lukurmata. Because we can’t see the units to its west, whether or not it flips back at the beginning of next episode is up in the air. Moreno and Maurits continue to lackadaisical chip away at the walls of Pajchiri. Will they take it next episode?! I don’t know, I’m not narrating it. I hope so, because I like New Holland and would love to see their laziness pay off.</p>"
