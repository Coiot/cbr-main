  narration: "<p>Welcome one, welcome all, to yet another episode of the CBRX’s fourth season. It’s me, Semiconscious, back at the helm again, and I promise for my sake and yours to make this one a little shorter than last time. I say that, but we’ve got 115 slides to get through so buckle up.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I love shouting out Nathanmasse’s lovingly crafted info sheet for all the stats nerds out there (including myself) who want to see exactly how well each power is doing. Wahgi’s gold deficit of 29,000 is particularly jarring. I’m also shouting it out for the usefulness of the Current Wars tab as I’m narrating this to see if I miss any DOWs.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Another banger comic from Orange, showing how sad the death of Bora-Bora was. Just as Wahgi left them alone to die a rump, New Holland ensured that they wouldn’t last that long as one. A sad end to a once-great civilization - dead to the man who loves killing. Maurits has 6 eliminations, double that of second placers Goguryeo and Wahgi.</p>"

  scene_title: "El Numero Uno"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season4-pr39-scene32.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Our number one this week again remains Goguryeo, after a relatively successful war against Thule that allowed Little Brother Ikko-Ikki to emerge up a few cities while Goguryeo eliminated any threat from the Americas. Of course, this is largely because the Faroes and Wahgi struggle to play the game correctly, so if one of the two blunders into a good war declaration then this position could be gone quickly.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And we find at the beginning of this episode an end to a war that started at the beginning of the last one. It’s a favorable peace to Ulmanis’s Latvia, as the Selkups seemed to finally be breaking through the Rikala-Tiurinlinna line that had held and caused Jekabpils and Jelgava to flip for so long. Vonya still escapes with 5 more cities, so it’s not a bad deal though.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We see the final stand of Javraganak’s Thule, as Ikko-Ikki paratroopers besiege their final city. Taking it would link up Qaqortoq, the city Thule ceded before the ceasefire in the middle of last episode. With naught but an AA gun and a few naval units, I don’t think Thule stands any chance.</p><p></p><p>Wait, their last city? I thought Thule had one more…</p>"

  narration: "<p>I never thought I’d see the day the Faroes actually used their North American colonies for something. They’ve used it to…take a 3 population snow peninsula city. Well, at least it’s something. </p><p></p><p>Also, say hello to all the Wahgi troops. They’ve apparently infiltrated all the way to the other side of the world.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And the Ikko-Ikki executioners move in for one last strike on the Thule, who finish in 29th. It is said that Javraganak, when given the opportunity to flee to the nuclear submarine, died fighting on the last bridge to the ports, allowing what little remained of the Thule civilian population to escape.</p><p></p><p>Thule was certainly a civ of this CBR. They started out very strong out of the gate, settling much of northern Canada and Alaska and competing with the Yellowknives and Pueblo for the Vancouver area. But then they just…sat there. They waited too long to grow their stats, and saw the Yellowknives gobble up Pueblo, leaving only the Nivkh and Ikko-Ikki as expansion routes. And it is true, Javraganak tried to break out of the box. She just couldn’t. And when one final shot was fired against Ikko-Ikki, big brother Goguryeo came in and helped all but eliminate the Alaska natives.</p><p></p><p>So how will we remember Thule? I’m not sure. On the one hand, they were a statistical power at times, but on the other they could never use the advantage they had over their neighbors. Ultimately, another boxed-in Alaskan civ may be their legacy. A shame, for a civ many thought could escape that fate.</p>"

  narration: "<p>People have been calling the Wahgi the villains of this season. As another Wahgi Apologist, like last week’s narrator, I’m here to point out that the Faroes are far worse. Simply coasting by, killing fan favorite warmongers, and now building Skynet. I’m sure nothing bad will happen to any civ that opposes them…</p><p></p><p>For those who don’t know, Skynet is an amazing wonder, which gives all combat units +10% strength and allows the construction of the Robot Infantry, with 110 Combat Strength and +20% when adjacent to other friendly units.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Here we see for the first time this game the Bavarian unique unit of the Hartschier. It’s a…Lancer replacement. How are you this bad at Science Ludwig? Lancers upgrade to Uhlans, which upgrade to Anti-Tanks, which upgrade to Helicopter Gunships, which only then upgrade to the Drone UAVs we’ve seen scattered around. </p><p></p><p>Ah, wait, I figured it out. Ludwig has okay science, as we’ve seen him with Infantry and Tanks, but his UU does not obsolete. Instead, it gains combat strength when Ludwig constructs wonders and defense when stationed on the Bavarian unique improvement. Ludwig, for reference, has one wonder.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene12.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A bunch of stray war declarations fly Kazan’s way, but none of them are relevant at all. More interestingly, it seems as if this area is filling up with many civilizations’ different units. In Kazan proper, there’s a Thule GWI, a few Wahgi units, a Bavarian Infantry, a Makhnovian Longswordman, and the Rozvi Swordsman. The unit overflow is really hitting the cylinder hard, it seems.</p>"

  scene_title: "Citadel Center"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We check back in on what used to be Mongolia but is now one of the most interesting borders on the cylinder, between Big Three member Goguryeo and Second Tier member Selkups. The technological difference is what really stands out to me here - in a way reminiscent of the Turkey-Tuva border from the last CBR, Goguryeo has fewer units, but those they do have are significantly higher tech Future Worlds units than the Selkups’ Paratroopers and Modern Armor. </p><p></p><p>Also, say hello to the Dzungars with their Line Infantry and Artillery!</p>"

  scene_title: "Dam."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Shifting a bit further south, it seems the trend is the same on this area of Goguryeo’s border as well. Obviously the Dzungars are many eras behind, but even the Wahgi troops carpeting Afsharid and covering Zheng lands are looking a little worse compared to the Goguryeo Battlesuits. It may be a case of quality vs. quantity come Total War in this area. And I’d probably take Goguryeo given how that went in X3.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Roman Wave"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene15.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Rome, of all civs, has a land carpet now. Wow. They’ve now begun spreading peacekeepers into Bavarian lands, perhaps as both recognize the fearful power of the Faroerg. Interestingly, though, Ludwig is keeping his planes much more concentrated on the southern border with Pontus than towards the Great Blue North.</p><p></p><p>As a side note, I’m shocked the Kalmyks still have this many units that exist. I’d’ve thought the Afsharids got far closer to eliminating them fully, and I’m shocked there are still nine knights alive.</p>"

  scene_title: "Osageverflow"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>We see the effects of the brutal citadelling of Osage lands in North America, as unit overflow has moved some of their troops to Australia of all places. Strange, I would’ve thought there was a neighbor nearby with open borders. This is also a good time to check on Australia, and it seems Palawa and Noongar have similar armies in terms of tech, but Palawa’s is significantly more anti-air than Noongar’s tank divisions. Wahgi still dwarfs both in tech and scale - and with 68 and 70 population cities both in frame, I’m not surprised.</p>"
- scene_number: 17
  scene_title: "Osagecarpet"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As I alluded to last slide, the Osage carpet at home is covering the homeland entirely. I’m not sure 60 Combat Strength machine guns are the best use of the space, Pawhuska, but…you’ll get there eventually. The Yellowknives are also surprisingly empty, and their units are only about a tech level above those of Osage. Could the Osage actually win a war with Yellowknives?</p><p></p><p>(*whisper whisper whisper*). Ah, I’ve just been informed that the Yellowknives have the most nukes on the Cylinder, in excess of 150, while the Osage have zero. Never mind.</p><p></p><p>Also, for those keeping track, we’re now at 9/12 slides with Wahgi units visible in them. Are we sure Unit Limits (which is supposed to limit this type of peacekeeper spam) is working?</p>"

  scene_title: "Back to the Future"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene18.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Nzinga Mbande had been hearing rumors. Whispers, among both her people, and others, that she’d been slipping. Sierra Leone’s recent successes in kicking first Rome and then most of Saba-D’mt off the African continent. Nzinga decided she needed a statement. A real reason for her citizens, and her nation, to believe in her again. Rumors had been circling that the Wahgi fleets that circled her shores were bragging about how futuristic they were compared to the “backwards” Ndongo bazookas. That was just it, Nzinga thought. We have to say we’re futuristic now. </p><p></p><p>Ndongo has entered the Future Era. Not sure why, or how; their tech is on a similar level to Sierra Leone but doesn’t have the trademark Advanced Destroyers that would make a war with Sierra Leone interesting.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ah. Well. This should be quick. Remember when I thought Kazan was such a nice multinational meeting place? Vonya didn’t agree and so declared war. All three Kazan cities are in the black by the first turn. Kazan won’t last ten slides is my bet. If anything, though, those same multinational peacekeepers may keep our favorite umlaut warlord around a little longer. </p><p></p><p>Actually, Samara may be a little bit more difficult to conquer, having only a one tile gap to Kazan city and Alexandrovsk. Still, though, the Selkup air superiority is no joke.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And as mentioned, Kazan city immediately falls to the Selkup horde. That’s the last Kazan-founded city Möxämmädämin owned, actually, now moving the capital to Kalmyk-founded Samara while also in possession of Makhnovian Alexandrovsk. Both those civilizations are long dead, lost to the annals of history as Kazan soon shall be.</p><p></p><p>Hey wait a second wasn’t one of those stray war declarations I mentioned from Trajan? Those Roman “peacekeepers” have the opportunity to do the funniest thing.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well, it seems as if nothing interesting is happening elsewhere on the cylinder so we’ll stay here watching Kazan die. Alexandrovsk now falls; it would’ve been really nice to see this happen BEFORE you peaced out with Latvia though Vonya. Rezekne and Huliapole look mighty easy to take.</p><p></p><p>Come on Roman paratroopers, do the funny, you know you want to.</p>"

  narration: "<p>In case Kazan fans were getting tired of seeing their civ get murdered by the Selkups every turn, we decided that the Faroerg’s acquisition of the Tórshavn Shimazu Mega Pyramid was important. It’s a…fine wonder, I guess. It gives some small yields and allows for a couple Future Worlds improvements or buildings to give happiness. Which, now that I think about it, could be crucial for a civ which has lingered for so long on the edge of unhappiness. So it’s not that bad after all! </p>"

  scene_title: "Anti-Elimination Coalition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene23.jpeg
  narration: "<p>It seems Kazan’s status as the World Military Refugee Hub is actually helping. A Thule Great War infantry guards the western approaches to Samara, a Bavarian infantry the northeast, the Rozvi Swordsman the northwest, a  Wahgi paratrooper the east, and a Rozvi Composite Bowman the southwest. The only entrance actually guarded by a Kazan unit, a rifleman, is the southwest, the hardest angle for the Selkup or Roman troops to attack. </p><p></p><p>That being said, when in our timeline a multinational force was put together to attack a city in this same spot on the west bend of the Volga (Stalingrad), it was the international forces that broke to lose the battle. </p>"

  scene_title: "Why is Zheng here?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>It wasn’t a real threat to Azeba. Just…an annoyance. Every couple of days, a parcel would come down from planes carried by Makeda’s enemies. The one biplane that still remained on this side of the Red Sea couldn’t defend the entirety of the city, and so about a couple parcels got through every week. What was in those parcels? Explosives, of course. </p><p></p><p>And yet even as Makeda knew there was no threat from Rome, from Mogadishu, or from Ndongo, the annoyance was still there. They could bombard the city from a thousand feet up, and there was nothing she or her people could do. Of course, the Coalition didn’t want to spend enough forces to actually take the city; they didn’t have the technological or industrial might. And they couldn’t get through Hamar Weyne, the city Makeda ceded to Thomas Peters for exactly this reason. But it seemed to Makeda that that didn’t stop them from trying to be a royal pain in the butt.</p>"

  scene_title: "SNIPE"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>YES!!!!!!!</p><p></p><p>Our first legitimate snipe of a random city by peacekeepers this season comes far too late. No, I don’t consider Wahgi Mexico to be a snipe, it was Wahgi units, they’re everywhere. Roman paratroopers managed to sneak through the AEC lines and kill Möxämmädämin, and the coalition fell apart leading to complete Roman seizure of this outpost  so far away from the rest of their empire. What are they going to do with it? Probably lose it to the Afsharids, Selkups, or Latvia if any ever declare war. </p><p></p><p>On the other side of this snipe, though, there was a death. The Kazan Khanate lived a long, and quite good life, to finish 28th. Möxämmädämin began by expanding early, competing with Nazarbayev’s Kazakhstan for much of the transUral area. Instead of an expected Makhnovia in the west, however, Möxämmädämin had an upstart Latvia. First on the chopping block was the Kalmykian city of Elista, but that was lost to Bukhara in a later war. After returning for Round 2 with the Kalmyks and taking the far more useful Samara (and briefly the capital Astrakhan), the Umlaut King teamed up with the Selkups to take down Nazarbayev, netting a full five cities in the near-complete elimination of a once-forerunner. </p><p></p><p>After that, though, there was only stagnation. With not particularly high-population or productive capacities, Kazan struggled between the twin powers of Latvia and the Selkups. Sure, the elimination of Kazakhstan was scored. But a short war with the Selkups lost them most of their land across the Urals. A longer one lost them their north. And of course, the embarrassing losses of Taraz and then Bolgar to Shaybani’s Bukhara, the enemy Möxämmädämin could never get one over on. Eventually, the Selkups came for the kill, but it was Rome that dealt the final blow. F, to a civ we may forget, or we may remember. I’m not quite sure.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well, it seems Vonya has decided it’s time for the one person who consistently got stuff over on Möxämmädämin to die. And I guess with Kazan gone, it’s only fitting that Bukhara dies now too. Sure, there are peacekeepers and narrow boundaries, but did that stop Vonya with Kazan? Even with the power of heart, grit, clutch, determination, and wanting it more on their side, the balance is simply against Shaybani.</p><p></p><p>For those wondering, no, there was not an immediate DOW, it’s just that nothing interesting happened on turn 648. Nothing.</p>"

  scene_title: "Two down five to go"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode40-scene27.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As mentioned, this is a green wave. The famous cities of Taraz and Bolgar, the greatest successes Bukhara has ever seen, have both already fallen. It’s surprising, honestly, how good the Selkups are doing. Bukhara has significantly better tech than Kazan had, with Infantry and anti-air rivaling some African powers. But it just isn’t enough. I’ll be interested to see how the Dzungar peacekeepers affect things though, but a Selkup paratrooper north of Turkistan behind Bukharan lines tells me it won’t do much. It’s sad to see such a legend obliterated like this.</p>"

What that means to a group of people who were already cyborgs nobody really knows. </p><p></p><p>As for the wonder itself…it allows the civ to upload citizens to gain more yields, as well as buffing yet more FW improvements with science, culture, and production.

  narration: "<p>I wasn’t going to mention it last slide, but it is simply shocking to see Wahgi peacekeepers covering another of the Big Three powers. Drone UAVs and Artillery cover the entirety of Quebec, with only the sea spaces (themselves occupied by Faroese Destroyers) being open. In all honesty, so many of these currently-Wahgi-peacekeeper-covered areas will be interesting come Total War. How much can Wahgi gain, temporarily? How much becomes long term gains? What does that mean for those who don’t suffer from the Purple-and-Yellow Pus?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Rumor has it that secretly Pawhuska was happy for Chetopah to be surrounded by Mexican and then Yellowknife Kanawagas. After the initial war after the Crowalition, Pawhuska and Akaitcho had grown to admire one another. And Chetopah becoming a city state meant that Pawhuska had an excuse to move all non-essential personnel to…safer places. Like a deThuleization of Pituffik. Or a deTainoization of Fernandina and Yuma. Those places had to be…integrated. All scientific personnel remained, however, and Akaitcho arranged for certain secrets to be leaked to the Osage scientists in Chetopah. Military testing grounds were all around; it would only be expected that something may just accidentally cross the border.</p><p></p><p>With those new secrets, the Osage scientists got to work. And finally, they announced their success. In 2126, though without an actual test, Pawhuska broadcast to the world that his scientists had joined so many others in completing the Manhattan Project.</p>"

What happened to your paratrooper north of Turkistan, did it get too busy pillaging? It seems the war that I thought would be (metaphorically) over by Christmas has instead lasted. Bukhara is really adding to their legendary underdog always-keep-fighting resume. Very well done, and we’ll see if they can survive this war. </p><p></p><p>Most interestingly though is that Turkistan and Bukhara city are actually at full health. Remember the Selkup air dominance over Kazan? That doesn’t seem to be present here unlike what the first turn made me think.</p><p></p><p>In recognition of a fellow rump fighting well, Leovigild signs an irrelevant peace deal with Shaybani.

The third coming was the second-longest of the Qarmatian independent periods, and certainly was fun to see. It just simply wasn’t meant to last, like all good things on this cylinder. A shame, really. </p><p></p><p>Now onto Saba-D’mt. What to say about this civ that hasn’t already been said. They started off slow. So very slow. Them, along with the Floridas, were the only civs without a second city at the end of Episode 1. But they burst out like a cannon, as by the end of Episode 4 they had a strong four cities. After some more blobbing, we realized how powerful they were when they hit their second Golden Age. Saba’s UA gives them food and production equal to half the gold trade route income during a golden age. With trade and gold-heavy Mogadishu as a neighbor, this was a massive boon. They hit 10th place by the 9th PR, and an all time peak of SIXTH after Episodes 16 & 18. What did they do with that, you ask? A whole lot of nothing. Skirmishes and failed invasions of the Qarmatians and Kanem-Bornu. A “war” with Ndongo. Getting handed stuff by eSwatini.</p><p></p><p>They then just…sat there. Their golden ages were used in ways we couldn’t figure out, not producing anything to help with science or military purposes. They fought with Pontus over Damietta, making peace too early to actually take the city. Eventually, Mogadishu finally woke up and a brutal, brief war was fought that lost Mogadishu. After a quick intermission to kill Kanem-Bornu after Sierra Leone did all the work, Saba returned again to fight Mogadishu, a war that resulted in Makeda handing the capital back for peace. </p><p></p><p>Then, two episodes ago, Thomas Peters came calling. The peace deal, concluded in the middle of last episode, left Saba with only two cities. After one final escapade to steal a Mogadishiwi city for a few turns, it was only a matter of waiting for Peters to cast the killing blow. In time, it came. F to a civ who had nothing, gained everything, and whose hype train they built simply tumbled off the tracks. </p>"

A fight that Muhammad Shaybani would try his hardest to win and make you pay for. It seemed that most wars Shaybani should lose, he snuck out a city in the peace deal or flipped a city one last time. Remember Pavlodar, the city in the far north Urals he extorted from a near-dead Kazakhstan? None can also forget his wars against the Kalmyks and Kazan, two powers many thought would at least steal cities from him or fight to a white peace, but who lost one and two cities respectively in separate wars. Heck, even Kazakhstan’s presence was feared at one point, leading to a PR0 of 54th place. That’s below such civs as Burgundy and Florida.</p><p></p><p>But eventually, Shaybani lost just enough - he lost Samarkand in a war to Nader Shah, causing the Afsharids to plunge a dagger into Bukhara city with citadels. Elista was lost in the Kazakh war, and would fall to the Afsharids too. And so this five-city empire lived on, scrappy as can be as their big neighbors tried again and again to conquer them. And I thought for sure the Selkup attack on them would be the end. But Shaybani escaped from that, too, with still three cities to his name. Nader Shah, though, the only person to defeat the Bukharan Khanate both in reality and in the CBR before this episode, decided to come back for round 2. And just as in reality, 92 Uzbek tribes found themselves scattered and conquered by the Afsharid Empire.

Sayed Darwish, the most famous of these, left with Leovigild’s personal guard. Darwish, famous in our timeline for founding Egyptian pop music by modernizing older folk tunes to new audiences, did the same here, with “Leyendas de Asturica” being his most popular work.</p><p></p><p>In other news, the Visigoths are finally dead. They were a civ that lasted far too long by pretending to not exist. We all thought they broke out of Iberia with their settlement of Asturica beyond the Pyrenees, but at the first opportunity they handed it over to Bavaria, who then lost it to Burgundy. And at the end of the Great English Success (the third Anglo-Burgundian war), just when it looked like the Visigoths could retake the city, it was handed over to England for peace. The Visigoths never recovered, losing Emerita to the English in a short skirmish and having Salisbury settled where a Visigoth city once stood. Sierra Leone’s pack of vultures came next, for Barcino and Narbo on the east coast. After the Faroes destroyed Western Rome and England, though, they didn’t continue onto the Visigoths. So Leovigild just sat there. Existing. For at least a hundred turns.

And given Yellowknife air and nuclear weapon superiority, with Qikiqtaruk already in the deep red and Qaqortoq already fallen, perhaps there was no choice. It’s better to go out fighting than it is to sit there and dig in. Why not lose your colonies with a bang, instead of a whimper?</p>"

Trajan is also down to just 7 planes in the area.

  narration: "<p>Back to the other active war on the cylinder. As I hinted, Malkerns flipped to Ndongo, and I think it’s done that a few times. This looks like the beginning of the end for the Mogadishu defense, though, as Ndongo is bringing its fleet, complete with a 4-aircraft Supercarrier, to truly bear against the weak Uwassiyes. Shangani has also lost ten population. That’s not half or more as you’d expect from a flip. No, that’s a nuke I think. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Why. Just why. </p><p></p><p>Let’s focus on the good and expected stuff first. Irtysh fell, and it took eight turns (707-715) to completely evict the defenders from the area. Meanwhile, Uliastai still stands and Tarbagatai remains undamaged. Ili has lost a bit of population, but I’m unsure if that’s from a nuke or simply starvation. There also seems to be a legitimate defensive line, made of Dzungar units, forming near Tarbagatai and Gyangtse. Twenty three Dzungar planes are still in the air. </p><p></p><p>Now for the bad news: Goguryeo’s entered the war, and brought the little brother Ikko-Ikki along too. They have 48 planes or nukes in this slide alone and three Nexuses. The successes up to this point have been dwarfed by this absolutely terrible failure. I know there are only three slides left, but I’m scared to scroll on and look at them. </p>"

  narration: "<p>As I thought. While two turns have passed, Ili and Uliastai still stand, and seventeen Dzungar planes remain in the air, that’s about all the good news. Yulduz fell while we were focusing on the eastern front, and Gyangtse is already on black health. That’s to say nothing of Ürümqi, which has already fallen to a strike group that is now fives nexuses and two battle suits - and the same 36 planes but now with whatever’s inside the Nexuses too. Is this what it felt like, Bora-Bora fans? To see Wahgi just rolling over you and destroying you? I feel your pain.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well, I didn’t see that one coming! It seems Nzinga has temporarily given up on taking Malkerns to instead send a strike group to take the Mogadishiwi metropolis of Merca on Madagascar. And it worked - the city was flipped and, while it probably flips, is a key psychological and emotional victory. And even if they can’t hold it this time around, Abu Bakr Ibn Umar only has a limited supply of units that can re-flip the city. Nzinga seems to just keep summoning units from the south. </p><p></p><p>Also, Shangani has lost four more population - perhaps it was just starvation after all. I still think nukes are a viable explanation too, but I’d need an expert to confirm. </p>"

  narration: "<p>I’m speechless. Tarbagatai, the one city that I thought was safe as it had been on full health, the pinnacle of Dzungar civilization at a once-grand 35 population, has fallen to the Selkups. Ili and Uliastai still stand purely because it takes too long to march through the hills and neutral Wahgi UAVs patrol the sky. Gyangtse, too, will almost certainly fall next turn. </p><p></p><p>But hey, at least the Osage’s meme capture of Petropavl is still theirs?</p><p></p><p>That’s all I’ve got for you tonight, and thank you for reaching or listening to my wild ramblings. This was a long one, with many twists and turns along the way. Some fun moments, and some heartbreaking ones. I hope you stay with us to see this season out, and prepare for Total War in two or three episodes! It’s been me, Semiconscious, and I’ll see you on the other side. Let me just sit here for one last time, watching the sunset in Samara.</p>"
