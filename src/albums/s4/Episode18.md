She had heard that the almonds from her favourite long-life snack on the submarine originated in Central Asia, where almonds were domesticated. </p><p></p><p>However, once she had settled in, she realised that whilst she could find the almonds, she couldn’t source the right combination of flavoured salt and spices herself. She also missed the satisfying crinkling sound made by the foil packets as she opened them to extract the nutty goodness within. Of course the Selkups hadn’t invented industrial packaging and processing methods. Consequently, her supply of decent almonds is running low, and Astana, a rather small city, isn’t exactly a culinary paradise.</p>"

Currently, Saba-D’mt has a slight advantage in production, military size and military technology. Saba-D’mt is also an absolute money-spinning machine with world-beating income and gold reserves, which makes sense as their unique faction attributes are really structured to favour gold output. So I would have to give Saba-D’mt the edge, but Ndongo is not going to roll over easily.</p>"
