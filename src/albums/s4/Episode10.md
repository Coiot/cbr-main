  narration: "<p>Here in calm Siberia, things are not as calm as the seem. The Koreans have hardly any units here, and why should they? The Nivkh land military is quite small, consisting of chariot archers pulled by reindeer. That lack of a military is probably why two civs just declared war on them. Their enemies should be wary though: they have a decent navy, with their UU that can switch between land and sea. Wait, nevermind its the Kazakhs and Mongols declaring war. I love relevant wars.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We pop into the Pontus-Hungarian war, where the cheeky pontus have sniped Gyor and are razing it. Will this save them? No. But it’s going to be very difficult for Hungary to retake Gyor before it burns, and there are plenty of eager civs who might settle in its place if it does. It also forces Elizabeth to divert her forces to retake the city. Jokes on Mithridates though, she likes it when her citizens die.</p>"

  scene_title: "I’m just Kinema"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene11.jpeg
  narration: "<p>After many years of fighting, Sierra Leone’s Kinema falls to the Alouites, after they already lost Salé and Fez to Sierra Leone. I think Sierra Leone takes that trade. Fortunately for the alous they far outnumber Sierra Leone outside Kinema, and should hold the city easily. However, we should keep an eye on Tangier. The Sierra Leone navy harasses the city, and more importantly there are three Sierra Leone swordsmen nearby and relatively few Alouites units nearby. As Tangier only has 10 strength, swordsmen could do massive amounts of damage to the city quickly.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Nivkh navy begins to harass the eeky-eeky city of Honsho jr. The city has full health, but a defense equivalent to the strength of a trireme. With the eeky navy nowhere to be seen, this could be dangerous.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Faroes continue to grow in Vinland. However, we should note their near total lack of land forces here. A concerted effort by the Seneca to move their armies north could wreak a devastating, but non-fatal blow against the Faroes. They could lose all these cities and still arguably be the top civ in the game. Eagle eyed viewers may spot sheep outside some of these Faroe cities- likely spawned in by their unique building. That makes these tundra cities better than they might appear at a glance. They’ll make a strong asset for the Faroes if they are kept, or an even greater prize for whoever takes them. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Porto Allegre is going to fall nearly immediately to New Holland. I’m pretty sure I missed this war starting because I was distracted by England doing nothing last episode. Regardless, this will fulfill the prophecy everyone made when they first saw this city being settled.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Chaozhou is retaken by Zheng. It’s embarrassing that this city ever fell, and I wish it was razed. Why wouldn’t they just settle on Taiwan? That’s like, the entire thing Zheng is known for historically. Hopefully someone will eventually raze this city so new holland can settle on Taiwan. Maybe then Zheng will activate his historical persona.</p>"

  scene_title: "The prophecy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Daoist philosopher Wei Huacun works among the Faroe. Somewhat amazingly, this period of time in the game (275 AD) is actually right in the middle of her lifetime, though she would not have been an active philosopher at this period.Anyway, she’s probably making a prediction that the Faroe’s will win the war against the Sami. Thanks Wei, I could have told you that.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Zheng and Siam make peace, ending this pointless feud. At least Zheng got a great admiral out of it? Getting a great admiral spawns a corresponding great general in his capital thanks to his UA, so really this is a great victory for zheng.</p>"

  scene_title: "The prophecy, part 2"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene18.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Wei’s prophecy comes true… but it’s undercut by the fact that the Faroes are razing the city for no reason. Perhaps they will succeed in burning it, and some random civ will settle there. Speaking of randomly settled Scandinavian cities, Arras comes under fire from the Sami, and they may retake it, as well.</p>"

- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "This city probably should have never existed"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene20.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of indefensible cities that people predicted would fall long ago, Osage takes the Seneca city Kanawa-18s. However, the city is so low health that it might flip once again. In the long run, there are so many Osage spearmen that it should stay an Osage city barring any silly peace deals.</p>"

  scene_title: "This part of the map makes me sad"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene21.jpeg
  narration: "<p>In the part of the map which reminds everyone of the meaninglessness of life, eSwatini and Rosvi battle it out. There are no victors here.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Madagascar movie reference"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene22.jpeg
  narration: "<p>eSwatini looks to settle a third city on Madagascar. Perhaps a new core on Madagascar could bring hope to these dreadful wastes. Or, more likely, Mogadishu will just take these cities. The Qarmatians look like they wanted to settle where eSwatini is now. That would have been funny. Instead they’ll have to settle for one of the outlying islands, or perhaps journey back home. Shoutout to the Vijayanagara city north of Madagascar. Really keeping the Indian ocean migrations alive.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Kazakhs are beaten and battered. Taraz is on no health and destined to fall any minute now. Half their farms are pillaged. They’ve fought some great battles, but the engine on the war machine is dying out.Come on Bukhara, go back in! Retake Herat!</p>"

  scene_title: "Borneo-Again Christians"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Remember how i said nothing was happening here? I was wrong. Singapore advances land and sea forces on Borneo, surround T-bok. It doesn’t look good for the city, but take note of the city defense strength. I’ve been sure to note cities with low strength earlier in the episode, and this is absolutely not the case here. T-bok has 27 strength, nearly three times that of triremes, and roughly 2.5 times as strong as the composite bowmen which beset the city. The swordsmen which stand adjacent to the city are only half as strong as it. The jungles and hills of Borneo make assaulting it with ranged units difficult. This city is a force to be reckoned with. Doukas should count his blessings that he is holding the city instead of trying to siege it.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The terrain makes the Pueblo-Mexican war a total stalemate. Both these civs are quite strong, and they may not break each other until the very late game, even if Pueblo has a roman general on their side.</p>"
- scene_number: 26
  scene_title: "A bit messy"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene26.jpeg
  narration: "<p>While Pontus stands to lose a city in the north to the Qarmatians, Eupatoria sits at 0 health. A cheeky horseman could easily snipe the city and set the Qarmatian assault back significantly.However, Pontus also is in danger of losing Trapezoid. The nature of the city’s one tile harbor will make the assault difficult for Saba.</p><p></p>"

  scene_title: "More indian ocean troubles for Harappa"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene27.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Harappa has one of the strongest cores in the region, but they continue to suffer losses at the periphery. They’ve already lost their Arabian peninsula city, and now their relatively recent city of Mehrgarh is under heavy fire. They might find it difficult to retake if they lose it, given they are also fighting on land in the east, and they have no navy of their own to contest the waters.</p>"

  scene_title: "Things i said would happen"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene28.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of things i said would happen, Seneca retakes their city with a couple triremes. They’ve decided to change the name to Kanawagas.And unfortunately for Osage fans, this is when Osage inexplicably decided to make peace. This is what we in the England fandom call “pulling a Burgundy.”</p>"

  scene_title: "Taino is so cool."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene31.jpeg
  narration: "<p>I’m pretty sure this screenshot is mainly here to show how lovely Taino is this time of year. The fact that the Taino have the same number of cities in this shot as Mexico is really quite embarrasing, however. Many people have been arguing that Mexico, despite its strength, is doomed, suffering from Blackfoot syndrome. But this shot shows their potential is not yet exhausted. If left alone, these cities could grow into a core to rival metal gear.</p>"

  narration: "<p>At some point, the faroes decided to stop razing the former Sami city, possibly out of pity, jeez. (please laugh) Arras is retaken by the Sami, though the size of the Faroe navy makes me suspect this won’t last.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "I remember this war"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene33.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Remember way back in the day when Bukhara settled a city on the frontline of a war. Well, they suffered no consequences for that and the war has finally ended. Unfortunately for both sides, these cities will probably suck for a long time. Eventually, they may become production powerhouses, but right now there is just too little food nearby. </p>"

  scene_title: "Poor Kazakhs"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene34.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Taraz finally falls to Kazan. There is hardly any Kazan fighters left to hold the city, but there is also hardly any Kazakh units left to retake it. This may hold in a sad status quo.Kazan is nearly as war-torn as the Kazakhs at this point, and the Kalmyks may retake Samara from them.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene35.jpeg
  narration: "<p>After a recent golden age vaulted Saba-dmt’s stats, this situation looks very precarious for Mogadishu. However, they do have quite the overseas empire. The terrain favors the defensive for Mogadishu if, nay when, Saba declares war on them. I wouldn’t write off Mogadishu yet, but they walk a very difficult path.</p>"
- scene_number: 36
  scene_title: "I’m so good"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene36.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As I mentioned earlier, a swordsman can really wreak havoc on a low defense city. Just a single Sierra Leone swordsman and a trireme was enough to take Tangier off of the alouettes' hands. If the nearby spearman falls, it may stay in Sierra Leone’s hands for the rest of the war. Also in this shot, the Visigoths try to assault Waterloo.</p>"

  scene_title: "Eek-o, eek-o"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene37.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Hons-17! seems doomed to fall to the Nivkh. The Nivkh aren’t that strong based on the statsheet, but stats nerds can shove it. Stat nerds dont understand grit, heart, clutch, momentum, and wanting it more. That’s why the Nivkh stay winning and stats nerds stay in lockers. Ikko-Ikko should have wanted it more.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode10-scene38.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Mehgahr didn’t go well for the Vijayanagara, but they’ll give Harappa’s southern cities a try as well. They might pull it off, but a 14 strength city is probably a bit too much for three damaged triremes to take. </p><p></p><p>This front may seem irrelevant to some, but these periphery cities are central to Harappa’s potential success. Without them, Harappa has almost no naval potential, and they are forced to fight their greatest rival entirely on land. For Vijayanagara, these cities trap them in and limit their potential. This is a critical front, and they would be wise to commit more resources to it while the cities are essentially defenseless. I wouldn’t want to try attacking these once they are twenty pop and every land tile on Sri Lanka has a Harappan ranged unit filling the space. </p>"

  narration: "<p>I was very optimistic about Bora-Bora’s potential early on. But their Patagonian cities are now completely cut off from the west coast of South America. There’s still hope here, but I’d really like to see them start to fill out polynesia more. That might give them a chance to eventually fight in Chile and reconnect their empire. Then I might start being optimistic again.</p>"

Please fill in the devastation with your imagination.This does open up a city spot in Europe. Who will fill the void? Perhaps that English settler that has sat in the north sea for 200 years? </p>"

Elsewhere on the cylinder, you might see civs with lots of empty space in their borders. Not here.  The Thule enclave is the only exception, and its a juicy prize that both the Crow and the Yellowknives are eyeing, even if one of them gave it away earlier.</p>"

Wait, what do you mean the only interesting thing in this shot isn’t on screen?Oh ffs, I confused the Shawnee and the Bukhara civ icons. Yeah, this might be bad for Bukhara. I don’t think the Dzungars can really threaten them due to the terrain and high numbers of mounted units, but they might make a big distraction from the massive threat of the Afsharids. Hold on tight Bukhara fans, this does not look good.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Well, now that I spent half of last slide explaining what happened in this slide because I couldn’t read civ icons, I’ve got very little to say here. That Kazan swordsman could be a big problem for the Kalymks. A low health, low strength city is prime prey for a swordsman flip. If they lose their only melee unit when it does flip, that’s some tough luck.</p>"

They’re built different.They got that xDAWG in em. That’s why they’re sending their forces against Yamashita and continuing the attack.

Where did any of these settlers go, because they aren’t in the shot. Unless that Qarmatian settler in the far north… turned around for some reason? I do think this shot illustrates Mogadishu’s potential though. The Qarmatians are just trying to do what they should be doing.

I would not be shocked to see eSwatini snipe Safwan. However, I also wouldn’t be surprised to have the attack fizzle out thanks to the Ndongo war.</p>"

Seneca fans, and maybe CBR fans in general, might be tempted to disregard this fight. After all, this city is a periphery, indefensible city. But as long as this city is in Seneca hands, Osage would be forced to divide its attention in a Seneca-Osage war. That could provide an opportunity for Seneca success in a future war.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Ok, let’s put a pin in the Caspian naval war for a sec. The important thing here is the Kazan-Kalmyks war. As I predicted earlier, that Kazan swordsman caused havoc and retook Samara for Kazan. At the same time, the Kazakhs reclaimed Taraz from Kazan. And somehow, in the midst of these two flips, Kazan has mounted a serious offensive on the Kalmyk capital, bringing it to half health. Now what should we make of this? The Kalmyks are pretty light on units,  so I could definitely see Astrakhan falling to a Kazan assault. However, Samara is on 0 health with a melee unit next to it. Flipping Samara would force Kazan to split their forces again, and splitting forces is a death knell for the AI. </p><p></p><p>Moving on to the CASPIAN NAVAL WAR, I think Eusta will hold. At the same time as the Afsharid naval assault, Bukhara has brought Tehran to the red. This would be a great prize for battered Bukhara. Whether or not they keep that prize would be dependent on how much the Afsharids deplete their naval forces in the attack on Eusta- Bukhara probably can’t win a flipfest.</p>"
