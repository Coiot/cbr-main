However, a war with the Dzungars would cost them their northernmost city, cutting them off from fruitful advances up North. From there, the Khoshuts would develop an overwhelming, and debilitating, need to give away cities in peace deals, first giving away their core city of Lhasa to the Dzungars, and later giving away Shigatse to Siam, creating an empire that was, in both physical shape and competence, lobotomized. </p><p></p><p>After a long period of contemplation, however, the Khoshuts, for lack of a better term, locked in. They would be the biggest winners from the Harappan coalition, netting four cities, including their capital. From there they would reclaim what was once lost, retaking Lhasa from the stagnating Dzungars, and Shigatse (as well as Nakhon Ratchasima as a treat) during the Siamese fall. From there, it seemed as if the Khoshuts could become a dark horse. That was until Nader Shah realized his potential (and the power of flight), and no matter how great your XDawg stat, it can’t shoot down a bomber.
