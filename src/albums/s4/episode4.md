  narration: "<p>Hello everyone, and welcome back to the Civ Battle Royale X Season 4, featuring episode 4. Your narrator for today is BV (anarcho-balkan on reddit), for the 5th time. Considering my tendency to write long narrations, I think it’d behoove me to keep these first few slides short and save my long-ass sentences for the action, so let’s get a move-on. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The other OC of the week is the 3rd episode of the comic series “Pacific Pals” by next week’s narrator, Orange (Orangchrisy on reddit), showing us the state of the Pacific Ocean and its rim. Bora-Bora is off to South America, Palawa and Wahgi continue their settling spree, while Shang is fighting wars, leaving Ikko-Ikki rather unenthused. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Into the action we go! </p><p></p><p>And our first action slide features a stupid peace deal... God dammit Leovigild. You don’t even border Bavaria, and your troops were closer to Ludwig’s cities than his were to yours. Why give Asturica away? *sigh* AI gonna AI. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere on this slide, we see the Roman navy approaching Narbo. Last episode, despite what the narrators said, and despite the one-tile naval approach, I maybe would’ve actually given them middling chances of capturing and holding the city provided they could properly reinforce it, as the city’s only defence at the time was a lone archer, while Rome was bringing both ships and embarked land troops. Although this is still the case, it doesn’t seem like it’d stay so for long, as archers and warriors are returning from beyond the Pyrenees to bolster the defenses. </p>"

  narration: "<p>After their initial successes against the Shawnee, the Osage found themselves in a tough two-front war. From the west, the Pueblo are advancing. Their invading force had thinned out from last we’ve seen it, but Mo-he-ag-gra seems set to fall nonetheless. </p><p></p><p>From the east, a combined force of the remaining Shawnee defenders and Seneca and Floridian reinforcements are pushing the Osage attack back, saving Prophetstown (well... the Floridians not so much, they’re yet to reach the frontlines, but the intent is there). </p><p></p><p>With their tail between their legs, the Osage choose to at least reduce the number of enemies they have to deal with, making peace with the Shawnee and getting to keep Chillicothe. It remains uncertain whether they’ll get to keep it, as a Seneca army is approaching its borders, with two archers the only defense. In fact, most of the Osage army seems concentrated around their capital. A strategic reserve to apply when and where most needed? Or a holding force to stop the Pueblo, Seneca and Floridas from getting any ideas? Or maybe even a cynical, perhaps even defeatist, resignation to the inevitable loss of at least one, maybe both of their outlying cities? We shall see. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Last season, the testruns promised us some shitposty borders from Kilwa and Egypt, and yet the official run... kinda disappointed us on that one. This season, we may actually see a promise of the sort fulfilled by the Alaouites and Sierra Leone. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of, it seems both civs have decided to act as allies in a common cause instead of waging war for each other’s distant outposts. Both of them DOW’d Rome, presumably to boost diplomacy with each other and the Visigoths. </p><p></p><p>And speaking of the Visigoths, a large Roman fleet has anchored itself outside of Narbo, and the sole warrior to join the expedition has disembarked. Narbo is beginning to suffer damage, but I’m not too enthusiastic about Trajan’s prospects here. In fact, with the incoming 3 archers and 2 warriors, the Roman warrior may have signed up for a suicide mission. </p><p></p><p>More irrelevantly, the Alaouites also DOW’d the Rozvi, because why not at this point. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Pueblo capture Mo-he-ag-gra. The city isn’t really all that secure just yet - one barely damaged spearman is nearby, but it is also direly outnumbered by the Pueblos’ technologically inferior invasion force. I’d give the edge to Pueblo here, but nothing’s set in stone, especially if Pawhuska decided to engage some of his reserves. </p><p></p><p>On the eastern front, the Seneca and Floridians have barely moved. Only a Seneca vanguard of two warriors had crossed the Ohio river, but unless the units behind them make a move too, I can’t see that taking Chillicothe. Heck, one of those warriors is near dead already. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The long-standing peace in southeast Asia finally ends, as Koxinga declares war on Tran Thanh Tong. Dai Viet had just settled Thanh Dong near IRL Vientiane, so I would’ve understood a Siam DOW more likely, but apparently not. Oh well. </p><p></p><p>Of the two civs now at war, Koxinga certainly has the military edge here. The frontline units alone outnumber the entire warrior-archer garrison of Thang Long. The difficult part will be navigating the terrain, as two rivers, a small mountain range, jungles and marshlands all permeate the terrain between Zheng and the Viet capital. Making things even more advantageous to our defenders here is the random Harappan scout, occupying one of the tiles between the mountains and the Gulf of Tonkin. Still, if Zheng commits to this invasion, they will probably overpower the Viets. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Shang, having secured Old Sarai last episode, doesn’t seem satiated, and is trying to fight its way north. However, the bulk of Shang forces is back in their territory, and the forces in Old Sarai are... rather small in number. With just two yue axemen and 2 archers, one of which seems more focused on garrisoning the city rather than contributing to the advance anyway, I don’t see Shang breaking through to either Beshbalik or Karakorum anytime soon. If I was Daji, I’d send the forces around Nanbo as either reinforcements or a second prong - striking from the southeast while the Mongolians are preoccupied by the forces attacking from the south. I have a hunch that won’t happen though. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, Bukhara has entered the classical era</p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we see the southern half of Australia, with the many cities of the Palawa and Noongar. I don’t really see much happening on this slide tbh. It seems that the Wahgi and Bora-Bora have come to pay a visit to these two civs. Also, nearby the Palawa capital of Mutawaynatji, we see a great general, Gertrudis Bocanegra. </p><p></p><p>In our history, Gertrudis Bocanegra was a hero of the Mexican War of Independence. When the war began, she and her family were quick to join the insurgents. When rebel leader Miguel Hidalgo passed through what is now the city of Morelia in the state of Michoacán in October 1810, Bocanegra’s husband and eldest son joined him. Just 4 months later, they would both die fighting the Spaniards at the battle of Calderón Bridge. From then on, Bocanegra served as an important messenger between insurgent guerrillas active in the areas around the Michoacán cities of Pátzcuaro and Tacámbaro. In 1817, she was sent to the former to help the local rebels capture the city. However, she was betrayed and sent into Spanish custody. Tortured for information, she refused to budge, and she and another rebel captured by the Spanish were executed by firing squad on 11th October 1817, at 52 years old. </p>"

I guess of note here are the I believe new settles of Pajchri (Tiwanaku) and São Cristóvão (New Holland), the random Tehuelche scouts up north, New Hollander and Riograndense settlers that are trekking out, and more Bora-Boran workers coming to develop their Pampas colonies. </p><p></p><p>Also, pronunciation note: Pajchri - j = h ; ch = the English ch, not the German ch.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode4-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Seneca and Floridians have moved, but so have the Osage. Fighting along the Ohio and Illinois rivers is going between the forces at Chillicothe and incoming Seneca units. All sides’ armies seem more sparse than last time we’ve seen them. Nearby Fernandina meanwhile, Florida just got its first great general, Alexandros Papagos. </p><p></p><p>In our history, Papagos was a 20th century Greek general and later politician. His baptism of fire happened during the First Balkan War. Notably, he participated in the war’s final battle at Bizani. He also saw fighting in the Second Balkan War and the War of Turkish Independence. He’s perhaps most notable for his role in World War 2, where he was the commander-in-chief of the Greek Armed Forces during the Italo-Greek War and the Battle of Greece. His service would be put on hold after that, as he remained under de facto house arrest in occupied Greece, until 1943, when he and other officers founded the Military Hierarchy resistance organization, only for him to be captured by the Germans in July. He would spend the rest of the war in Germany in concentration camps, including the infamous Dachau, before the SS transferred him to Tyrol in April 1945, where he was freed by the Americans on 5th May. He returned to Greece later that month, and remained in semi-retirement for the next 4 years, before being appointed commander-in-chief of the Greek Armed Forces once again, ending the Greek Civil War (though, that was already on its way to ending before his appointment), notably employing the air force and veterans of the WW2 North Africa campaign to root out the last communist remnants at the Albanian border. Two years later, in 1951, he retired from the army, being the only Greek officer to ever reach the rank of field marshal. He went on to start a political career, founding the right-wing Greek Rally party and winning next year’s parliamentary elections, becoming prime minister, a post he held until he died of a lung hemorrhage on 4th October 1955. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Here we have come, I presume, to see the beliefs of Vajrayana. We’re already familiar with the Kalmyks’ God of War pantheon belief that predated the creation of Vajrayana, but here we also see the two new beliefs of the Kalmyks. The founder belief seems almost antithetical to their pantheon belief - Peace Loving. It is still a useful belief though, adding +1 happiness civ-wide for every 8 followers of the religion. A follower belief is also added here, Liturgical Drama, which allows them to purchase monuments, amphitheaters, opera houses and other cultural buildings using faith. </p>"

This just looks to me like Ludwig gifting Asturica to Charles, but if he plays his cards right, he could make up for it with Beaune. Appointed by Charles to hold the line is Kittur Chennamma. </p><p></p><p>Kittur Chennamma is a great general whose IRL history I’ve actually already recounted once, last season. But, in case you need a refresher, she was a queen from the modern-day Indian state of Karnataka who fought two wars with the British in the 1820s, actually finding some success in the first war, before being captured in the second war, eventually dying, likely of disease, five years after her imprisonment. </p>"

  narration: "<p>In what’s probably the first relevant North American war to not involve the Osage, the Yellowknives declare on the Crow. The situation is, I dare say, a mixed bag. The Yellowknife mainforce is descending on an undefended Báhkisee, which is near certain to fall. However, outside of this mainforce, the Yellowknives don’t have much of an army. Should the Crow endeavour to cross the Rockies, they’d only be met with a weakly-defended Kwe Ka Tszoa and an undefended Weledeh-Cheh. However, even with that, if I was Joe Medicine Crow, I’d still focus a majority of my army into, if not defending Báhkisee, then at least preventing the Yellowknives from heading even further south from there, balancing the need for that with smaller contingents ranging beyond the mountains. </p>"

  narration: "<p>On this slide, we have a highlight of the Ume-Sámi UU, the Nåjjde, a replacement for the great merchant that, when expended, provides extra gold and faith from lakes and mountains, and customs houses built by them provide extra food and faith. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, we have some rather out of place visitors here. Last episode featured the narrators making note of the Mongolian scout, now trekking towards the Arctic, but Nope and Siege completely neglected the slightly less but still very out of place Selkup scout that came after it. The Selkup scout is now on the Kola peninsula beyond Kalliomaki. Joining them here is a Harappan scout, who has just now met an Ume-Sámi counterpart outside the Finnic capital of Kirmukarmun. I wonder if the two are hoping to organize a scoutcon, starting with those two derps up north. If they are, then I think they’re probably in the wrong place - historically, in Civ Battle Royale iterations, if there ever were scoutcons, they happened in Siberia, not Fennoscandia. </p>"

At least they got a new great general. </p><p></p><p>IRL, Samori Touré was a Maliki Sunni cleric from the Mandinka people. He would enter the service of Omar Saidou Tall as a cleric and general, though when he did so and how much he contributed to Omar’s Toucouleur Empire’s expansion is unknown. What is known is that after Omar died in 1864, his empire entered a period of decline and division between his sons, generals and local leaders. Samori became the leader of a warband, which he used to conquer a number of villages and towns, eventually expanding his realm enough to proclaim what is today called the Wassoulou Empire in 1878. Only 4 years later, his first conflict with the French began, and the two empires would be going back and forth between war and peace for the next 15 years, with Samori even managing several victories and winning his first war against the French. Samori also had friendly relations with the British, who were kind of using him as a proxy to slow down French expansion in West Africa, and thus supplying him with modern weapons. At the height of his power, Samori’s empire stretched from the northernmost tip of modern Sierra Leone all the way to the Volta river in modern Ghana. However, just two years later, in 1898, he was captured by the French and his empire immediately collapsed, most but not all of it falling to them. Samori himself would die in captivity in Gabon in 1900. His great-grandson, however, would go on to become the first president of the modern nation of Guinea, and, ironically enough, one of the biggest names in African Socialism - Ahmed Sékou Touré. </p>"

Thankless bitches, as a Visigothic warrior had even joined them in England’s own war with Burgundy last episode. </p><p></p><p>The main English goal may actually lie in Iberia too, though, as 6 triremes were sent, presumably to attack Emerita and/or Barcino. Without land units, Emerita will be harder to capture than Barcino, and both would be equally as difficult to hold. </p><p></p><p>Elsewhere, unsurprisingly, the Burgundians are easily knocking down the defences of Asturica.

As soon as she ascended the throne in 1576, at 43 years old, she ordered her people to resharpen their weapons. From there, she raised an army of 20000 infantry and 1000 cavalry, and waged a 34-year-long campaign of conquest against her neighbours, conquering lands as far away as Kwararafa and Nupe. She died under unknown circumstances in 1610, with most sources putting her place of death at present-day Idah, in southeastern Nigeria. (Note that my division of Nigeria into southeast, southwest and north mostly follows the Niger and Benue rivers). </p><p></p><p>To the edge of the screen, the Yellowknives increase pressure on Báhkisee, starting to deal damage to the undefended city.

This weakened them enough that when Ndongo came by knocking, they lost Khami, while a now neutral Eswatini’s settles further boxed Rozvi in. Now, the empire which IRL created the heavy militarization of early-modern-to-colonial-era southern Africa sits sandwiched between a recovering formerly vanquished opponent and the new top dog of the region. </p><p></p><p>Eswatini, for its part is rebuilding its army, which I believe is actually stronger than Rozvi’s now, and are sending a settler towards the Cape rn. </p><p></p><p>Ndongo’s army had become more sparse following the war with Rozvi, but they have large enough of an empire to form a stronger production base than their two regional rivals, so in the long run, I can see them dominating. </p><p></p><p>Also, I won’t force the audio-narrator to do it, since I myself struggle with it, but I really like challenging myself to pronounce the sub-Saharan African city names with the pre-nasalization thing I learned from a NativLang video a few years ago. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Oh shit! Someone ping NopeCopter rn! Mag just declared on Wah, and Kuno is immediately coming under pressure from the Danao trireme fleet. Overambitious pirate parties are ranging as far as the isle of Papua itself. I really hope my hype for this war is warranted. </p>"

  narration: "<p>In a sign of solidarity with Muhammad Shaybani, Nader Shah also declares war on Kazan. This is almost entirely symbolic, as there’s a Kalmyk Khanate in the way, but still. The Afsharid army isn’t big enough to cover the entirety of the empire, but it does look pretty strong still. The Iranians even have a settler going out west to secure their border there. They also already settled Tabriz in Balochistan, extending their border with Harappa. </p>"

  narration: "<p>The Selkups also pile on the irrelevant Kazan DOWs, but our main action here is the continuing slogging match for Báhkisee, where... very little progress is going on. The Yellowknives are certainly not getting the fight to Baaxawuaashé anytime soon. On the contrary, a Crow scout has brought the war to Dettah! How’d he get there? If at the beginning of the episode you told me that this episode would involve one of the Crow or the Yellowknives sending a single unit suicidally fighting at the doorstep of the others’ capital, I would’ve assumed it would be the Yellowknives who did that, given the distances involved. But no. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Here, we see the war and peace map. The only civs currently at peace are the Faroe Islands, the Ume Sámi, Makhnovia, Kanem-Bornu, the Dzungars, Harappa, the Khoshuts, Vijayanagara, the Nivkh, the Ikko-Ikki, the Zheng, Dai Viet, Siam, Singapore, the Noongar, the Palawa, New Holland and the Tehuelche. Huh... I guess the reason the Afsharids and Harappa weren’t committing to the war in a previous slide was because they weren’t at war... Why were those Afsharids units damaged then? Whatever. Over two thirds of all civs are at war right now. Most of those wars are irrelevant though. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Another nice shot of Ndongo, showing the continuing settlement program, the trade with Saba-D’mt, the unsurprisingly still uneventful war with Mogadishu, and general Winfield Scott. </p><p></p><p>IRL, Winfield Scott was a general of the US army, starting his career in an 1807 peacetime skirmish between two ships, one American, the other British, and then the subsequent 1812-1815 war. He also played a part in the USA’s story of Indian Removal, including being one of the officers in charge of the Trail of Tears and a commander in both the Black Hawk and Second Seminole wars. He also participated in the war against Mexico, helped prevent the so-called Pig War from escalating into a full scale war between Britain and America, until eventually retiring during the first year of the American Civil War (though he is credited with coming up with what became known as the Anaconda Plan, which effectively choked the Confederate economy). </p>"

  narration: "<p>Shang has rebuffed the Goguryeo amphibious invasion of Yanshi, and has restarted an offensive against Mongolia. Unfortunately, Daji did the classic AI mistake of splitting her attention on multiple target cities, preventing her from capturing Old Sarai. If it’s any consolation, she had just settled Dawenkou... Also I think this is the first time we see Machang?</p>"

  narration: "<p>For our final slide, we have a nice view of the Khoshut Khanate, and with it a look at their new general, Nguyen Hue, near Lhasa. </p><p></p><p>In our history, Hue was one of the three Tay Son brothers that rebelled in the late 18th century against the rule of the Trinh and Nguyen lords, who ruled over the northern and southern lands of Vietnam respectively, officially on behalf of the Le dynasty, which had by then been reduced to mere figureheads. Hue and his brothers overthrew the rule of both lord families and deposed the imperial Le dynasty, establishing their own dynasty and taking imperial titles in their respective parts of Vietnam. Hue had by far the most success, taking all of the north and much of the center of Vietnam. In addition to participating in the overthrow of the Nguyen lords and leading the overthrow of the Trinh lords, he also fought off a Siamese-led coalition in the south, and campaigned in the north, ending the Le dynasty, later claiming the imperial title and the regnal name Quang Trung. He also warred with his own brother, Nguyen Nhac, over control of central Vietnam, and fought off a Qing invasion, before submitting to them to legitimize his dynasty and prevent the Siamese from forming an alliance with the Qing against him. He used his remaining years of rule to pass a series of reforms, mainly concerning the administration, the modernization of the army, and taxation. However, in 1792, just 18 years after he and his brothers rebelled, and just 4 years after he claimed the imperial title, he died, before his reforms could be fully implemented and before he could properly instruct his heirs. This came at a very bad time, as the heir of the Nguyen lords, Nguyen Anh, had defeated Hue’s brother, Nguyen Lu, in 1789, re-establishing Nguyen control over the southernmost part of the country. The Tay Son dynasty would collapse just a decade after Hue’s death, with Nguyen Anh becoming the emperor of the new Nguyen dynasty in 1802. </p><p></p><p>And, that’s all folks.
