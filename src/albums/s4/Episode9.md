  narration: "<p>Hello all and welcome back to the fourth edition of the CBRX. I’m PorkBean and I’ll be narrating through this action-packed episode. The game has just entered year 1 and many empires are making their way towards Medieval Era technology, so we’ll see which cunning leaders can use these new developments to make breakthroughs on their respective fronts.</p>"

  narration: "<p>u/sonicfan0511’s map at the end of Episode 8 shows us the blossoming borders of the cylinder, with much of the map now snapped up by ambitious civs. Expansion by other means will quickly become the only way for our competitors to secure their places in history.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I’m writing this before seeing the PR slides so I’ve no idea who’s top this week, but I’m guessing it’s Rio Grande. Bento Gonçalves has played an utterly dominating game so far and hasn’t even needed to settle more than five cities, win any wars, or build much of an army. Just in case the Faroes hold their position, though, I’d say they’re lucky to be so far from South America and better not set foot in Bento’s turf.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We pick up along the chaotic Burgundian coast, where England has once again prised Norwich out of Charles’s grasp. The European Yanshi remains surrounded by Burgundian troops, however, and without a peace agreement there’s no sign of this flipfest coming to an end anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>In more bad news for Charles, the Faroese fleet has arrived in greater numbers and is hammering the coastal defenses of Amiens. Without a plan to draw at least some of these conflicts to a close, there's little hope of Burgundy coming out in a favourable position - but Charles seems intent on picking even more fights around the globe, expressing his displeasure with Kazakhstan.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And as the notification tells us that Norwich has indeed once again changed hands, we pan over to the end of the Zheng-Dai Viet conflict. Tran has managed to successfully repel each of Koxinga’s advances so successfully that the mighty king has finally decided to call it quits.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Qarmatian units close in on Dioscurias, a horrifying ordeal for the two surviving citizens cowering behind the walls. Mithridates’ army is vast but thinly-spread, and his mounted unit scissors are being expertly countered by the Qarm’s spearman rock. Abu Tahir has also landed a horseman outside the burning Harappan city of Sutkagan-dor, meaning he finally has a chance to put an end to Went-Antu’s Arabian colony.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene09.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Orders from High Priest Kennyo down to the unruly peasants are treated more like guidelines, as the edict “Go and settle northern Honshu” is ignored once again. Hokkaido is a near enough approximation, however, and Yamashina offers a little bit of security to the Ikko-ikki’s far-flung meme-colony in Kamchatka.</p>"

  scene_title: "We’re Gonna Need a Boatier Boat"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene10.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Open warfare erupts in the South East Asian seas, with peace between Zheng and Dai Viet leaving the latter free to set their sights on Maguindanao. The only thing Tran is missing in this epic naval conflict is a navy, like the one quickly engulfing his undefended island city of Thai Nguyen. Given the land/sea disparity between the militaries of these two powers, I foresee a lot of coastal city flips if this becomes a prolonged conflict.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Roman Legions sweep through the city of Mansoura unopposed, all part of the plan to encircle the prize of the Nile - Cairo. The Mamluks are in ruins - no army, no navy, half their cities without Walls and huge regional powers breathing down their neck on all sides. It’ll be a shame to see them go, but mainly because all their neighbours fly purple banners and the colour clash is going to be horrible.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Long a major flashpoint in the eastern hemicylinder, the remaining people of Yanshi enjoy a brief respite as Kennyo pulls out of the War of the Four Kingdoms - leaving the city momentarily in Shang hands. Two Kingdoms remain at arms, however, as Daji desperately marches to recapture the city of Xinxiang from Goguryeo. While the Ikko-ikki might not have left this conflict with any gain in cities, their resultant military buildup on the mainland means that Yoshizaki Gobo should be a secure hold for now.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene13.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The walls of Dioscurias crack. Half its citizens are immediately put to the sword, while the other is left to tremble under the Qarmatian boot. Sutkagan-dor is guaranteed to fall in turn, leaving the only things standing between Abu Tahir and the unification of Arabia are two undefended Pontic cities and a pesky Saba-Dm’t outpost hiding behind some rocks. Mithridates has finally launched a counter-offensive in the north at the city of Bandar-e-bushehr, hoping to use notifications as cover to sack the city undetected.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene14.jpeg
  narration: "<p>And those notifications lead us to the burning city of Aktobe, reeling from its recent conquest by the Selkups. Though it might seem like a waste to throw back such a juicy catch, Vonya is better off getting rid of it and settling along the river himself to trigger his fish-producing UA.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the sidebar notifications reveal a three-way coalition war being declared against Mexico.</p>"

  scene_title: "Mexican Standoff"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene15.jpeg
  narration: "<p>It escapes me what Maximillian did to earn the ire of his co-continentals, but the Pueblo, the Floridas and the Crow have all decided they just Plain Don’t Like Him and team up to take the Mexicans down. The Pueblo army is quite mighty but concentrated along their northern border, which will give Max time to move his own units up to secure his numerous chokepoints. This war will either be a meat grinder, or a pre-ground nothingburger.</p>"

  scene_title: "Norswitch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene16.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Norwich (King Henry V) has been captured by Burgundy!!! I’m not sure how many exclamation points that event merits but three is definitely too many. What does get some !s out of me though is the retreat of the Faroese Armada from what looked like an easy capture. York is also under serious threat from a renewed Burgundian advance, Charles having managed to wheel two catapults within range of the city’s walls. All potential melee units nearby are severely damaged, however, meaning that if Henry can focus his fire strategically the city should remain in English hands.</p><p></p><p>Win or lose, this war will still have devastated Burgundy. Bavaria could blitz across their eastern border virtually whenever they like, and with what little remains of their army Burgundy could do little to resist. They are also still at war with the Visigoths, who are stuck south of the Pyrenees for now but if they ever open up that southern front we could see Burgundy quickly collapsing on all sides.</p>"

  scene_title: "Sierra Leave Me Alone"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene17.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Panning down to West Africa, Sierra Leone’s Saharan holdings in Kenema are reduced to rubble by a very archer-dominated Alouite army. Ismail ibn Sharif has brought four melee units along for the ride, though they are mostly meek and outdated warriors - careful targeting of the nearest military units by Thomas Peters and his composite bowmen could delay the loss of this city despite the desperate circumstances. Once it’s gone, however, it’s gone - Sierra Leone has no melee units of its own in the area either.</p>"

  scene_title: "Norway is Best Way"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene18.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Tróndur í Gøtu executes stage two of his planned unification of Scandinavia: a trireme-heavy invasion of Mother Norway. This puts the cities of Jokkmove, Piteje, Vittangi and Likssjuo in peril as the Ume-Sami have only a measly four ships to Tróndur’s twenty-six in this slide. The Faroese will need land units to push further in, however, especially if they hope to march towards the inland capital.</p><p></p><p>It’s worth mentioning that despite relenting in the blockade of Amiens, the Faroes remain at war with Burgundy and the capture of Arras would be an incredibly trivial side-quest for the fleet if they decide they want an easy beachhead.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "Arrows Across the Atlantic"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene19.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Saba advances on the city of Bornu, hoping to leave Kanem-Bornu as merely Kanem as the war progresses. Idris’s cities can deal passive damage based on their faith output but only if connected to the capital, which it looks like they have mostly failed to do. Ndongo’s conflict with Sierra Leone is ongoing but they are still yet to construct any ships, meaning all the two sides can do for now is take pot shots at each other across the gulf.</p>"
- scene_number: 20
  scene_title: "Got My Eye On You"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene20.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Over in North America we get a shot of the bulk of the Yellowknife army, stationed in the city of Ndilo. These forces would probably be better deployed helping their southern ally Pueblo in the fight against Mexico, but you can never be too careful around the Thule.</p>"

  scene_title: "Great Canadian Garbage Patch"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene21.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Faroese colonization of the Americas is a largely civilian-led expedition, with a truly vast number of unique work boats patrolling the icy waters in search of pilot whales. It will take a war with a competent naval foe to clear out all this flotsam, as these naval workers never obsolete and aren’t consumed when they construct an improvement.</p><p></p><p>Mindful of their new European neighbours, the Seneca send out settlement parties to carve out at least some of the remaining land for themselves.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kazakhstan decides upon a Horde form of government, taking notes from the Selkups currently stomping one of their cities into ash. I count a whole one mounted units among the newly-formed Kazakh Horde, which is really not keeping in the spirit of things.</p><p></p><p>In more urgent news for the Kazakhs, they’re still at war with six civilizations, three of whom are their direct neighbours and one of whom is Kazan, which has just parked their own army right outside the city of Taraz. Once it falls, the path to the Kazakh core will be completely open on all sides.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene23.jpeg
  narration: "<p>The Harappans are booted from the Arabian Peninsula, over which the Qarmatians are tightening their grasp. With pressing issues in the south dealt with, Abu Tahir would be wise to start hauling his units north as quickly as possible to meet the Pontic counteroffensive on Bandar. The Qarmatian army is far superior to Mithridates’ forces, but that won’t matter if they don’t arrive on time.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pax Palawanica"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene24.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Nothing bad ever happens in the lands of the Palawa. Sure, they got bullied a bit that one time by Noongar, but now Noongar is ferociously squabbling with Wahgi over some random city in the Top End. Wahgi themselves are stagnating in a war with Maguindanao. Life is good. All Tarenorerer has to do is wait, build a customs house, settle random islands, and watch as her neighbours desperately try to learn war. You’ll take that top Oceania spot in the PRs yet, champ.</p>"

  scene_title: "Blood Countess"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene25.jpeg
  narration: "<p>With the Pontic European Army consisting of two guys in a field outside Amastris, Elizabeth Bathory commits her forces to attempt a capture of Gaziura. Mithridates’ tech disadvantage is really going to hurt here, and he could be kicked to the other side of the Bosphorus in relatively short order. In typical fashion, however, Royal Hungary has deployed disappointingly few melee units to the front lines, so this could either be an exciting new front or a disappointing dud.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Whatever the Alouites are doing to Sierra Leone, Kanem-Bornu has decided to do to the Alouite city of Salé. Yes, you can overwhelm the city with the might of the archer Spam strategy, but a half-dead horseman is not suitable melee support for a siege.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Sierra Leone, they’re trying to patch things up in their newly captured city of Tétouan. The Visigoth fleet has arrived at Waterloo, however, meeting little resistance. Thomas Peters’s Berber holdings might not hold for very long.</p>"

  scene_title: "Not Really Feeling It"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene27.jpeg
  narration: "<p>In the least committal conflict ever, neither Nivkh nor Goguryeo have really felt the need to do more than pillage a handful of tiles on each other’s border. While Nivkh might look stronger in this shot with its high number of unique units, those are more or less just regular archers with no combat bonuses and a fancy naval unit alternative form. If they want to make any inroads into Korean territory they had better take the opportunity now, while Gwanggaeto’s main force is tangled up further south with Shang.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pontus Pokes Back"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene28.jpeg
  narration: "<p>A setback for the Qarmatians as they fail to reinforce Bandar in time, which falls to Pontus. Burning the city might be a critical mistake by Mithridates, however, as the fire fuels the flame of the last days by supercharging Qarmatian units with infinite movement. The charred ashes of Bandar could just as easily be a springboard for Abu Tahir’s invasion of Anatolia as it could be a morale boost for the Pontic people.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene29.jpeg
  narration: "<p>As ever, bad things are happening in the land of the Palawa. Controlling most of Australia’s iron mines, the Noongar have brought their shiny new swordsmen to the border and launched an incursion near Nipaluna. The Palawan land forces are for the most part only able to field spearmen, however they do have a naval ace up their sleeve with which they could attack Yagan’s coastal cities.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Norswitch Part II"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene30.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Norwich (King Henry V) has been captured by Burgundy!!! Again!! I didn’t even notice it had changed hands before it unchanged hands, but there you are. Burgundy is throwing everything they have at pushing the English out of the continent, with York’s position weakening without naval support. Henry is down to his last trireme, so this grueling conflict might just end in Charles’s favour.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Tarazan"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene31.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Kazan seizes Taraz from Kazakhstan, securing an open-terrain border and road with the core Kazakh city of Almaty. Nazarbayev could really do with a peace deal with someone who isn’t the Qarmatians, or his actually relevant conflicts are going to end with his capitulation.</p>"

  scene_title: "My Island Now"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene32.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Tran Thanh Tong predictably loses the city of Thai Nguyen to the Maguindanaoan fleet, which has secured the island effortlessly with just a token force. Kudarat is much more interested in the Siamese city of Ubon Ratchathani, which King Rama also has no hope of holding on to. Mag has become largely unchallenged on the seas, with no single naval force able to stand up to their prowess. A mainland invasion of Vietnam seems unlikely, however, as Dai Viet now has only one coastal port at Thanh Hoa and it is reasonably well-defended.</p>"
- scene_number: 33
  scene_title: "Tohoku or Not Tohoku"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene33.jpeg
  narration: "<p>While ne’er-do-wells in the seedy gambling halls of the CBR Discord server take bets on who might beat Ikko-ikki to northern Honshu, Kennyo takes the initiative and - surprise! - finally settles it himself. There’s even another settler on the way up, so we might see Japan unified by a Japanese power for the first time in basically forever. Nivkh may be poking around with a couple of exploratory units, but any attempt to squeeze a forward-settle in at this point would be risky at best.</p>"
- scene_number: 34
  scene_title: "By Land Or By Sea, But Never Both"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene34.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Tarenorerer dispatches her navy to assault Pinjarra as Noongar units tiptoe towards Nipaluna. The Noongar have the opposite problem to most militaries on the cylinder, being a mostly melee force supported by very few ranged units. Nipaluna has no walls, so the city is still in jeopardy, but securing its capture could be very coastal for Yagan.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Holiday postcard of the beautiful Bora-bora archipelago. They might be technically at war with some upstart South American power, but you certainly wouldn’t know it from their peaceful home. A small portion of the domestic fleet could be peeling off east towards the Tehuelche city of Koluel Kayke, but it’s difficult to tell.</p>"

  scene_title: "The Anagram Lover’s Kanagawa"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene36.jpeg
  narration: "<p>North America! The Osage Casus Belli of “border contiguousness” is one I will always support, so I welcome their invasion of the disconnected Seneca city of Kanawagas. This cuts the Seneca off from any meaningful participation in the war against Mexico, but that was never going to happen anyway.</p><p></p><p>Osage are also at war with the Floridas, but don’t seem to be paying them any serious attention. Gregor MacGregor might have an advantage with composite bowmen but he has a disadvantage with literally everything else, so he really shouldn’t be trying to draw attention to his little rump empire.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A Faroese sailor sneezes on the way past Arras, accidentally letting loose an arrow and shattering the city’s defenses. “Might as well take it now” figures the captain, rallying a handful of ships for the errand. Piteje is also taking damage and spearmen have begun to set sail from Klaksvik, hopefully to reinforce their new holdings once the triremes are done with them.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As we all know the Zheng Dynasty fled to Taiwan following the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Qing, founding the Kingdom of Tungning and hoping to one day restore the Ming to power from their island fortress. How shocked Koxinga must have been when Qing founder Nurhaci showed up on his shoreline offering his services in their new war against Siam. Civ 5 really knows how to pick them.</p><p></p><p>Nurhaci had better be quick if he hopes to unify Luzon for his new allies, however, as the Maguindanao assault on Siam’s outpost is already almost over.</p>"

  scene_title: "There It Goes"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene39.jpeg
  narration: "<p>And just like that it is over, with Maguindanao seizing and burning the city of Ubon Ratchathani. If they burn it down completely it would clear the way for Zheng’s settler currently hanging out in Anping, which doesn’t seem to have any other plans.</p><p></p><p>This could be the end of Mag’s expansion for the time being, with no secure supply lines to the Siamese mainland and not enough of a balanced force to attempt an amphibious assault on Dai Viet. They remain in a stagnant war with Wahgi, so there could be potential developments there once their navy is freed up.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene40.jpeg
  narration: "<p>New Holland goes to war with the Taino, swiftly encircling the island of Ayiti. This has likely doomed their settler on Hispanola and possibly put their other settlers traveling through the region in serious danger, however if Johan Maurits’s navy can make any significant captures then it may be worth the trade. As another fan of ranged units, Agueybana is going to have a difficult time re-flipping coastal cities if the New Dutch start gaining momentum.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Rome takes Damanhur, isolating Minya and surrounding the city of Cairo. As the weakest civ in the most immediate peril right now,  the Mamluks are looking like a strong candidate for our first elimination of the game. Rome has no other enemies and is well-positioned to take the capital, and I doubt Saba-D’mt will be able to resist mopping up any of the southern cities they miss.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Sierra Leone has managed to win their EU4-style siege race by capturing Salé, while the Alouites still struggle to pierce the last of the defenses in Kenema. The Visigoths are also yet to even scratch Waterloo, possibly fearing the omens of doom that a city with such a name commands. It’s not all good news for Thomas Peters, however, as there is little standing between a predatory Pontic patrol fleet and the open gates of Port Loko.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene43.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Cool as it is for the Alouites to have Apache heavyweight Cochise on their side, he still isn’t a melee unit and still can’t take the city of Kenema. The concentrated fire of five composite bowmen is easily enough to take out that warrior as it attempts to break through from the south, so we’re likely left waiting for those spearmen to hobble into the fray before any progress is made here.</p>"

  scene_title: "War Plan Zheng"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode9-scene44.jpeg
  narration: "<p>Zheng’s war plan against Siam backfires somewhat as even though the latter has lost their city on Luzon, their navy still roams the East China Sea and has settled on Chaozhou as an easy target. Zheng is still at war with Dai Viet and can’t afford to recall their fleet from Anping, so the loss of Okinawa is probably a given here.</p>"

These two cities have been utterly devastated by the war, both down to just one population each. Daji might yet retake them as her unique spearmen are well-positioned to counter Gwanggaeto’s unique horsemen, but is there even anything left worth retaking? Daji needs citizens to execute for luxury resources, after all.</p>"

He’s got problems elsewhere, and the last thing he needs is to have to babysit some random African outpost with only a couple of resources. This was a purely spiteful exercise, to show those Sierra Leonese that they’re not the only ones that don’t know how to prioritize. The Visigoth bombardment of Waterloo has begun. </p>"

Forget what I said about Mamluks, Rio Grande is now in the most immediate danger of being CBRX4’s first elimination.
