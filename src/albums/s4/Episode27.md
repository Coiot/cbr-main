Well, several, but the most important one is that Singapore’s melee naval units are few and far away. The other big problem is that even though this is very funny and embarrassing for Mexico, Mexico has plenty of units to retake the city.

    narration: "<p>Burgundy’s forces continue to dwindle, while the Visigoths fail to assault Asturica for the 596th time this season. What’s worth noting here is that England has skirmishers, the next level of ranged unit in the Enlightenment era mod. This has the potential to be a double-edged sword for Henry. If he upgrades his longbowmen, the skirmishers will have two range. This is a reduction from the longbowman’s increased range, meaning they will have to be in range of a city in order to deal damage. Still, they’re powerful enough to be more useful, and that extra range is still very powerful compared to other civs ranged units of this era.However, if he merely builds skirmishers, rather than upgrading them, they will have just 1 range. Even with the increased ranged strength, it is far more useful to have a longbowman with 3 range than a skirmisher with 1 range. I’d probably have delayed researching this tech if I was England, even if it will also upgrade their musketmen.</p>"

    narration: "<p>The isolated Thule city of Pituffik is repelling an Osage attack. It may seem like this city is an easy capture, but those two frigates in the great lakes are the most powerful ranged units in this screenshot. With 5 different ranged attacks defending the city and Osage units forced to embark to assault the city, this is a nearly impossible nut to crack. It can be done, if enough units are sacrificed to allow cannons to set up; will the AI be able to pull that off?</p>"

    narration: "<p>Vijay declares war on Singapore. Kalibangan is the most obvious target, but it’s also the city with the highest defense and the most defenders. That attack could easily fail. If Vijay instead focuses their efforts on Chantahaburi and Tanjong Pagar, they could secure a foothold against Singapore for future wars. There’s a path to success still for Vijay, even if it’s hard to see. They’re way behind in tech, but this is an era where if you have frigates and privateers, you’re going to have naval parity for a long time.</p>"

    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode27-scene34.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The Ndongo assault on eSwatini begins in earnest, with Big Bend taking damage and a cannon in range. It should be noted the difficulty which the terrain presents here for Ndongo; the discovery of Flintlock means all their main ranged units have just a single unit of range, forcing them to rely more heavily on siege units. The terrain here means that many tiles are unusable for siege units. Near Big Bend, the cannon in the south actually cannot damage the city due to the hill in front of it. With only lancers as melee units in position, it’s possible that the assault still fails, despite a huge tech advantage. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Ecuador continues its invasion of Tiwanaku, and boy does it look bad for Tiwanaku. With multiple cities in range of cannon fire and a plethora of melee units, it is likely only a matter of time before Pariti and Pucara fall. Unfortunately for Bora-Bora fans, it does not appear at the moment that there is a real chance of any Bora-Bora snipes. Still, they should be heartened by the clear tech advantage they have over every other civ in the screenshot, boasting cavalry, riflemen, and field guns. </p>"

It will be interesting to see if Goguryeo can push into Xiaotun and Anyang, but at this point they haven’t shown the initiative yet.

This shot shows an *extremely* dire naval technology gap. Goguryeo has a carpet of naval units 2 eras ahead of Ikko-Ikko.

No one is threatening them here, yet, but with Goguryeo only getting stronger, this could quickly become a problem.Siam doesn’t have to worry about Goguryeo, but the Khoshuts look very strong in the image, boasting a tech advantage over Siam and their UU.</p><p></p><p>The Khoshut UU, a lancer called the Yaso, has an extremely neat little bonus. Like all mounted units, it suffers a -33% city attack penalty. In CBR, with the very limited space to maneuver in most wars, this makes mounted units fairly weak. However, the Yaso inverts the city attack penalty of adjacent units at the start of its turn. That means that any knight or Yaso starting next to a Yaso actually has a +33% bonus to attacking cities. </p>"
