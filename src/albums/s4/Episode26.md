    narration: "<p>Hello there, laddies, lasses and lassoes, and welcome back to another exciting episode of the Civ Battle Royale X Season 4. Your narrator for today is BV, or Boki, whichever you prefer to refer to me by, and by the time I’m writing this slide, I had just received my bachelor’s degree for history just the previous day. Am also planning to relaunch my yt channel soon. Enough about me though. All of you, dear readers, smell absolutely amazing today, and don’t let anyone else, even yourself, tell you otherwise. Anyways, let’s get to the other intro slides before this gets even more… whatever the mood of this slide is. *laughs mostly genuinely, with just a tiny hint of awkwardness*</p>"

In this installment, we focus on Bora-Bora, the best Pacific Island civ we’ve had in any royale thus far. They’re so good, Puni is confident they’ll be able to take on Tiwanaku and Palawa simultaneously. Will he be proven right or wrong this episode?

A substantial Tiwanaku force has come to defend it, but it’s both outnumbered and outteched by the Bora-Borans. </p><p></p><p>Up north, Ecuador appears to be charging ineffectively at Lukurmata and Ojjo. </p><p></p><p>Just like last time, Bora-Bora is the more competent contributor to an anti-Tiwanaku coalition. Who woulda thunk. And, I remind you, Bora-Bora is actively making things harder for themselves by going to war with Palawa simultaneously. And they’re still at an advantage. C’mon Bora-Bora.

    narration: "<p>The Visigoths have weathered the Anglo-Faroese storm last episode, having retaken Reccopolis late in said episode. Currently, a sizable Anglo-Faroese fleet is sailing the coast of Callaecia, while Reccopolis seems mostly secure for the moment. The local Visigothic fleet should not let their guard down tho, there’s some stray Faroese vessels not that far away. </p><p></p><p>The Alaouites, meanwhile, are still reeling from the Kanembu takeover of Marrakech, which, as someone who likes both Kanem-Bornu and Sierra Leone, I have highly mixed feelings about. Like, the pro-KB part of me is like “lol. lmao even.”, while the pro-SL part of me is like “well that was humiliating”. But yeah, a few Sierra Leonean units seem to be preparing an advance on the yet undamaged Meknes. The Alaouites have invested in a wall of crossbowmen and, to a lesser extent, pikemen (half of whom have decided to go swim in the Atlantic instead of holding ground) to defend the capital, and even seem to have paid the Visigoths to send a musketman to block a tile to make any Sierra Leonean approach even more challenging. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Taíno great prophet Vallabha has arrived off the coast of Portucale to spread the good word of Catholicism to this new land. The locals, adherents of Fat Roog, don’t appreciate the gesture. </p><p></p><p>History dropdown</p><p>IRL, Vallabha was a late 15th-early 16th century Indian saint and philosopher who belonged to the Krishna-centered Pushtimarga sect of Vaishnavism active in what are now parts of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He was also a member of the Bhakti movement, which was a reformist Hindu movement that started about a millennium earlier in the southern tip of India and spread slowly northwards throughout the medieval age from there. They believed that adopting a new method of devotion would bring about salvation to all strata of society. They were also some of the least casteist movements in Hinduism of the time. It’s believed that the Hindu Bhakti movement, along with Islamic Sufi orders, played a role in influencing early Sikhism too. </p><p>End of history dropdown</p>"

Eastern Iceland is still home to a cuirassier revolt. In nearby Norđragøta, Canaletto is painting the local cityscape, but in the background loom pillars of smoke, a testament to the revolt’s damage on the local countryside’s infrastructure. </p><p></p><p>History dropdown</p><p>IRL, Canaletto was an 18th century Venetian painter, who usually painted vedute, or cityscapes, but occasionally also painted capricci, or imaginary works.

    narration: "<p>Over in Upper Asia, chaos reigns. Shang had just retook Old Sarai, and a squadron of knights had rode as far away as the gates of Karakorum itself. Their pikemen comrades are currently engaged in a clash with a nearby force of Mongolian musketmen, and are having the worse of it. Overall, it seems Shang retains the initiative on this front, but it is an unstable one. Mongolia has the better tech here, and it’s only through sheer force of numbers that Shang remains in advantage here. If any of Shang’s neighbours declared on Daji now, then worst case scenario for Mongolia would be that it evens the scales on their front. </p><p></p><p>On the edges of the slide, Mongolia is still desperately trying to hold onto Hsia, but the Selkups seem like they’ve almost brought down the city enough to capture it. I wouldn’t count on them keeping it though. The Mongols have a high concentration of units in the north, and the Dzungars near Hami and Manas look hungry. </p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Dzungars, their own forces have just started dealing damage to the Selkup city of Al’myak. The city is currently holding well, but if the Dzungars maintain the pressure, the city is as good as theirs - with only an explorer and a settler to defend the city, Al’myak is doomed. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Saba-D’mt DOW’d the Nivkh, giving us an excuse to look at their empire. </p><p></p><p>Less impressive than I would’ve expected tbh. Not a whole lot of units, but those they do have, at least on land, seem mostly up to date. They really gotta upgrade those ships pronto tho. Caravels simply aren’t gonna cut it at this point. </p><p></p><p>To boost morale through religious conviction, great prophet Quanah Parker came to proselytize to a unit of skirmishers. </p><p></p><p>History dropdown</p><p>Quanah Parker was a member of the Kwahadi band of the Comanche in the mid-late 19th and early 20th century, and also the founder of the Native American Church, a syncretic Christian denomination. Because of the peyote cactus’ central position in NAC theology and rituals, it’s also been nicknamed the Peyote Religion or Peyotism, which was featured in the previous CBRX season, founded by, who else, but Quanah’s home people, the Comanche. Peyote contains a psychedelic drug called mescaline, which apparently gives very spiritualistic trips. It’s only allowed in sanctioned ceremonies, though, no recreational use. NAC theology features a bunch of spirits, and one of the most revered spirits is the Peyote Spirit. Members of the NAC disagree over whether the Peyote Spirit is God’s representative to the Native Americans the same way Jesus is God’s representative to the Old World peoples and their diasporas, or if the Peyote Spirit is Jesus Christ himself. Given a quote Quanah Parker himself gave “The white man goes to church and talks about Jesus. The Indian goes to his tent and talks to Jesus.”, I’m inclined to believe that he would probably agree with the latter interpretation of the theology. </p><p>End of history dropdown</p>"

    narration: "<p>Glossing over the irrelevant peace deals the Finns had with Siam and Sierra Leone, we pan back to Upper Asia, where a veritable flood of Dzungar units has descended on southern Selkup territory. Al’myak is completely surrounded, and Dzungar units have crossed lake Balkhash to drive a wedge between Kargasok and the former Kazakhstani capital of Astana. The southernmost part of the front sees a smaller number of Dzungar units coming through, tho, so the advance on Astana and Almaty from that direction is significantly slower. With the Selkups overfocused on Mongolia as they are, there’s not much to defend against the Dzungar tidal wave. </p>"

Palawa should probably be bringing in more reinforcements. Even if these cuirassiers all die in the attempt, they’re doubtlessly gonna soften the approach for upcoming units, and I don’t think Nipaluna can survive more than one attack on this scale without reinforcements. </p><p></p><p>Over north, another Noongar cuirassier is killing himself by means of Laylatiya. </p><p></p><p>Even further north, some Palawan chips in Wahgi waters seem to be engaging in a shooting contest with their Noongar counterparts near Boyagin. </p>"

    narration: "<p>A barely alive lancer marches into the battered Mongol city of Hsia. He’s only gonna die here, but he’s dying for the glory of his homeland, he believes. When asking some of his skirmisher comrades about the general situation at the Hsia front, he’s told the city has almost no health left, but that the Mongols are unable to capture the city due to a combination of terrain difficulties and their own ranged and siege units blocking any melee units from attacking. Even a Mongol lancer and the small Dzungar force at Manas and Hami aren’t an immediate threat, being blocked off by an army of lancers, skewbald riders, skirmishers and lake-embarked line infantry. </p><p></p><p>Further north, a Selkup army of cannons, skirmishers, musketmen and line infantry is entering the gap south of Sanchu and Varz Kara, advancing towards Tiflis. </p><p></p><p>Also, I’m not aware of the Khoshuts being at war with either the Dzungars or the Selkups.

Damaging an enemy unit causes adjacent enemy units to lose 10% of their combat strength for the rest of the turn. It can also move after attacking, and gains +1 movement when near enemy units. </p><p></p><p>Right nextdoor, St. Augustine is being blockaded and presumably bombarded by the Taíno navy. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Over on this slide, we see the Wahgi mostly chilling. Their armed forces seem pretty sparse at the moment, safe for the large concentration around Korn, but don’t let that fool you. They’re currently fielding some of the most advanced units on the cylinder, like that cavalry. Painting the large concentration of units are two great artists, one of them Rose-Adelaide Ducreux.</p><p></p><p>History dropdown</p><p>Rose-Adelaide Ducreux was a late 18th century French painter and musician. Some of her paint works were displayed at the Louvre Salons on 5 separate occasions during the 1790s. As for her musical talents, she was as good a performer as she was a composer. If you go to her Wikipedia page, the first image you see of her is a self-portrait she did of herself posing with one of her harps in 1791. She was also the daughter of Joseph Ducreux, a guy whom, even if you weren’t aware, you have almost certainly seen in memes, as he drew quite unorthodox self-portraits. It’s almost as if he knew that, over two hundred years after his time, internet memes in general and r/TrippingThroughTime in particular would be invented for his self-portraits to live in eternally. </p><p>End of history dropdown</p>"

Unappreciated, even in his native Netherlands, for most of his life, M.C. Escher’s art finally got its first retrospective exhibitions during the very late 60s, when he was 70. He started gaining more appreciation after he died in 1972 throughout the late 20th century, and by the 21st he has become a household name, exhibitions celebrating his work held around the World. </p><p>End of history dropdown</p>"

However, eventually, the Taíno came to finish what they’ve started so many centuries ago. And, in the end, it was them that spelled Florida’s doom. The Floridas are now reduced to an F in the chat.

Originally a king of just Upper Egypt, he defeated his rival in Lower Egypt to unify the land by force, and is often considered as the founder of Ancient Egypt’s 1st dynasty, ushering in Egypt’s Early Dynastic Period. The dating of his reign is rather difficult, with earliest estimates putting him in the late 33rd century BCE, while the latest put him in the early 30th century BCE, but the closest thing to a consensus date is ca. 3150 BCE. He also seems to have maintained an Egyptian presence in southwestern Canaan, unlike any of his predecessors and many of his successors until a long time later. Historians are still in disagreement over whether Narmer and a slightly later pharoah, Menes, are different people, or in fact the same man who changed his name after achieving unification. </p><p>End of history dropdown</p>"
