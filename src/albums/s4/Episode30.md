description: "Yeah you saw that really bad thing that happened the other day? The one with all the people who were mad and bad and angry and sad and weird and just kinda gloomy over it? Yeah, what if that happened to a bunch of tiny little people in a tiny little globe where we watch them partake in geopolitical tragedy of their own bucket of circuits. History once repeats itself as farce after all…"

    narration: "<p>We begin the episode with a bang as Bavaria waltzes into Csjeste, armed with stakes and garlic amongst their guns. The last fortress of the vampire queen, Elizabeth Bathory. The legends say that she sucks blood from the very soul of her people, draining lives and bathing in the blood of virgins. The 15 man regiment of Abraham Van Helsing has been assigned to clean out the Manor of Celtje, the last holdout of the damned queen. </p><p></p><p>They approached through the night, battered and bruised past the gunpowder. Old equipment. The manor smiled at its shaded corners, cobwebs dancing and floorboards twirling. The grand chamber stood by them. Van Helsing gave the sign. The men watched, as she slowly rose, pale, bones poking through skin. She hadn’t fed in a long time. There was no better opportunity. The signal came.  “Charge!” </p><p></p><p>The room was nothing but red. Twelve had given their lives to dispel the beast. Alone, Van Helsing stands, above the puddle of blood that was left behind by the monstrous woman. It seems now her reign has ended. </p><p></p><p>Royal Hungary initially got off to a fairly decent start. The underdogs opted not to go for a third settled city, instead ripping Ingolstadt from the hands of the Bavarians. That, unfortunately, was their peak. Shortly afterwards, they proceeded to spend multiple episodes doing nothing and instead exploiting their UA by forgetting to build food buildings, allowing the capital to grow while everyone else starves. Of course, starvation means less production, science, etc. And this was made even worse by their refusal to use the one thing defining them, their military, for actual conquest. While they would take a city from Pontus and put up decent fights, by the time the midgame rolled around, Bathory had too many warmonger penalties and too backwards of a military. It was then simply too much when the Romans and Bavarians came in. Fade em. </p>"

    narration: "<p>In the foothills of the Andes, Esteban Portes walks with his depleted troop of the 12th cuirassiers. Hardy, pained and tired, he takes a second to admire the hills near their objective of the city of Tiwanaku, the last bastion of their great foe. They are in the red, and all it should take is a concentrated assault to secure the city and breach the walls. Artillery and infantry support is scarce, but with any luck, they should be able to do so. He hears an awful roar. Its the sound of the new experimental landships of the Bora Bora. Motorized and converted from unused boats, it promises impenetrable armor and terrifying speed. Portes sighed. His trusty old horse will have to be good enough. Tomorrow, they strike. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The plains of Tibet show a tale of pain and failure in great beatitudes. Goguryeo forces have conquered Xianxazhou, leaving the city of Dawenhuo as the last bastion of the Shang, And unfortunately for them, its not much of a bastion indeed. The awesome power of air bombardment has left the city in the black, and the residents in desolation as Goguryeo cavalrymen scamper across the plain in sight of the city. With no other recourse, the mad lady has ordered her final will and testament. An early funeral as you will. A hundred courtesans are to be locked in the court, to be subjected to debauchery untold. These poor people’s tales will, for the interest of time, not be relayed, in spite of strong evidence from Goguryeo historians. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We move on to a shot of the Indian ocean, where funnily enough, not one of the civs in the region are Indian. Madagascar is dominated by a melting pot of Mogadishu, Vijayanagar and Eswatini cities and units, with a big Noongar contingent chilling in the middle. All these civs are very solidly mid tier, and all these men have little reason to loiter here. They distract themselves with petty arguments in floating markets, speaking localized Malagasy slang as a lingua franca, as sailors play craps on marooned ships. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We move over onto the Visigoth-Sierra Leone war, where the city of Barcino is burning. It doesn’t look likely that Visigothic troops will relieve the place, and I’m not sure Sierra Leone will be happy enough to wind up ending the razing. To the east, Palencia is also threatened by Sierra Leone units, though right now its all love taps. As Barcino burns, Thomas Peters sits back, drinking some fine Iberian whiskey. It has a smokey feel to it. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We move over to the Khoshut front, where two narratives are forming. On one hand, Khoshut soldiers successfully secure the city of Lhasa, given up to the Dzungars many moons ago, a weaker, more worrisome time. Its recovery has served as a symbol of confirmation - this is an entirely new leadership apparatus. No more throwing, choking and standing around like Tony Snell. Unfortunately, they seem to be doing just that in Mohenjo Daro. Afsharid troops have ran through the countryside uncontested, wielding haste and cannonry capable of sweeping the Indus valley without immediate reinforcement. While Gushi Khan realize whats happening down south fast enough to prevent conquest? </p>"

The people have been informed that a peacekeeping mission shall occur within Siam for the benefit of the oppressed Singaporean and Vietnamese minority, though everyone doubts anything shall be sent to truly assist Singapore or make gains. Everything about the Faroes says stacked. The science, the production, the military, the positioning. The issue is, to put it in sports/Poblometrics term, they don’t want it. They got no motor. All that power will become dead weight if not applied somewhere. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Dawenhuo falls, a dilapidated ruin of its former self. The bombs, guns and Daji’s debauchery had made good work of that. Goguryeo soldiers walked the impoverished and ancient streets, disgusted by the starvation and atrocities that occurred under Daji’s watch. It smelled of brimstone and incense in the last city of the fox. Generalissimo Manjo promises to the former Shang residents that he shall lead them to new prosperity, away from the wretched influence of that destructive woman. </p><p></p><p>Shang was not expected to do well at all. Daji’s self-destructive nature and the cramped start often meant that she was prone to killing herself very early, or getting steamrolled or outscaled by her neighbours. Incredibly, Daji seemingly defied all expectations in the beginning. She settled through boundless plains to give a strong empire, bulking her military and cities to become an early game juggernaut, surviving coalitions by Zheng, Goguryeo and the Ikko Ikki and even making strong gains against Mongolia. They seemed destined for greatness</p><p></p><p>Then Daji decided to start indiscriminately killing civilians</p><p></p><p>Shangs UA allows for the AI to sacrifice a population to gain a luxury in a city, each use of the UA placing said city under anarchy for an increasing amount of turns. In episode 17, Daji proceeded to spam the UA in all her major cities, condemning her civilization to 55 straight turns of doing nothing. I don’t think any civilization has shot themselves in the stomach this hard. She couldn’t build any buildings, build any units, research any techs due to lack of science output or do, well, anything. Of course, it didn’t take long for the vultures to come pecking. Zheng would seize major cities in the south. Mongolia then came in to swoop back their conquests and secure their borders. Miraculously, Daji managed to pull one last rabbit out of her hat, preventing Goguryeo and the Ikko Ikki from gaining much from their initial assaults and even mounting something of a second renaissance. Unfortunately, Goguryeo then decided that it was about time for them to die, and you simply cannot contest against a civilization 3 eras ahead of you with quintuple your stats. F. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We take a look at the Tarim basin, the heartland of the Dzungar empire. They are well stocked with their cannons, muskets and UU, but none of those are exactly the most advanced if you hope they may escape their bathtub. We also witness Remedios Varo, a notable surrealist painter, as he works his next tapestry. It may well be very influenced by military forces, lining light and moody strokes to canvas in the endless desert. But we shant know till he puts brush to canvas. </p>"

    narration: "<p>We move on over to Harappa, where we get a look at the Afsharids unique musketman, the Jazayerchica. The Jazayerchica costs more, but has extra combat strength and boosts itself and adjacent mounted units by giving them +1 movement and +10% combat strength when adjacent. Though a bit outdated, it is devastating when combined with the heavy cavalry focus of the Afsharid military, as they sweep throughout India. </p>"

Cleaved apart by the authoritarian scum of Pontus, Latvia and Kazan, the people live their daily lives without assistance from nearby communes, simply retaining a strong, self sufficient lifestyle in their isolated town. Nestor Makhno stands silently. This was, after all, how things were to be.  </p>"

He did not ask for the posting for this southwards assault. A cannonball hits the deck. “Sir, from the starboard.” His fine bottle of brandy sat still, undeterred by the chaos from the turbulent seas. A Noongar carrack, similar to his own, popped up by his own ship, its crew yelling and rowdy. He pulled out his pistol. “Prepare for boarding action.” </p>"

    narration: "<p>The walls of Nancy fall to an English cavalryman, ending once in for all the reign of Charles I. A short elegy, as the Burgundian rose is snuffed out. </p><p></p><p>Charles and Burgundy were, once again, not expected to do well. Credit where credit is due, Charles played about as well as he could’ve given the circumstances. He settled up France in unique patterns that made the AI unable to launch concentrated assaults against his nations. He fought valiant defensive wars in the face of consistent three way assaults by England, the Visigoths and Bavaria. He worked his way up the tree as well as he could. Hell, he even scammed Asturias out of the Visigoths, relegating them to mediocrity. Unfortunately, when you spend your entire existence constantly getting assaulted by three (four if you count that one Faroese snipe attempt) powers with much better scaling bases than you, you don’t really have time to scale up yourself. This proved to be their downfall, as England proceeded to build their infamous Longbow swarm and pair them up with some decent melee units and their production-sapping Chevauchee. Combined with the English UA, it didn’t take long for England to obliterate the already weakened Burgundian army and sweep through their lands with ease. Fade em at 49th. </p>"

The Thule have revealed their secret weapons - the skies, and have used their air force to assault Viskvo in spite of even troop technology and count. Of course, they still have to actually walk into the city, a task made harder by the rocky peninsular terrain and the abundance of Nivkh troops. </p>"

Despite Gushi Khan’s promises of change and aggression, the empire looks very similar to how it was at the start of the episode, sans the reclaimed city of Lhasa. If anything, he has demobilized some troops, even in the face of expanding world tensions. What a leader. Meanwhile, we get a snippet of the Siamese-Singaporean war, as Nakon Ratchasama, Siams biggest city, begins to take water from Singaporean assaults. </p>"

It gains extra XP when trained in the capital, concurrent to a third of XP gain from non-capital cities (eg, if you have 4 cities and a barrack in every city they’d gain 15 xp). While it could be a powerful unit in some other hands, I’m not sure these guys were trained in the capital. And I doubt they’ll be enough to swing the tides back against Singaporean assault. </p>"

The lyres and organs were unfortunately not going to be enough to lift his dour mood. And so, the plan got into his head. One night, when Huystus was going back to bed, he saw an unexpected sight.

In fact, do they really need that many ships in the first place? Wouldn’t a bit of a land force prove to be useful for taking and holding inland? I don’t mind though, since sometimes its best to let sleeping dogs lie. </p>"

There are few silver linings aside from knowing that he has not lost the Burmese coast. And the wars not done yet. Reports are there are Goguryeo soldiers in the north, pouncing about ready to strike. The Plight of Rama V may not be over just yet. </p>"

I would give more riveting analysis but I see a really big mountain right ahead of me and time runs thin. Thank you all for reading the episode! Sorry the heavy delay amidst all the uncertainty and strangeness in the world. And just from me to you - You can make it. Even through all thats bad right now, you can overcome the pains and issues, and like the Nivkh, bounce back into stronger form. And thats truly all folks.
