    narration: "<p>One of the big stories in the last episode was the Ecuadorian-Mexican War. It’s only fitting that we begin with the latest news from the front: Ibarra has flipped back into Moreno’s hands, and by the looks of it they might be able to hold on to it for a turn or two. Ecuador is still under threat, but honestly I’d rate their chances to survive this quite high. Let’s see if that prediction holds any water!</p>"

    narration: "<p>The fighting has stopped around London, flames surround the mouth of the Thames river. A great musician composes a mournful sonata for the lost islands: “One day we will go back home”, he says, without an ounce of faith in his voice. Henry is nowhere to be found, having long departed with his generals across the Channel, to try and consolidate the continental holdings against the Faroese fleet. </p><p>And to be fair, who knows what they can do. If Trondur gets that gigantic fleet back from the North Sea, Norwhich and York won’t last long. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Another capital falls: Wahgi’s troops, after maneuvering through burmese mountains, have finally entered Thanh Dong. A few of Rama V’s King’s Guard still stand outside the city gates, ready for a last ditch effort. Can Wahgi push any further, or will they peace out to avoid warmonger penalties? </p>"

    narration: "<p>While Siam despairs, across the Indian Ocean a quieter city capture has happened: the Singaporean armada has taken over Rakhigarhi and Sri Lanka. Kalibangan sits in steady hands and Lee Kuan Yew instructs his troops to ready the attack on Mangalapura. The city seems primed to fall, and will be somewhat easy to hold on to. Then, it’s just a matter of getting land units there, and soon the entire peninsula could flip. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Trumpet in hand, Dizzy Gillespie sees the island of Kaldbak barely emerging over the horizon. He left the Seneca lands to cruise the Atlantic with his Warband escort, and wonders where he could play his next show: the world cares more for war than music. His eagerness and joyful spirit endure, nonetheless, and he turns his sight to the open sea. </p>"

    narration: "<p>The Zheng fleet, massive as ever, patrols the seas, but their core is still bare from any significant land units. In their place, workers, missionaries, general and artists go from city to city. Charles Correa, an engineer, stands amongst them. Sketches and building permits overflow his hands: there is so much to build, so much to adapt to, and yet if Goguryeo comes from the North, not much will stand against them. </p>"

    narration: "<p>A Bora-Bora fleet, led by danish admiral Peter Tordenskiold,  sails in New Holland’s waters. Does this speak to good relations between the two main powers of South America? Or is this the last friendly trip before they come at each other’s throats?</p>"

    scene_title: "Mountains on my mind"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode32-scene18.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Panic erupts in the Himalayas as 4 different powers declare war on the Khoshuts, including three of their direct neighbors, Bukhara, Afsharid, and Dzungars. To be fair, the mountains will keep the Dzungar and the Bukharan at bay for the time being. The Afsharids, however, have flight and do not care for these obstacles called “mountains”. And we know they’ve been building up an imposing cavalry force. And Harappa is quite open. No need to say that this does not bode well for Gushi Khan, especially given his tendency to give away cities in peace deals as a show of good faith, but let’s try to maintain hope for them. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Same cannot be said for poor Leogivild, as Narbo looks ready to fall to Sierra Leone’s troops. Despair has taken over the streets and soldiers flee the fights, as the Visigoths are undeniably outmatched by the West African power. England’s iberian holdings would make a nice easy conquest for Peters, to finish his tremendous march north. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Ishtar’s missions have taken her everywhere. She has met people full of honesty and people full of deceit, brave warriors and cowards, wise leaders and hopeless fools. She would believe she has a good understanding of the human psyche, if not for Mithridates. And yet his plot against the deceased Rio Grande must have a reason, it surely must, even if it doesn’t make sense. </p>"

    scene_title: "Karma strikes back"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode32-scene21.jpeg
    narration: "<p>We get a good look at England’s new base in France. A Bavarian army is on the advance, but they are technologically inferior, so that immediate danger might peter out quickly. More important are the damaged coastal cities of York and Norwich, who are still threatened by the Faroese navy. If - or maybe, when - these fall, England will find itself in poor Burgundy’s situation: trapped between two powers and doomed to die. </p>"

    scene_title: "Get ready for a long one"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode32-scene22.jpeg
    narration: "<p>The attack on Damietta is not going in Saba’s favor. Yes, the city has fallen to the red and a rifleman could take it. But they have all naval presence in the Red Sea, and there will be enough Pontus troops to retake it. Let’s be honest: before going north, Saba should have attacked Kanem-Bornu. Without controlling Damanhur, that siege is probably not going anywhere. </p>"

    scene_title: "Persian Blitzkrieg"
    slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/cbrx-season4-episode32-scene23.jpeg
    narration: "<p>Well, predictably, Harappa has already fallen in the red due to the imposing Afsharid air force. This might turn into a disaster for Gushi Khan, as both Mohenjo Daro and Lothal  would be meagerly defended if Afsharid conquers Harappa. And remember: Nader Shah has increased movement after a war declaration, so this could all go very fast. </p><p>It would be nice for the Afsharids, though: they have not had a lot of expansion opportunities for a few episodes, and this war could give them the advance they need to dominate the region. </p>"

He is tasked with building an environmentally friendly, bioclimatic building for the modern age. </p><p>Singapore’s troops, meanwhile, move west, to India. Their core looks empty, but they have higher quality units than Zheng does, which might deter any war. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Back to the Visigothic front, no need to paint you a picture. This is less a nice battle painting than blood splattered over a canvas, Cy Twombly style. Narbo will fall, and Toledo will probably follow. Then where would Leovigild go?</p>"

    narration: "<p>The nightmare scenario unfolds in England right now: Norwich’s defenses have been reduced to rubble, Amiens is taking chip damage from incoming enemy ships, and Faroese Great War Infantry units have landed near York. At least Bavaria does not seem to have made any progress yet. Ludwig’s performance in this whole war is very disappointing. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Speaking of Bavaria, they make a very uninteresting peace deal with the Khoshut, ending a war both parties had forgotten about. On a more serious note, their invasion party in England conceals the fact that their core is at the present very weak and empty. Both Pontus and Latvia could deal serious damage to Ludwig, who also suffers from quite the technological handicap. </p>"

I feel both Bora-Bora and Wahgi fill that description now: would you have said they would be the first to kill Siam of all people, before going for either Singapore or Zheng? </p>"

There’s a nice Singaporean presence around Vellore and Penukonda, but could they reinforce in time to hold the cities? If they do, will they be capable of reaching Vij’s capital?

In the north, the Dzungars are attacking Tawang, but I don’t think they have enough to achieve anything there. To be honest, Vijayanagara could end their Singapore war and move inland by attacking the very undefended Lothal and Dege. If they don’t, the Afsharids might get there first. </p>"

    narration: "<p>Toledo will fall, Leovigild repeats himself. Toledo will fall. Until it doesn’t. Thomas Peters fears the ire of the other great leaders of the world, and decides to end things there, leaving Visigoths as a rump state but depriving himself of a capital. If anything, he should have focused on Toledo, and not taken Narbo, especially because now any action against England’s cities will be more difficult.Leovigild, to his great despair, gets to rule a few more turns.  </p>"

Sadly, this is all too late, as York has fallen to Trondur’s troops, and the Grindadraps arrive to exploit its seas. Norwich looks like it could be captured next turn, and Amiens is already below half-life. Sadly for all England fans, I don’t think it’ll get any better.</p>"

No sooner than today President Pawhuska revealed his plans against Po’pay and the non-existent Pueblo. It is a crusade against Death itself. And why not?

Nobody can say this wasn’t coming, but looking at the troop distribution it might have been hasty on Bol’im’s part, as there are no naval units concentrated on the front. On the other hand, while Puni’s fleet is massive, his carpet is mainly made of frigates: would that wooden wall stop the technologically superior Wahgi, who sit 14 techs above them?

Meanwhile, on the other side of the continent, near Gujarat, the Singaporean detachment we noticed a few slides earlier is attacking the once-harappan city of Mehrgarh! That one will probably not flip once captured, which is another humiliating blow to Krishnavedara. </p>"

Puni fields a respectable, if outdated, airforce, while Wahgi’s has not yet been transferred to Micronesia. All of this honestly makes me wonder why Bol’im decided to go after Bora-Bora without preparing properly, because it’s looking like more and more of a bad decision. </p>"
