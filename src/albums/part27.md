  narration: "Welcome to the 27th installment of the /r/civ Battle Royale AKA “World
    Cup of Civ modding”!! I‘m your emergency rescue host, the bombastic /u/NeiraiTheForgiven!
    \ \nIn true Canadian fashion I‘d like to start out by saying sorry: Sorry for
    the hasty narration -- I‘m doing this on lunch break at work and so I only have
    2 minutes per slide. Sorry for being biased -- I made a good number of these civs
    and, for me, this is all about who can make the best, most bloodthirsty civs.
    Sorry for the inevitable rants that will take up all the slides.  To tell TPang
    to never, ever let me do this again, join us on /r/civbatteroyale!"

  narration: Once again, a fantastic map lovingly crafted by /u/SylonL and /u/LacsiraxAriscal.
    Some lovely additions this time around including the advent of water borders,
    puppeted territories and power rankings!

  narration: Today‘s battle royale begins with Babylonian drones hovering over the
    Maori capital. It‘s a lovely picturesque morning, but if I was the Maori I‘d be
    quite scared by the dense water-bound carpet of death covering Australia‘s waters.
    If Parkes the Warmonger decides to turn it on the Maori...

  narration: "...As you can see, all these one-tile island cities just look like ripe
    kiwi fruit waiting to be picked by the Grand Wobbegong Armada.  Again, this slide
    shows more and more and more Wobbegongs. It‘s insane how many Privateers Australia
    has at her disposal."
- scene_number: "5"
  scene_title: Image 05
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene05.jpg
  narration: This slide shows my favorite children, the Inuit Ice Walkers, locked
    in battle against the Sleep Walkers of Yakutia. Actually, it shows them looking
    over the mountains at each other. Not much appears to be happening here.
- scene_number: "6"
  scene_title: Image 06
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene06.jpg
  narration: All knees should quiver at the sight of an Australian scout in the middle
    of Asia. After all, where a scout comes, Wobbegong water carpets follow. Also,
    this slide shows the Himalayan Cavalry, a Knight replacement that moves quickly
    on hills and can suck culture straight out of mountain ranges. Likely by posting
    snapshots on Instagram.
- scene_number: "7"
  scene_title: Image 07
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene07.jpg
  narration: "Here we see what‘s left of the Kongo, or 'New Draka' as we call it.
    This slide also shows and incredible amount of pillars of smoke., as the Boer
    Commandoes pillage what‘s left of Northern Africa in their zeal to remove all
    non-Colonialist Legacies civs from Africa.  \nOkay, I‘ll stop."
- scene_number: '08'
  scene_title: Image 08
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene08.jpg
  narration: 'Finally, red numbers fly out of units. Here we see the Ayubbids attempting
    to rush Great Prophets into Carthage as a sort of ''convert or die'' tactic.  The
    question is: do those prophets spread Islam or Judaiism?'
- scene_number: '09'
  scene_title: Image 09
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene09.jpg
  narration: "Just like my lunch break, the Poles and the Germans are running out
    of time. The Swedes and the Spartans are picking up the remains of these once-great
    empires.  \nEmpires? Maybe that‘s a bit too generous."
- scene_number: "10"
  scene_title: Image 10
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene10.jpg
  narration: Almost nothing to see here. The three naval empires who have done the
    least in last while. We do get a peak at an Icelandic Skald, which is a naval
    scout/settler. It‘s not armed, but is a threat to any unsettled land in the world.
    With any luck, we may see a few new Viking expansions.
- scene_number: "11"
  scene_title: Image 11
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene11.jpg
  narration: "Here the Babylonian periscopes reveal what everyone knew already: Portugal‘s
    western naval defense force has been reduced to a few motley vessels and, unless
    the eastern navy comes to her aid, Portugal will soon find herself without any
    port towns. \nIncluding her capital.  \nOh, who are we kidding? If the eastern
    navy descends, it will soon find out what happens when you sail against the Corsair
    fleets."
- scene_number: "12"
  scene_title: Image 12
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene12.jpg
  narration: "I‘m not looking ahead, so I don‘t know if Atilla falls today. I DO know
    that Beaumont will soon be flying Siberian colors. So, grey and gray. \nAlso,
    Finland has finally ended the war of North American aggression. Without fighting."
- scene_number: "13"
  scene_title: Image 13
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene13.jpg
  narration: The only thing to point out here as we see M‘Banza-Kongo switch hands
    again is that the Kongo tactic of bombarding the crap out of her former cities
    is reducing the population of the African west coast into oblivion. At this point,
    it‘s only a matter of time until the cities are reduced to nothing beneath the
    boot of Kruger.
- scene_number: "14"
  scene_title: Image 14
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene14.jpg
  narration: Finland in all her glory. Notice the fairly powerful navy in the Baltic
    Sea, left.
- scene_number: "15"
  scene_title: Image 15
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene15.jpg
  narration: 'A little bit to the west, we gaze in awe at Sweden, the civ I personally
    nominate for ''Biggest Surprise Badasses'' of the CivBR Mk II. Illuminated by
    the Great Arrow In The Sky, we see their UU: A lancer replacement that synergizes
    with Great Generals. Like, you know, the ones all around it.'
- scene_number: "16"
  scene_title: Image 16
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene16.jpg
  narration: In a desperate attempt to save himself, Atilla has made peace with the
    wrong enemy. Stalin was a threat, for sure, but his forces aren‘t camping on Atilla‘s
    doorstep. Also, Beaumont is currently arrayed in two shades of gray.
- scene_number: "17"
  scene_title: Image 17
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene17.jpg
  narration: "Japan -- or what‘s left of it. Meiji Japan trades Bushido (no damage
    reduction from injured troops) for Imperial Reverence (Extra XP, Culture, and
    Gold during Golden Ages,) and I can‘t say that they‘ve benefitted much from it.
    Especially being on the receiving end of both Henry Parkes (Australia) and now
    Darkhan (Yakutia).  \nIsrael is watching, as always."
- scene_number: "18"
  scene_title: Image 18
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene18.jpg
  narration: "Darkhan (Yakutia), shocked by the events of the past week, decides to
    Stand With Paris (for now), declaring a peace treaty. \nIn other news, the Inca
    have declare war on Chile. What are they thinking?  And yes, that is a huge, powerful
    navy. Strangely, Australia‘s land forces seem sparse in comparison. Will the Kimberley
    take the chance and strike? One can only hope."
- scene_number: "19"
  scene_title: Image 19
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene19.jpg
  narration: "Pachacuti (The Inca) floats his navy of old toy boats towards Bernard
    O‘Higgins (Chile) This war will be sadly choked, as only one tile will allow land
    troops through.  \nAdvantage: O‘Higgins -- the one tile passes through his citadels
    and into his Generals."
- scene_number: "20"
  scene_title: Image 20
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene20.jpg
  narration: Surprisingly, Leiria (Portugal) seems to be doing better than when we
    last saw her, which makes no sense. I claim that Portugal has been saved byt the
    barricade of neutral Icelandic, Morrocan, and Snorwegian ships, making it hard
    for the pirates to line up a good shot.
- scene_number: "21"
  scene_title: Image 21
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene21.jpg
  narration: "The dying breaths of the two red-and-black nations of Europe. Poetically
    covered in streams of yellow troops from the North and South, the 'capitals' of
    Germany and Poland are like two bodies in a hexagonical Yin-Yang.  \nIf you squint.
    \ \nOn the far right of this slide, we can see the Armenian UU, the Mamikonian
    General. It increases the siege damage of nearby Mounted units and causes them
    to gain additional gold when they attack a city that follows a non-Jewish religion.
    What‘s more crazy is that the Mamikonian isn‘t a Great General replacement --
    it‘s a Prophet. Clearly, it takes after Samson and Ehud, not some preacher with
    a beard."
- scene_number: "22"
  scene_title: Image 22
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene22.jpg
  narration: "Texas. Mighty Texas. Mighty, savage Texas. Texas is surrounded by nations
    with better technology than Texas, who just entered the Industrial Era. Even Lincoln
    has better guns than Texas.  \nSam Houston had better work fast on getting smarter
    if he doesn‘t want to be humiliated by the two traditionally worst fighters in
    all of North America."
- scene_number: "23"
  scene_title: Image 23
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene23.jpg
  narration: This slide shows my favorite children, Canada, my home and native land.
    True patriot love flows from my heart as I blithely ignore the fact that they
    have also just entered the Industrial Era. Like Texas, while Canada is mighty
    indeed, they‘ve got to get their act together if they don‘t want to be showed
    up by Iceland or the United States, or even worse, my favorite children, the Inuit.
- scene_number: "24"
  scene_title: Image 24
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene24.jpg
  narration: "Hey, it‘s the Zulu! They‘re really only relevant right now because they
    show that Nzinga Mbande (Kongo) has regained not one, but three cities. Soon to
    be two cities!  \nIs it possible that the Boers are losing their grasp on the
    west coast?\nOh yeah, the Zulu. That‘s an impressive number of Impi, the greatest
    UU in the game. Too bad that the Age of the Impi is coming to an end.. soon, they‘ll
    be crushed beneath tank tracks."
- scene_number: "25"
  scene_title: Image 25
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene25.jpg
  narration: It‘s hard to tell from this slide, but the Yakutian Sleep Walker forces
    at the bottom of the slide have slowly, inexorably pushed through Japan‘s meager
    defenses to the north of Hiroshima. In another place, the Ice Walkers have slowly,
    inexorably pushed through Yakutia‘s more significantly powerful defenses around
    Suntar. And Lester B. Pearson, who undoubtedly actually started this war, has
    declared peace.
- scene_number: "26"
  scene_title: Image 26
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene26.jpg
  narration: This slide shows my favorite child, Afghanistan. They‘re beginning the
    first few turns of war with Persia. It‘s anyone‘s guess who is going to win this
    one -- both armies seem sparse and outdated, and Darius (Persia) is probably the
    only civ that borders Afghanistan that has a fee path to their cities.  Except
    the Muggles, and we both know they won‘t be doing anything about it.
- scene_number: "27"
  scene_title: Image 27
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene27.jpg
  narration: 'Finally, at long last, we get a shot of the Muggles! Their UU, the Farsakh
    Cannon, looks amazing and packs a huge punch! It does have a weakness, however:
    it can only move when it‘s at full health. Which means that it is the perfect
    weapon to represent a turtle empire like the Mughals.'
- scene_number: "28"
  scene_title: Image 28
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene28.jpg
  narration: "Poor Hannibal. Alexandria is just out of reach of his navy and his land
    forces don‘t seem to be able to push past the Ayyubid forces -- despite being
    apparently more technologically advanced. \nWhich isn‘t saying much"
- scene_number: "29"
  scene_title: Image 29
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene29.jpg
  narration: Here we see a lot of Finnish Jaakari, cheap mass-produced riflemen who
    gain XP quickly when in friendly territory. But who cares! Vietnam DOWed Burma
    -- let‘s go watch!
- scene_number: "30"
  scene_title: Image 30
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene30.jpg
  narration: The Trung Sisters just declared war on the Burmese. Vietnam has more
    cities, more troops, and obviously more technologies. On the flip side, Vietnam
    has no defenses around Senggezangbo, and the Burmese are looking to take that
    city easily.
- scene_number: "31"
  scene_title: Image 31
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene31.jpg
  narration: A Portugese Man-o-war in a toy boat watches in rapt attention as Kruger
    (the Boers) prepares to conquer the entire Kongo Koast. Nzinga Mbande (Kongo)
    no longer has any cities that aren‘t in the middle of falling to Kruger‘s Kommandoes.  Also,
    having recently been converted to Judaiism, Saladin (The Ayyubids) has begun spamming
    Africa with scouts.
- scene_number: "32"
  scene_title: Image 32
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene32.jpg
  narration: 'This slide settles it: Kamehameha (Hawaii) isn‘t in this game to fight
    wars. He‘s in the game to troll  the other leaders by spamming his neutral units
    into all their wars, gumming up the works and keeping the peace. And he‘s doing
    a better job of it than Pachacuti (Inca) or Bernie (Chile) is doing of fighting
    a war.  Of note: the Chilean navy is quickly resorting to their past-life backdoor
    methods, moving around the Incan toy boat fleet. We‘ll see how this works out.'
- scene_number: "33"
  scene_title: Image 33
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene33.jpg
  narration: I‘d like to pause on this slide to dedicate this CivBR part to my wife‘s
    grandfather, David Enns, who passed away this evening after a lengthy illness.
    May your memory live on, enshrined within our hearts. Be at peace.
- scene_number: "34"
  scene_title: Image 34
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene34.jpg
  narration: Now to finish the job. France and Ireland declare was on what‘s left
    of the English Commonwealth. They shouldn‘t have much trouble pushing Elizabeth
    over the brink into dark waters.
- scene_number: "35"
  scene_title: Image 35
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene35.jpg
  narration: Hawaii, island paradise of Kamehameha (Saiyans), who spends his days
    surfing, drinking, and trolling South American battlefields.  His navy is decent,
    but won‘t stand a chance agaisnt Australia‘s Grand Wobbegong Armada. Hawaii is
    just ripe for the picking.
- scene_number: "36"
  scene_title: Image 36
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene36.jpg
  narration: On this slide we see Gajah Madah (Indonesia), fat, lazy, incompetent
    coward. Today he pretends to be strong by declaring war on Burma, knowing full
    well that the Champa stand between himself and any danger. A shame, too, since
    his navy looks like it could actually do something if Gajah Madah wasn‘t too afraid
    to actually do something.
- scene_number: "37"
  scene_title: Image 37
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene37.jpg
  narration: Darius, glorious lord of Persia, is beset on both sides by attackers.
    Luckily for him, he does not seem to be threatened much by Armenia. More worrisome
    is the carpet of trebuchets and the occasional Death Camel(tm) moving towards
    Susa and Tarsus from Afghanistan.
- scene_number: "38"
  scene_title: Image 38
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene38.jpg
  narration: Vurocconium, the last bastion of Attila the Hun. He roars in defiance
    from atop The Attila‘s Court (his personal pimped-out trebuchet) while keeping
    a get-away caravan running - just in case. Ladies and Gentlemen, prime your F
    keys. There‘s no way that a trebuchet, no matter how many modifications you make,
    will survive the hail of gunfire coming from the rifles and gatling guns of Kuchum
    Khan (Sibir).
- scene_number: "39"
  scene_title: Image 39
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene39.jpg
  narration: Well, we knew that Korea was ahead technologically, but we had no idea
    how far ahead. Sejong shows off his newest brainwave, a ship that sails beneath
    the waves.  (I‘m assuming this is a joke. Or that Sejong managed to bribe some
    passing Babylonians with a year‘s supply of Kimchi. When you live on a sub eating
    rations, Kimchi will buy anything.)
- scene_number: "40"
  scene_title: Image 40
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene40.jpg
  narration: 'The Dead Red cities refuse to finish passing on to the next life. It‘s
    actually somewhat impressive. Get your bets in now: who will go first, Adolf Hitler,
    Casimir III of Poland, or Attila the Hun?'
- scene_number: "41"
  scene_title: Image 41
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene41.jpg
  narration: "Leiria‘s reprieve seems to be coming to an end. Surrounded by the Buccaneer
    warships, it‘s only a matter of time before the city falls and Lisbon becomes
    the only logical target for Henry Morgan‘s first European port of call. \nCanada‘s
    Caravels watch in aghast fascination. You‘d best be taking notes, eh?"
- scene_number: "42"
  scene_title: Image 42
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene42.jpg
  narration: Hitler wins (loses?) the race to annihilation. Or does he? This slide
    shows the Fuhrer running for the hills with his donkeys and wives in tow. Perhaps
    he will reappear later, with a secret island lair or masquerading as Gran Columbia.
- scene_number: "43"
  scene_title: Image 43
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene43.jpg
  narration: This slide shows my favorite children, the Kimberley aboriginals. Like
    Australia, the Kimberley have placed all of their forces on the seas and have
    very few land troops. It‘s like the two are fast friends who trust each other
    to the bitter end. Lame.
- scene_number: "44"
  scene_title: Image 44
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene44.jpg
  narration: "Once again, the Boers have conquered most of the Kongo Koast. Assaulting
    all of what‘s left of the Kongolese cities, Kruger has forced the Kongo Koast
    Guard to split its forces against five points of interest.  \nThis drawn-out war
    has left the Boer-Ethopian border open, guarded only by Workers. Haile Selassie
    could gain much from a quick strike."
- scene_number: "45"
  scene_title: Image 45
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene45.jpg
  narration: "So confident is Henry Morgan (Buccaneers) of a European land operation
    that he has sent land forces -- pikes and muskets -- across the Atlantic. Joining
    him on stage right, Chilean Caravels!  \nAlso note: It‘s very hard to tell Chileans
    from Pirates. I think there‘s three Chilean units on this slide, but I could be
    wrong. In fact, these could all be Chileans, except for the Corsairs."
- scene_number: "46"
  scene_title: Image 46
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene46.jpg
  narration: "In his final dying throes, Atilla promises Kuchum Khan that in exchange
    for his life, he‘ll point the finger at the Meiji. Surprisingly, Sibir spares
    Atilla. For now. \nWhich brings up the question -- what will Kuchum Khan do with
    his massive army? Those men and horses are paid and fed with the blood of formerly
    great leaders. I‘m looking at you, Genghis."
- scene_number: "47"
  scene_title: Image 47
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene47.jpg
  narration: Yakutia and the Inuit. The two enemies seem to have fought more or less
    to a standstill within the frozen mountains of Kamchatka. But Darkhan (Yakutia)
    has dispatched a new  wave of soldiers towards Igloolik where a few lone Inuk
    watch from behind their Inuksuit.  (That‘s a singular Inuit and more than one
    Inuksuk, for the record.)
- scene_number: "48"
  scene_title: Image 48
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene48.jpg
  narration: Chile, in all her glory. Bernard O‘Higgins seems to be building up some
    new forces, spurred on by his wars with Portugal and the Inca. But while he may
    be a strong force in South America, he‘s got nothing on the rest of the world.
    He better hope that Henry Morgan keeps his taste for Pisco Sour long enough to
    allow O‘Higgins to rise to the global level.
- scene_number: "49"
  scene_title: Image 49
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene49.jpg
  narration: |-
    Continuing my previous obsession, Leiria is still not dead, and the Buccaneers warships seem to be thinning, surprisingly enough.
    Of particular personal interest to me, Hastings isn‘t dead yet, either.
- scene_number: "50"
  scene_title: Image 50
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene50.jpg
  narration: Australia, in all her greatness. Maybe it‘s my (hopeful) imagination,
    but Australia seems to be starting to amass land troops and generals on its western
    borders. Perhaps something is up. We can only hope.
- scene_number: "51"
  scene_title: Image 51
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene51.jpg
  narration: This is a rather sparsely populated shot of Vietnam, but what forces
    are here are relatively high in technology compared to Sri Lanka and the Mongols.  On
    the flip side, they‘re low in power compared to South Korea.
- scene_number: "52"
  scene_title: Image 52
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene52.jpg
  narration: Ireland, in all -- I need a better intro line. Malachy II has wrested
    control of all of what should now be called Great Ireland from the British. But,
    his army is so dated that it‘s almost  Ancient. All he needs is one of the other
    nations, Iceland or Snoreway, for instance, to realize that new lands are only
    a quick conquest away.
- scene_number: "53"
  scene_title: Image 53
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene53.jpg
  narration: The Grand Wobbegong Armada is on the move. Wherever it‘s headed, death
    is sure to follow. The Meiji had better sue for piece before there‘s nothing left
    of Japan but the pieces.
- scene_number: "54"

  narration: Once again, the Yo-Yo coast has been painted with a slightly greenish
    shade of yellow. Stay tuned for next slide, when they‘ll be orange again!
- scene_number: "55"
  scene_title: Image 55
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene55.jpg
  narration: 'We get a bird‘s eye view of the Second Bottleneck War. The most interesting
    thing about this slide is the denouncement on the upper right corner. Kuchum Khan
    may have found a new source of blood to feed his Sibir armies: Tibet'
- scene_number: "56"
  scene_title: Image 56
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene56.jpg
  narration: Leiria does not fall to the Buccaneers. Henry Morgan sued for peace when
    he saw an Impi on the shores of Portugal. Any wise leader would. O‘Higgins, however,
    is still at war with Portugal, at least for now.

  narration: 'This slide shows my favorite children, Canada. The true north strong
    and free. And if they want to stay that way, they need to step up their technology
    or production game before Canada falls into irrelevance.  Of note: The Blackfoot
    have gatling guns. Canada does not.'

  narration: The Afghan-Persian war (the Great Rug War) is probably good for both
    nations, giving them the chance to weed out their old units and replace them with
    more powerful units, such as gatling guns and Death Camels.

  narration: 'Speak of the devil, and he will come: the Death Camel, or Zamburak.
    The Zamburak is a ridiculously fast version of the gatling gun, capable of moving
    5 hexes in a single turn.  Which means that a Zamburak built in any of these Afghan
    cities can be on the frontline almost immediately.'

  narration: 'The balance of power has shifted oh so slightly towards Yakutia, but
    Ekeuhnick (The Inuit) has finally mobilized his navy. If it gets around to the
    other side of Kamchatka, Darkhan may have something to worry about, finally.  Of
    Note: the only sea path to the Bay of Kamchatka goes through Japanese waters.
    The Inuit will need peace or war to get there.'

  narration: 'Ladies and Gentlemen, prime your F keys. After hearing about Atilla
    the Hun, the Sioux try to hold off the White Walkers with only a tricked-out trebuchet.
    Two problems: the Inuit have Cannons, and the Sioux don‘t have a getaway camel.'

  narration: A panoramic view of the Icelandic navy. There‘s enough Caravels and Frigates
    here to do some real damage if Ingolfur Arnorson could figure out who to unleash
    them on.

  narration: In this slide, we see my favorite children, the Blackfoot. The Buffalo
    Boys (Bison Boys?) have embraced Autocracy, declaring their intention to rise
    to the top. In their favor, Texas and Canada are behind the curve in technology.
    Unfortunately for them, Mexico and the Inuit are fielding more advanced armies.
    When Ekeuhnick finishes off the Sioux, he may choose to turn on the other Plains
    Indians in the Battle Royale Mark II.

  narration: Autocracy has the rule of the day, with only one Order civ (Afghanistan)
    and one Freedom civ (the United States) shown here. Unsurprisingly, Lincoln‘s
    people think he made the wrong decision. They don‘t want to be the only hated
    people in a world congress full of dictators.

  narration: "The Soviet Union has adopted Order, joining the Afghans in common solidarity.
    \nPet Theory: the reason that Ayyubid prophet is still wandering among all of
    the Asian cities is because that prophet spreads Judaiism, not Islam. He‘s looking
    for a city that doesn‘t already follow the One True God YHWH."

  narration: Stats time! Also known as 'The Part of the Show where we all try to look
    around the box with the stats in it and try find out if the Sioux are dead.'  The
    Maori, Australians and Boers are winning this one, but of special interest is
    Texas and Canada. Population is the stepping stone to science, so Houston and
    Pearson may finally be getting their acts together.

  narration: "Poland, the Huns, and the Sioux. Three nations on the brink of annihilation.
    \ Notice that Germany is not on this list. That Settler must have perished.* Surprisingly,
    Tibet, which hasn‘t lost a city in a long time, is on this list.  \n*Or is paying
    TPang in mulled wine to hide the fact that he‘s founding a secret base in Gran
    Columbia."

  narration: 'Land Area: Australia still has a million square kilometers on the Inuit.
    But the most impressive stat on this list is Sibir: Four and a quarter million
    square kilometers of almost pure  conquest in the hotly contested mid-Asian region.'

  narration: It‘s amazing how small Poland has begun, when it has even less land area
    than the Sioux. If you peak around the stat block, you might be able to see why
    Burma has even less land area than ever before. Just saying

  narration: "As technologically superior as Korea is, the Boers are right up there
    with them. Keep your eyes peeled for a Boer Submarine.  \nJust peaking onto this
    slide: Vietnam. The Trung Sisters are working their way up to the top again. Also
    of note: Brazil."

  narration: Several of these civs are dead or dying, but the most important thing
    to take away is that most of Africa is on this list, whereas the Boers are on
    the other Technology list.

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part27-scene72.jpg
  narration: Australia, the Inuit, the Boer and Sibir are far ahead of the rest of
    the civs. Surprisingly, the Soviet Union is on this list. Perhaps in time they
    will rise against their more tired, war-torn neighbors.

  narration: England, Poland, The Huns, and The Sioux all make up the 1 city club.
    Nzinga Mbande of Kongo made 3 cities by the end of the part.

  narration: This part‘s suprise stat is Great Works! We see that Iceland, with their
    special Great Writers are in the lead with 8 Great Works. The Kimberley, Arabians,
    and surprisingly, the Boers all  bring up the second place.  Sadly, there‘s no
    slide for the philistine iconoclasts at the bottom. Apologies to any Philistine
    fans out there.

  narration: "The world map according to faith. Athiest South America is slowly seeing
    the light of the Catholic Church, brought down by Buccaneer pirates and their
    bread-and-rum communion rituals.  \nAnd with that, Part 27 comes to a close. Thank
    you all for putting up with my delays and for all your support, both for the Civ
    Battle Royale MkII and for all of us mod developers."
