  narration: "<p>Hello all and welcome to our regularly scheduled weekly installment of the CBRX! I, u/Vihreaa, will be narrating this part, and you bet that this week's map is going to be released before you even finish this album. I have the esteemed honor of narrating this special Christmas edition of this week's part, and let me tell you, it’s gonna be a good one. Without further ado, let's begin.</p>"

  narration: "<p>This week's featured OC is created by u/ARedundantSofa, reminding us that Kruger is always watching and observing from the sub. Zimbabwe is currently thriving, but all it takes is one civ from South America to ruin it all. Lets just hope history doesn’t repeat itself in this universe.</p>"

  narration: "<p>u/Vihreaa once again delivers another fantastically amazing map yet again, to nobody’s surprise. This weeks map highlights the changes we’ve seen since last part, with some of the biggest changes we see including Zimbabwe’s occupation of Beta Israel, along with New Zealand becoming one of the few trans-Pacific empires, capturing a city in South America from Selk’nam. </p>"

  narration: "<p>/u/Munkey_Chumbles presents us with a very interesting and controversial view of the cylinder as a sphere (this is of course, blasphemy).  Regardless of this heretic’s portrayal of our world, this map shows the current territorial holdings of the Moors, extending from up north in Iceland to Western Africa in IRL Ghana.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zimbabwe leaps up into our Number one spot for the first time since part 7! It is no wonder, though, with their explosive military growth that is beginning to carpet the cylinder, and their efficient conquest of Beta Israel. Meanwhile, we have Uruguay being unable to take down Kuikuro, who was conquered by the Nazca in just 2 parts, and the Iroquois, who are struggling against the Apache, who seem to have no military at all. </p>"

  scene_title: "“We mean no harm, our units are merely passing through your borders.”"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene06.jpg
  narration: "<p>This week’s part starts off with a seemingly inconspicuous shot of the front between the Haida and the Metis, fighting to a stalemate for the last several parts. What I think is more important to note though, is that we can see Australia and Shikoku’s units starting to carpet foreign lands. Bob Hawke decided since his troops haven’t actually fought anyone in so long, they’d send them on a field trip to a real war zone.</p><p></p><p>To add to this, we can see both Uruguay and the Nazca declaring war on New Zealand, who had just taken a city from Selk’nam. If we glance at the minimap, we can see that the Nazca have captured that city that New Zealand had just captured.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We pan our view over to southern Europe, where we can see the Ottomans just barely holding onto control of Bursa, one of their last two cities. The HRE laughs in the background, seemingly unaware that they might just be next. </p><p>Zimbabwe’s peacekeeping core infiltrates Europe, finding it’s way into countries like Venice, and the Goths if you look in the top corner of the screen. Anyone say reverse colonialism?</p>"

  narration: "<p>Shikoku decides to kick Korea while they’re down, taking advantage of the trait of squishiness they have acquired. They immediately bombard their capital Gangneung into the yellow. </p><p>Haida watches from afar, perhaps poised to strike?</p>"
- scene_number: 09
  scene_title: "Nazca Backdoor Squad"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene09.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see that Nazca has indeed sniped the once Selk’nam city of Ocongalla away from New Zealand, just moments before Uruguay was able to move in for the capture. Selk’nam breathes both a sigh of relief and desperation, as the citizens of HamHam (Hamhmam) hope that they aren’t next. </p>"

  narration: "<p>A small Viking fleet meanders their way between the ocean borders of two giants, the Moors and Uruguay.</p><p>“Captain, I can see Florida in the distance!” </p><p>“Steer clear of it private, we don’t want anything to do with that place.”</p><p>The Vikings sail off, uneasy at the thought of a run in with the infamous Florida Man.</p>"

  scene_title: "Yar-Har Warfare"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Nazca have staged a naval siege on the city of Rotorua, a New Zealand city off the west coast of South America. Though they are unlikely to take it, Rotorua is the base of operations for all of New Zealand’s South American military operations. Off to the east, we can see Shikoku sporting some super carriers, one of the early future worlds units. </p>"

  scene_title: "Stalemate part 27"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Iroquois continue to flounder against the Apache, losing Jaketown, and Poverty Point being in the black. </p><p>Both the Apache and Iroquois have some relatively outdated units though, when you see their army composition. With Great War Infantry and machine guns, they could easily be rolled over by a power with some more advanced units.</p>"
- scene_number: 13
  scene_title: "Ice Sheet Fleet Meet Global Warming"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>This next shot brings us up to the frigid tundra of the North. The Yupik, or Inuit lite if you will, have some terribly outdated units for this time period, sporting riflemen and even some pikemen. It’s only a matter of time until the Metis or maybe even the Haida retake these cities. It’s a shame too, because I imagine a lot of people had high hopes for the Yupik, speaking personally I did, hoping for another Inuit like civ. Unfortunately most of us were disappointed. </p>"

  scene_title: "Unified Japan!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene14.jpg
  narration: "<p>As we move west, we can see that the Korean capital Gangneung has succumbed to Shikoku forces. Interesting fact: with this city capture, Shikoku has now united the entirety of the Japanese archipelago. That means they can form Japan now, right?</p>"
- scene_number: 15
  scene_title: "Zimbabwe carpets the world"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene15.jpg
  narration: "<p>The entire war between the Goths and Prussia has been forced to a standstill because of Zimbabwean peacekeeping forces. To pair with the relative stalemate between the two powers we’ve seen in the last few parts, Zimbabwe will ensure that it will become much more difficult for cities to be captured. We can see Prussia is sporting some impressively large cities, with Konigsburg and Danzig both being greater than 50 pop, with Berlin not far behind. </p>"
- scene_number: 16
  scene_title: "Good God that’s a big city"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Ah, the heartland of New Zealand. The gargantuanly sized capital of Wellington has a population size of 104, which if I recall correctly is more than 400 million people living in that one city, which is insane! The oceans surrounding the Kiwi islands  are heavily carpeted with Kiwi Privateers. Though outdated, their sheer numbers could inflict some damage on opponents. </p><p>We also see sizeable amounts of Uruguayan forces in Kiwi controlled Cavanbah. Perhaps they could capture it, and become the first civilization to control cities on 3 different continents?</p>"

  scene_title: "Top 10 photos taken moments before disaster"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>We approach the frozen shores of Antarctica to meet the Selk’nam city of Korkomen. Untouched by war, the small city has enjoyed peace so far in history. Perhaps this may soon change?</p><p>If we move our focus to the right side of the screen, we can see a joint declaration of war from Taungoo and the Iroquois against the Manx. Though Taungoo may not be able to make much headway, the Iroquois have some borders with the Manx in Greenland, and likely could capture some easy cities.</p>"
- scene_number: 18
  scene_title: "Oh yeah, it’s genocide time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene18.jpg
  narration: "<p>Here we see the aforementioned border between the Iroquois and the Manx, with the Manx defending the city with just riflemen and gatling guns. Facing Iroquois planes and destroyers, it is unlikely that the city of Laxey will last for long. </p><p>In the notification bar on the right side of the screen, we see that Uruguay has constructed the Helios Microwave Power Satellite, which I definitely did not look up the name for. This wonder will further help Uruguay, doubling the yield of solar plants in the empire and causing enemy units adjacent to a solar plant to take 10 damage per turn.</p>"
- scene_number: 19
  scene_title: "I have made a severe and continuous error in my judgement"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Nazca fleet closes in on Rotorua, though the city has yet to face serious bombardment. Though the Nazca appear to be putting up a valiant effort, their navy is primarily composed of Privateers, which will do little to damage the city, much less capture it. The Nazca would either need a stronger airforce or more ranged ships in order to capture this city. </p>"

  scene_title: "Diversity through military expansion"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene20.jpg
  narration: "<p>We transition back to central Europe, where we see what looks to be more foreign peacekeeping units than actual military units from the empires in this shot. We see cameos from Zimbabwe, the Vikings, and also some peacekeepers from Uruguay and Parthia. </p><p>Along with this, we see the Sami declaring war on the Manx. Though they are unlikely to do damage themselves, this could lead to a coalition that could do significant damage. </p>"
- scene_number: 21
  scene_title: "Remember when the HRE was here lol"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene21.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Vikings and Manx were once rather evenly matched, but this shot of the two empires show how far the gap has widened. The Vikings have a huge airforce stationed in what is Denmark and Germany in our world, with modern units like Artillery, Mobile SAM’s, and infantry. The Manx, on the other hand, lag behind,  with Riflemen, Gatling Guns, and no airforce in sight.</p><p>In other news, Uruguay builds another wonder, this time the Shanghai World Financial Center. Providing 1500 gold along with +2 gold from merchants, this wonder won’t do much to help Uruguay. I knew I kept  my Future Worlds reference sheet open for a good reason though.</p>"
- scene_number: 22
  scene_title: "Taungoo Sightseeing"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>Not even an entire part after the occupation of mainland Beta Israel, Zimbabwe has already completely carpeted their former empire, with planes in almost every city. With this military and production bias, Zimbabwe could easily wipe through all of Africa in just a few parts, I’d wager. An entire Taungoo battalion have stationed themselves off the coast, taking notes on an empire that they may have to eventually face on the battlefield, Vietnam-Boer style.</p>"

  scene_title: "Iroquois can into Space?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>The ISS has been completed! With Hiawatha taking the number one spot, he will get some valuable bonuses to his science to help catch up to Uruguay. Interesting to see how the nations that we have noticed have been carpeting have not contributed to the ISS. In the background we can see Zimbabwe carpeting the core of the Goths, making it much more difficult for them to do well, anything.</p>"

  scene_title: "Korean Walls close in"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene24.jpg
  narration: "<p>Shikoku continue their piledrive through Korea, taking Jeonju, leaving Korea with only Gongju and Skedans. It might be just about time to prime your F key, folks, because it is not looking good for our good friend Seonjo.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Didn’t see that coming"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>Color me surprised! The Nazca have taken Rotorua, kicking New Zealand out of mostly all American affairs. The Nazca have quite well benefitted from this war, gaining two cities and at the same time getting to flex their military strength.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>Speaking of conquering, both Qin and The Goths declare war on the Golden Horde, or what’s left of it. Being such a small rump state, it’s only a matter of time before we see the Golden Horde meet their doom. Could we see a double elimination this part?</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Zimbabwe carpet the world part 2"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Unsurprisingly, Hiawatha has made quick work of the former Manx city of Laxey, quickly integrating it into the ever growing Iroquois empire. We can  also see the last part of the world that is yet to be settled, the northernmost portion of Greenland. Though unsettled, the land is most definitely populated, by what appears to be some ancient tribe of funny sounding people with kilts. Is that bagpipes I hear?</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "There’s artistic value in this shot… somewhere"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>We can see just how immense the Australian carpet is in this slide. Empires like this are a ticking time bomb, just waiting to explode onto any empire who is unfortunate enough to not be carpeted themselves and neighboring those civs. We can also see that Uruguay has dealt some damage to Cavanbah, though the last of their melee units were wiped out, eliminating all chance of them actually capturing the city.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Poor Indians man"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>Good heavens, poor India. At this rate, their capital will literally be cut off from the rest of their empire. The Khamugs continue their bombardment of Indian cities, but stand little chance of capturing any with all of the clutter from units from every stretch of the cylinder. We can also see the ever collapsing Nepal in this slide, their cities ripe for the capture, just waiting for a melee unit to find their way in.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Stalemate part 2"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>On the Iroquois-Apache front, we can see that the two nations are really fighting to a stalemate, and they’re both looking worse for wear. After being at war for several parts, neither has managed to make major gains, and the Australian horde is ever approaching, making its way into the western portion of the Apache empire.</p>"
- scene_number: 32
  scene_title: "So this is where it ends huh?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Tick tock. Korea’s time runs short, with Gongju being captured. Down to one city, Seonjo says his prayers. The only question now is who will be the one to take the final city, Shikoku or the Haida?</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Is it Tonga Time? It’s always Tonga Time. Tongan troops move towards the final Aztec city of Tacopan (Tlacopan). With the bottleneck of the Aztec borders and the carpets blocking them out, it is unlikely that Tonga will manage to capture the city. </p>"

  scene_title: "When New Zealand doesn’t know what a ranged boat is"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>A huge fleet of New Zealandic ships comprised of mostly Privateers and submarines approach Selk’nam waters. With a fleet this large, they may be able to make some large gains in Selk’nam territory. But then again, the Nazca might just come capture it from them.</p>"
- scene_number: 37
  scene_title: "I’d like to thank..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>Korea surprisingly survives another turn, much to my surprise. The Haida  seem well positioned to capture the city, though Shikoku may move in at the last second for the capture. Either way, Skedans will most likely be captured next turn, finally extinguishing Seonjo’s last hope at conquering the planet.</p>"
- scene_number: 38
  scene_title: "Stalemate, Haida and Metis edition"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene38.jpg
  narration: "<p>The front between the Haida and Metis shows little movement, with the Metis not showing a real desire to push into Haida territory, even though their land military has the strength of a soggy piece of toast. That’s just the Deity AI for you I guess. They must know what they’re doing, because I can never seem to beat them when I try to in singleplayer games… (860 hours still no Deity win ;-;)</p>"
- scene_number: 39
  scene_title: "Should’ve packed a melee unit..."
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uruguay has successfully gotten Cavanbah into the black, but will ultimately have nothing to show for it, as they don’t have a single melee unit in the area. Another thing I would like to highlight with this slide is the comparison between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand is at quite a disadvantage because of their lack of land mass, giving them significantly less space to hold melee units, while Australia has an entire continent to carpet with troops.</p>"
- scene_number: 40
  scene_title: "Stalemate part 3"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>No real change on the Iroquois and Apache front, with no captures since the last time we saw it. I don’t imagine that we will see much progress from either side, but I have been wrong before, and because the Iroquois are my assigned civ to support, I’d love to see them make more captures.</p>"
- scene_number: 41
  scene_title: "Peace in our time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>After years of war, the Haida and Metis have finally reached a peace agreement. With the Metis no longer occupied in the west, perhaps they will set their sights on the Apache down south? In other news, we see that the Nazca have completed the Manhattan project, and Parthia and the Metis have declared war on the Golden Horde, further digging their grave.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Zimbabwe troops continue to carpet the world, reaching as far as Greenland. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see Zimbabwe troops in North America by at least next part. We also may see the Iroquois capture Hakaye, further cementing the two powers in Greenland, the Iroquois and the Vikings.</p>"

  scene_title: "Oh yeah, it’s go time"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode28-scene43.jpg
  narration: "<p>Selk’nam cities in Antarctica begin to take damage from New Zealand troops, though the fleet appears to be smaller than when we last saw it, possibly thanks in part to the Selk'nam airforce. With 9 planes in just their Antarctic cities, New Zealand will be fighting an uphill battle to make any significant gains.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Apache are making a slow comeback, retaking Poverty Point, a city they once controlled before the beginning of the war. We can observe peacekeepers from the Nazca and Australia as well, signifying that this war between the Apache and Iroquois is on a timer they can’t control, and once its up, nobody will be capturing any cities.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The only reason the Golden Horde is still alive at this point is probably because of Zimbabwe’s peacekeepers so, nice job? Us spectators on the sub want none of that, we want blood. Fortunately for us, The Golden Horde has little time left in their hourglass, soon to meet Korea from beyond the grave.</p>"

  narration: "<p>A new turn, a new batch of wars. We see that Australia has declared war on Qing, which is unlikely to yield any results, and some purple civilization also declared war on Qing. Does anyone know who that is? I surely feel we would have seen something about a civ like that if it even existed. Oh well. Zimbabwe troops also have made it to Metis territory, this doesn’t bode well for the rest of the world.</p>"

I imagine there is a sizeable audience of the CBRX who favored Korea at the start, but unfortunately, their civilization was not one to stand the test of time. Felled by the Haida, Korea meets their final grave, and Seonjo will return to the sub to meet with the rest of the fallen immortals.</p>"

We know that Songhai had a rather small military when they were conquered by the Moors, and currently the Moors have little military in the region. Along with this, several cities in the region are still puppeted, not yet annexed. I believe this could be because the people in the region are very opposed to foreign occupation, and keep the Moors busy, preventing them from fully integrating these cities into their empire.</p>"
