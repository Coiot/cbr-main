  narration: "<p>Wwwwwwwelcome to another edition of the Civ... Battle Rrrrrrroyale. I’m bluesox. You may know me from my roles as the New Units and City Captures tracker for Mk. 2, the host of the Civ Rap Battle Royale (which is still open for registration), or perhaps as the orchestrator of the Battle Royale Stock Exchange (soon to return with a slew of new features for all your speculative desires). If you don’t recognize my username, then welcome to the fold! I’m glad that you’ve discovered the Civ Battle Royale. This is the third full-scale simulation to emerge from r/civbattleroyale, pitting 61 AI competitors against each other for global domination, and the first run under the watch of Blue Cassette. I couldn’t be more delighted to bring you this incredibly action-packed episode, full of twists, turns, and penis jokes. I’m honored to ring in the Twenties by closing out the twenties. This is Episode 29: Roaring Forward!</p>"

  narration: "<p>Our OC of the Week is the latest news from the Prussian Monitor, courtesy of OneHalfCupFlour. This is far and away my favorite series of original content. Years ago I helped create the Battle Royale Network, so it brings me great joy to see how OneHalfCupFlour has executed that idea with such polish and consistent witticism. If you haven’t yet, I encourage you to search for “Prussian Monitor” on r/CivBattleRoyale and read through the issues to see how the world has evolved through the ages with that farm-raised grass-fed free-range organic 100% fair trade Grade A five-star flair that only Prussian propaganda can provide.</p>"

  narration: "<p>And the obligatory inclusion of the latest Hand-Drawn Map by Vihreaa gives us the best possible look at the cylinder as we left it. Take a good long look, because there may be a quiz on this later.</p><p></p><p>I suppose I’ll add some filler and let the image sink in. You are about to encounter a mix of analysis, speculation, open bias, recurring gags, and uncharacteristically juvenile humor. There are also a few stray expletives. In other words…</p><p></p><p>Rob Schneider’s just a regular guy who likes to watch football. He eats pizza and plays Call of Duty on weekends. Until one day, he wakes up as <record scracth> the Civ Battle Royale! Now he’s giving life one more turn. With low-brow humor and shoehorned punchlines in his arsenal, he’s declaring war on frowny faces. But if he wants to slay the audience he better think fast before he gets…”Uh, oh!” ...eliminated. Rob Schneider is Seabricks. Rated PG-13.</p>"

  narration: "<p>I’m giving it a 50/50 shot between Iroquois and Uruguay to be in the top spot this week, but in all honesty they’re two sides of the same coin to me. Think about it. Iroquois. Uruguay. They’re basically the same word in different regional dialects. Nobody really likes either of them. One is designed to dominate single-player campaigns. One is designed to dominate Battle Royale campaigns. The fact that they’re at each other’s throats only gives the rest of the cylinder a glimmer of hope, which is all I ask at this point.</p><p></p><p>What if it’s actually Zimbabwe? There’s no way they jump to number one just because Madagascar is inept. Is there? No, that’s crazy talk.</p>"

  narration: "<p>We start where we left Episode 28, off the Gulf of Haiti… er, Venezuela. Haiti had a good run, but after squandering their chances in the early game, their elimination was assumed. The question that remained concerned which civ would strike the killing blow. Good job by Venezuela here, consolidating the entire southern region of the Gulf to help fend off any naval attacks from the East.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and Uruguay has reclaimed Teiaiagon from the Iroquois. I’m especially excited to be able to be here for this battle of the titans. Let’s see how it unfolds!  </p>"

  narration: "<p>Venezuela shows us another side of their competent defensive strategy with this war-weathered fleet in place to block naval attacks from the west. However, were Tonga to strike now, they could send this entire detachment to the bottom of the Pacific in just a couple of turns.</p>"

  narration: "<p>As predicted in Episode 28, the one-tile lane along the Arctic perimeter has stalled any progress by either the Qing or the Yu’pik here. Expect it to stay that way until either side exercises the nuclear option.</p><p></p><p>In other news, it’s now Tonga-thirty as they come to their senses and give up their assault on Tlacopan to avoid the warmongering penalty.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene11.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Apache claim Lépai-Ndé from the Iroquois, but a Tongan peacekeeping force keeps either side of the Apache-Iroquios skirmish from inflicting much further damage aside from the occasional air raid. Thankfully, Blue Cassette has opened discussion for solutions to the Peacekeeper Problem™ that has plagued the CBR all the way back to Mk 1. Please join the discussion on Discord and the subreddit. Make your voice heard! There’s far too much PP™ on the map, and the upcoming decision will have a much larger impact than any contestants or additional mods that may be added to the game.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene12.jpg
  narration: "<p>Despite having a very thin army, the Moors have still been productive. As this armada clearly shows, their main concern is keeping pace in the arms race with their western neighbor, Uruguay. Not that it will make any difference in the long run, but it’s a good effort.</p>"

  scene_title: "Jake ‘n’ Bake"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene13.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the dual-sided war that the Apache are waging, would anyone have guessed that Venezuela would have better success than the Iroquois this Episode? So far that is the case, but if there’s been any lesson to learn these past few Episodes it’s that momentum can shift in an instant.</p>"

  narration: "<p>The Iroquois put their Future Era units to use, recapturing not just Teiaiagon but Fólibéte and Itsagahiti, apparently with the help of a flying manta ray. Furthermore, with Ganneious holding onto a sliver of health they’re poised to send Uruguay reeling back to San Carlos. </p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene16.jpg
  narration: "<p>Holding true to real life, we see the list of civs we love to hate… I mean view the most. Speaking of which, we haven’t gotten a good look at the Sami or Taungoo cores in a while. I wonder if they have anything to show us this time around.</p>"

  scene_title: "North American Givers"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene17.jpg
  narration: "<p>Lépai-Ndé is once again Iroquois, thanks to a peace treaty that is sure to last exactly ten turns. This should come as good news to Iroquois fans, since they can now give their full attention to the Iro-Guay war.</p><p></p><p>With no conflict to obstruct, the Tongan peacekeepers move eastward. Perhaps they’re planning a sneak attack! Wouldn’t that be fun? No worries to fans of future peace, though, as the Métis and Nazca have filled in to take their place.</p><p></p><p>Zimbabwe watches.</p>"

  narration: "<p>With few cities left to defend, Madagascan troops are resigned to roam the African mainland in the hopes that they may be conscripted to fight as mercenaries in a foreign war and rebuild their empire with fortunate timing. However, every turn that passes leaves them further obsolete and diminishes that possibility.</p>"

  scene_title: "Pacific Powder Keg"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene19.jpg
  narration: "<p>With three naval powerhouses sharing a common border point, this location is destined to get much more attention in the future. It’s strange to think of Australia as a powerhouse again, but their success against the Murri several episodes ago has ensured they will once again be ranked annoyingly high for the foreseeable future.</p><p></p><p>The saving grace here is the lack of full naval carpets from any of the three civs. Take a moment to enjoy this scene while it remains peaceful.  </p>"

  narration: "<p>Uruguay wins another game of Carribean tennis, pushing the Iroquois back to Teiaiagon one more. It also seems that the Tongan peacekeepers have reached their destination.</p><p></p><p>I like to think of the Tongan peacekeepers as a group of soldiers who uncovered old texts from ancient times while traversing the Pacific isles. Now they’re deserters in Hare Krishna robes with flowers in their helmets, wandering around the cylinder to spread the word of Kamehameha the First to any and all who will listen.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Kazakhstan raises their happiness and culture with every Broadcast Tower by completing the Tokyo SkyTree, expanding the reach of their transmissions boasting superior potassium.</p><p></p><p>In other news, Shikoku is poised to take the current Qing capital of Wuchang! I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the Shikoku mod crafted by our very own Homusubi. It’s been a long time since I’ve played a game of Civ myself, but I’ll most definitely be using this mod in the next one. Just have to remember to use an Archipelago map to maximize their UA. Great job on this mod, Homusubi!</p>"

  scene_title: "Have You Ever Had Elk Meat, Though? It’s Delicious!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene22.jpg
  narration: "<p>New Zealand is not keen on the Selk’nam regaining control of their western isles and sends a handful of ships to rectify the situation. He wisely starts with Elk, which has seen their air force depleted from five to two ships. However, Seddon understands that zero ships is better than two when it comes to oppositional forces.</p>"

  scene_title: "Wuchang Clan IS Something To Fuck With"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene23.jpg
  narration: "<p>And Shikoku snipes Wuchang from Cixi! This is a glorious day for Shikoku supporters all around as they now have a base north of the mountains to infiltrate mainland Asia. If history has taught us anything, it’s that civs in this region can’t be bothered to put up any sort of commendable defense (Goddamnit, Forgie) leaving the path wide open for Shikoku to become the East Asian superpower of the future. </p>"

  narration: "<p>Venezuela continues to show they deserve their place in the CBR by taking another city off of the Apache. They continue to impress by solidifying control of the Gulf with the capture of Tsézhiné.</p><p></p><p>In other news, the Goths decide the Seljuqs are no longer worth their time.</p>"
- scene_number: 25
  scene_title: "Too Beaucoup"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene25.jpg
  narration: "<p>In this scene, the PP™ has overtaken the Eastern Seaboard as we see more peacekeepers than native units. The reasoning for this should have fans of the Iroquios concerned. They are losing a LOT of units in the Iro-Guay War, and will not be able to haemorrhage units at this rate much longer just for control of three indefensible islands. Even worse, Uruguay is focusing their attack on Deseroken, where the Iroquois have foolishly consolidated half of their air force in the region.</p>"

  scene_title: "Losing Their Merv"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene26.jpg
  narration: "<p>In the middle of the screen stands the 30-population city of Merv. With zero HP left, it’s practically begging to be captured. Yet, nobody seems desperate enough to send a melee unit. The Goths would, but the futility and suffering endured by the Golden Horde has practically turned them into Goths as it is.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the city, however, Benin has thrown up the largest middle finger to Parthia by completely blocking any chance of them advancing on the city, proving that it isn’t the size of the PP™ that matters, but how it’s put to use.</p><p></p><p>Zimbabwe watches.</p>"

  scene_title: "Loose Changsha"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene27.jpg
  narration: "<p>They thought they were gangsta, but they never capped nothing. Now they’re stuck in Changsha, and they need to stop running.</p><p></p><p>Nearby Wuchang once again ain’t nothing to fuck with. Now reinforced by Power Rangers, any chance of a Qing retaliation is no more. At least Shikoku was nice enough to grant open borders to the Yu’pik so they can feel like they’re helping.</p>"
- scene_number: 28
  scene_title: "Outta Nowhere!"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene28.jpg
  narration: "<p>Deseroken has fallen to Uruguay, dealing a MASSIVE blow to the Iroquois. Putting all their eggs in one basket cost them dearly, as a whopping TEN air units have been destroyed in one blow. They would be wise to peace out for a few turns and regroup now that their long-range strategy is neutered for the moment.</p>"
- scene_number: 29
  scene_title: "Tonga Time And A Half"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene29.jpg
  narration: "<p>As if fending off the Nazca isn’t enough of a challenge, Tonga has decided to take on the Eldritch Horror itself. This is mostly a strategic move to gain favor with New Zealand, which I can’t knock them for. However, once tensions boil over with Australia, it’s going to put them in a very tenuous position. Although, that may be giving them too much credit for lasting that long, considering they’re still sporting Classical Era ships when faced with battleships and submarines.</p>"
- scene_number: 30
  scene_title: "Fresh Bread"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene30.jpg
  narration: "<p>The stalemate on this border has broken as the Apache find a way around the PP™ and into Iroquois territory. How effective it will be remains to be seen, as Chihéné is just barely clinging to life and the current Apache capital (You’re welcome, Dawkinzz) is taking damage.</p>"
- scene_number: 31
  scene_title: "Well, Isn’t That Special?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene31.jpg
  narration: "<p>With the Apache conflict on hold and the Iro-Guay war raging on, the Iroquois can’t risk turning their backs to their hated neighbors to the north. The Métis look fully prepared to stage an invasion at a moment’s notice. Good thing Ottawa has started training their Unique Unit, the Iroquois Special Forces, which gets additional movement and coastal bonuses. These units should prove useful in their current battle with Lavalleja.</p>"

  scene_title: "Poor Lamar"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene32.jpg
  narration: "<p>Uruguay descends… or ascends, depending how you look at it, on Porlamar. They’re not messing around this time, sending enough troops to reclaim the island five times over. </p><p></p><p>Gaining control of the entire eastern border up to the IRL Carolinas is actually a saving grace for everyone on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (except for the Iroquois, of course). This will limit any transatlantic wars to simply be glorified denouncements for diplomatic gain, unless either side can gain enough favor with Uruguay to be granted open borders.</p>"

  scene_title: "Roto Rooters"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene33.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Nazca have exposed a crack in Tonga’s Pacific beltline and snaked their way through the hairy mass of ships clogging the path to Haveluloto, plunging thousands of Tongan soldiers to the ocean floor. They have begun to drain the city of health, and may clear the way for a pipeline to Asia. However, flooding into Asiatic lands would require a joint effort, requiring them to possibly form a union with unexpected allies.</p><p></p><p>How can I cram another plumbing reference into this scene? Super Mario. Yeah. That works.</p>"

  scene_title: "A Kiwi Elk?"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene34.jpg
  narration: "<p>Elk now rests in the hands of Seddon, and the Selk’nam better find a way to call it quits before the cavalry arrives. There’s quite a healthy collection of naval vessels heading toward the frontlines, and nearly every one of them is carrying a land unit. This does not bode well for the Selk’nam at all. Their best hope is to orchestrate an accord in the next World Congress and bribe one of New Zealand’s neighbors to stage a surprise assault before fiery death makes landfall.</p>"

  scene_title: "COMMENCE THE MASTER PLAN"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene35.jpg
  narration: "<p>I can’t quite put into words how thrilled I am to be narrating this part. This is the exact moment I have been waiting for. After 28 and a half episodes, I can finally unscissor my fingers. “Why?” you may ask. It’s the moment of reckoning.</p><p></p><p>INDIRA GANDHI HAS JUST. COMPLETED. THE MANHATTAN PROJECT.</p><p></p><p>This is huge. With our very own Scissor_Fingers giving India an absurdly high (as in maxed out) Build Nuke and Use Nuke bias, the Himalayas are mere turns away from becoming a glowing wasteland. I pity any nation that dares to declare war against India. With such a high tendency for nuclear annihilation, I wouldn’t put it past her to declare war against unrelated nations just to clear out neighboring peacekeepers.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and yet another wonder goes to Uruguay. This time it’s the Orbital Refinery, granting them 12 free Nanomaterials, along with +2 production from Factories and Nanomaterial Plants. What’s their production per turn now? It must be nearing five figures at this point, if it hasn’t already cleared that threshold.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene36.jpg
  narration: "<p>I’m not quite sure how it happened or who’s to blame here, but save for the stretch south of Tchihende every citadel on the screen has been pillaged. Perhaps someone from Blue Cassette can fill us in.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, there’s a more amusing situation afoot. It appears that, despite the main conflict in the area being put on hold, war is still raging in North America. The opposing peacekeepers brought by Tonga and the Nazca are fighting each other on the Iroquois-Apache border. How ironic.</p>"

  scene_title: "Changshit"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene37.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Yu’pik have retreated from their war with Cixi, leaving a damaged privateer on the frontlines in a measly attempt at intimidation, while the rest of the world takes pity on the rump state and withdraws from any involvement in the skirmish. This leaves their final stronghold on a silver platter for Shikoku, who look keen to take the bait that will ensure ire from the rest of the cylinder, followed by an immediate dogpile. Welp, good luck, boys.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, I’ve taken a liking to the Shikoku, partly because of Homusubi’s involvement in the last Civ Rap Battle Royale. (Registration is still open for the upcoming tournament, by the way. Head to r/civrapbattleroyale to sign up!) My favorite part of this current Battle Royale is that we get to see civs created by our own community put to the test in the ultimate meat grinder, and I will give all of them my full support as we go forward. Except Uruguay, because they’re just too darn good at this. However, I’m still holding onto hope that someone… anyone… can snipe that juicy capital and cripple them by plundering all their wonders.</p>"

  narration: "<p>Wait! What!? How?! That’s right, folks. As it always was, it shall always be… TONGA TIME! Rotorua once again takes on a less sickening shade as the Nazca lose their island outpost. With lesser tech and fewer units I honestly didn’t see this coming, and continue to be stunned by Tonga’s strategic prowess on a weekly basis. Could they be our true saviors, the destined liberators of Montevideo?</p>"

  scene_title: "Pincer Attack"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene39.jpg
  narration: "<p>The Kiwi claw grips Xo’on Uhan-Té by the ball-shaped islands as Seddon paves the way for a two-pronged attack, and Australia clearly wants absolutely no part of it. Strangely enough, it appears the land units jumped overboard before the fleet made its approach on the Selk’nam. Although a bit confusing, it’s not a bad strategy if you ask me. Let the ships roll in and take the most damage, then follow in with ground reinforcements to secure territory. I’ll have to try that next time.</p>"

  scene_title: "Para-peacetrooper"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene40.jpg
  narration: "<p>What have we here? It appears Lavalleja’s good buddy Mutota has had enough of his shenanigans and is blocking Uruguay from taking Porlamar. Yet, the city is ripe enough for the taking that the Guay troops off its shore can’t stop trying anyway, leaving Deseroken undefended long enough for the Iroquois to reincorporate it into the motherland. Thanks, Mutota. You’re not so bad after all.</p>"

  scene_title: "Black or White"
  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene41.jpg
  narration: "<p>Looks like the Selk’nam don’t have to wait for the next World Congress after all! After a healthy dose of FOMO, Seddon has made the jump on Siaosi to get a taste of Tonga Time himself. Any RPG player here can tell you that light deals double damage versus dark, and vice versa. But with both sides on the screen already embroiled in transpacific conflicts as it is, that effectively halves the powers these two Oceanic military masters have at their disposal, making this an even match. Tonga clearly has more units on display, but we can’t forget the detachment left behind a couple of scenes ago. That Kiwi Pincer Attack is still in place, and now has an extra option on its plate.</p><p></p><p>Seriously, though, this could be devastating for New Zealand. After being eviscerated by Taungoo a short while ago, this is likely the second worse move the Kiwis could make, close behind a full-scale invasion of Australia. I don’t have much hope for them, but I am greatly optimistic about Tonga’s chances here. They could easily add another five or six cities to their empire if they leave a minimal defense around Rotorua and let the Nazca slog it out for control for the next few turns. This will be a fun one to watch.</p>"

  slide_url: https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/season1-episode29-scene42.jpg
  narration: "<p>The detachment is detached no more as New Zealand proves the earlier theory correct. The land units in waiting are now descending on the Selk’nam mainland after Seddon has taken control of the entire western archipelago.</p><p></p><p>I hate to say it, Dawkinzz, but things don’t look good for your boys in yellow here. The Selk’nam are fielding woefully outdated units, and their greatest hope is an Australian blockade. Short of Seddon turning his full attention toward Tonga, or Uruguay taking offense to someone beating up on little brother, it appears that the doom clock has started for the Eldritch Horror. LOVECRAFT is writing the final chapter as time marches on. </p>"

This is actually a huge blessing to Shikoku, saving them from that warmonger penalty. But wow. This episode is just chock full of surprises! Cixi can’t be counted out, though.
