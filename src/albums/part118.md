  narration: "Hello everyone and welcome the the Civilization Battle Royale: Mk. 2! I am your host for today,\n/u/jmangelo67. Head of the Power Rankings team and the creator of the SoonTM to be released\nLibya mod to be featured in the upcoming CBRX game! I narrated the part “Break Down the\nWalls” in which many cities, including ancient Jericho, were nuked off the face of the Cylinder,\nand I am glad to be back to narrate once again. Here we see Pedro hoisting the Babylonian\nGauntlet and, once he gathers all of the Civilization Stones, he will snap his fingers and bring\nabout worldwide carnivale…"

  narration: "Once again we see the state of the world and, unless your name is Pedro II or Henry Parkes, it\ndoesn’t seem like life is going to be very easy for you in the coming turns, although the latter\nwill join to Bad Life Club pretty soon."

  narration: "Here we see life from the beginning. Rather than show off a second map, I thought it would be\nnice to remind us all of where we started and where we are now. So many have left us and joined\nthe annals of BR history. To think three years ago we had sixty-one civilizations battling it out\nfor supremacy, where the Yakuts were a regional power, The Kongo was one of the mightiest\nempires, Canada was battling back the frozen hordes, and little Dom Pedro was holding hands\nwith Eva Peron, Bernardo O’Higgins, and Pachacuti… Where has the time gone?\nCoiot‘s Note: To view the timelapse preoperly, go to this slide‘s individual page: http://civbattleroyale.tv/albums/d72f39bc4f0a8630721bda05106a894d/content/8f1cf9925ebe021bd3360bc434db9539/"

  narration: "Brazil remains the top position in the rankings as always. I will not bore you with the reasons as\nto why. If you don’t know why they’re in first? Well, you should be more observant."

  narration: "The assault continues in Alaska! The Alaskan cities here can be seen bombarded, but holding out\nwith some soldiers. Some Inuit fans may rejoice in seeing that the Inuit haven’t given up yet;\nhowever, I would like to point out the outdated Artillery unit in Samara. It has become so\ndesperate that Ekehunick has resorted to using the old weapons in his museums."

  narration: "Uqsuqtuuq, Tara, and Miahwaptsik have all fallen to Brazil whilst other cities in the region are\nbeing shelled out. Uqsuqtuuq is likely to return to Inuit hands, however."

  narration: "Reydarfjall has fallen to Brazil! Iceland continues to scramble to defend its last Greenlandic\nholdings. You’d think Iceland would be the next to go with this slide, but one other civ might\nbeat Iceland to it..."

  narration: "Gustavus Adolphus, the Lion of the North, valiantly battles back the Brazilian menace to no\navail. As Skara falls to the Brazilian hordes, Sweden holds five cities to Iceland’s six. Who will\nwin the race for 8th?"

  narration: "Sibir continues to be bombarded, but they are holding out on the Western front so far! They have\nconsolidated their forces into the Siberian sea, however, and it would behoove Kuchum Khan to\nmove his forces to the border rather than protect just Gorky and Dijon. The Hit and Run Tactics\nof Sibir may aid them, however, as he could consolidate his forces after protecting his small\nnorthern cities."

  narration: "Here we see the real battle. Sibir lives up to its reputation as the meatgrinder of the Battle\nRoyale, but there is one small issue. Qashliq, the capital of the Sibirian Empire, is looming\ntowards capture. Surrounded by all sides with only an Artillery to defend it, Sibir may lose yet\nanother capital in the Total War"

  narration: "The Mongolian holdings of New Sarai and Rutog in southern Sibir are facing Brazilian forces,\nbut they are relatively in better spots than other parts of the empire. Rutog may fall to Brazil\nbased on its proximity to Brazil, but its high city defense value may make it a tough fight."

  narration: "On the Eastern border of Sibir, Ortrar is relatively safe and the previously destroyed city to its\neast has become reclaimed tile for Sibir. The eastern Brazilian forces are sparse here and, if not\nfor the war in the West, Sibir could actually fight back against Brazil. Not win, of course, but put\nup a good scrap!"

  narration: "If the Sibirian Biotrooper in the Northeastern border of Sibir and Brazil moved south, he could\ntake the city of Tyokhtyur and consolidate. On another note, notice the pure lack of units in this\narea. Both sides are relatively peaceful here, but I only imagine it is because of the countless\ndeaths in this region."

  narration: "Meanwhile, the Chukotkan Peninsula’s Inuit forces face severe Brazilian threat. As Olenyo\nRusskoye Ustye prepare to fall to Brazil, the transcontinental empire of the Inuit, the first of its\nkind, prepares its ceasing of existence."

  narration: "Wotjulum falls to Brazil! God Dawkinzz, you are not getting a break here with the names. Aside\nDawkinzz’ poor tongue, Korea joins the Scandinavians in the Race for 8th! Although Korea may\nbe better off than the Scandinavian forces, Korea may, and I mean just may, reach 8th. With his\ncity count and diverse geography, however, Korea may have to fight in Race for 7th."

  narration: "Vietnam loses Mandalay and Indapura, with Co Loa CERTAIN to fall next! The Vietnamese\nhave now entered the Race! Also to note is that the Trungs have positioned most of their forces\naround Hanoi, their last and domestic capital."

  narration: "Whereas Brazil has moved their forces towards Asia and Europe and the war gets no less intense,\nwe find an empty void in Oceania. Western Australia is totally empty of both Brazilian and\nAustralian units…"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part118-scene19.jpg'
  narration: "The islands north of Australia too are empty of units. I’d blame this on the peace deals between\nthe two powers, but the total void of units just seems totally odd. It has brought the war between\nAustralia and Brazil to a standstill at the very least. Perhaps it is because Brazil has taken Japan,\nand the study of old anime like DragonBall Z, where episodes totally devoted to staredowns, is\nthought of by the Brazilians to be a good military tactic."

  narration: "Coff’s Harbour, my favourite city that is not Brazilian on the cylinder, is totally safe. Again, an\nempty sea. I wonder how much wreckage from the Garbage Patch and the Wobbegong are at the\nbottom of that ocean…"

  slide_url: 'https://cdn.civbattleroyale.tv/mark2-part118-scene21.jpg'

  narration: "Igluugarjuk and Wahpetonwan fall to Brazil. Some had expected the rough and undesirable\nterrain would have slowed down Brazil like it did with the Boers, but it seems like Brazil is\nbeing a bit more aggressive with the Inuit this time around."

  narration: "Qashliq barely clings on as another meatgrinding slaughter occurs on the southwestern border of\nSibir! Just imagine the charging cybernetic armies firing at each other and the carnage. It is both\nexciting and saddening to see."

  narration: "Nagat falls surprisingly, as Sibir must have had to consolidate its forces in more important and\nbrutal parts of the country whereas Brazil had the forces to spare."

  narration: "Ruskoye Ustye falls as predicted and Olenyo is set to fall soon as well. Impressively, Mukhtu\nsports and impressive 206 city defensive strength. That might be a tougher nut to crack, but this\nis just an observation."

  narration: "Korea sports an impressive military in their last stand around Hamhung, though their city of\nHamhung should be their last concern…"

  narration: "Is that Sweden only has three as as Eidsvoll and Lipsala crumble! Sweden is EXTREMELY\nsurrounded now. I would like to call this Race for 8th here, but Gustavus is not officially dead\nyet! And to think the last time I narrated a part, it was over who would win the war in Europe:\nIceland or Sweden. Now I sit here taking bets as to which would die first."

  narration: "I never imagined the day that this would happen, but Qashliq has fallen. It looks securely in\nPedro’s hands, but the fight is not over yet for Sibir! For those who are not fans, I want everyone\nto take a second and realize that this filler civilization was meant as just that, a filler. It’s colour\nscheme was grey and white to take away attention in the BR. But let me tell you something…\nThese guys were an empire. And those that are or were fans of Sibir and are a part of\n/r/SibiriousContenders, I want you to know that from the outside looking in, I’d be pretty damn\nproud to have backed these guys.
