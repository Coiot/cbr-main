# What is the Civ Battle Royale?

Hello everyone, welcome to the Civ Battle Royale (**CBR**). The Civ Battle Royale is a weekly online show of a massive 61 AI-only epic running Civilization V. No human intervention in the show as a months-long game is recorded and then curated into episodes across the action. Episodes are narrated by members of our 10k+ sized community cheering on the AIs on their unpredictable path to victory.

The Civ Battle Royale is its own niche in the Civilization community; it attracts people from different cultural and technical backgrounds to add their own interpretations and input to jointly create an emergent narrative for the actions of the show’s AI competitors.

The Civ Battle Royale is hosted on its own website, with community discussion on [our subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/) and [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/565JwaMsuQ). The show is run by members of **Blue Cassette**: Coiot, Dawkinzz, Limaeus, Reon Monterus, Lunar Needle.
