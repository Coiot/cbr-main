## What is the Civ Battle Royale?

Hello everyone, welcome to the Civ Battle Royale (**CBR**). The Civ Battle Royale is a bi-weekly online show of a massive 61 AI-only epic running Civilization V. No human intervention in the show as a several months long game is recorded and then curated into episodes across the action. Episodes are narrated by members of our 10k+ sized community cheering on the AIs on their unpredictable route to victory.

The Civ Battle Royale is its own niche in the Civilization community; it attracts people from different cultural and technical backgrounds to add their own interpretations and input to jointly create an emergent narrative for the actions of the show’s AI competitors.

Today the Civ Battle Royale is hosted here on its own website but still has a discussion home here on [our subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/civbattleroyale/). The show is run by members of **Blue Cassette**: Coiot, Dawkinzz, Limaeus, Reon Monterus, Lunar Needle.

## Release Schedule

Episodes of the Civ Battle Royale are released every two weeks at 12AM UTC time.
